Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2005 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and CEO and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained within this presentation and is also contained in our SEC filings, which are on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the SEC rules. As required by these rules, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP measures on the same web page as our presentation slides. As you know, we closed our merger transaction with MCI on January 6, 2006. As such, the results we will be discussing today are of those of the Verizon stand-alone business for the fourth quarter and full year 2005. Before turning the call over to Doreen, I would like to direct you to some information on our reported and adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $0.64. On a reported basis, EPS was $0.59. For full year 2005, adjusted EPS was $2.56, representing 2% growth over $2.51 of adjusted EPS in 2004. Reported EPS was $2.65 in 2005 and $2.79 in 2004. The special items that make up the differences between reported and adjusted EPS are discussed in the earnings release and provided in reconciliation tables within our financial statements. For the fourth quarter of 2005, these items principally related to previously announced changes to management benefit plans, severance and relocation costs. With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen.\nDoreen Toben, EVP, CFO: Thanks, Ron and good morning to everyone. Verizon delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. Our strong fourth quarter capped the year in which we achieved some major strategic goals and strengthened our position in key growth markets. Our strategies are really starting to take hold and you can see it in our financial and operating results this quarter. As a result, we enter 2006 with excellent momentum and a business that is performing extremely well across the board. I'll take you through the details of our fourth quarter results but here are the headlines. Customers are responding very strongly to our products. In fact, we set industry records in both wireless and broadband net adds. More new customers than any other wireless company, Telco or cable company has posted in a single quarter. We accelerated our revenue growth at 6.7%. We made important progress in creating the growth markets of the future with our EV-DO and FiOS initiatives, which are both gaining scale and customers. We also prepared for our merger with MCI, which positions us for growth in the large business market. And we showed, once again, that we can invest in growth and still generate solid cash flows, margin and earnings growth. All in all, we are pleased with the strong finish to the year with great momentum going into a very exciting 2006. Now, let's take a closer look at our consolidated results, starting with revenues. On chart four, you can see our steady growth trajectory. Quarterly revenues increased by 1.2 billion or 6.7% and annual revenues grew 4.2 billion or 6%. Full year revenues were just shy of 75 billion, representing more than a 9 billion increase in three years. Our key growth areas are becoming an increasingly larger piece of our total revenues and compose nearly 60% of our fourth quarter total. The next chart shows the components of our revenue stream and clearly demonstrates the increasing diversification of our revenue profile. We have three network businesses, Wireless, wireline, serving residential and business customers. Wireline also includes a large and very healthy wholesale business and an enterprise business. As you know, earlier this month, we completed our acquisition of MCI, which will increase our presence in the large business market. Our growth initiatives are diversifying our revenue profile and helping to mitigate our competitive risk. We are also gaining momentum with these initiatives across the entire business. You can see for yourself on this slide. Customer connections, the combination of switched access lines, broadband connections and wireless subscribers, up 5.7%, wireless data revenue, now a 2.2 billion annual revenue stream, up more than 100%. Wholesale data traffic volumes with double-digit growth. And an increasing appeal among residential customers for some kind of bundle or package of products from us. Another key point here is that we are seeing increasing demand for our services across the board. Turning to margins, we delivered our fourth straight quarter of margin growth, even as we're continuing to invest today for better growth tomorrow. Adjusted operating income margins, excluding pension and OPEB costs were 22.1% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 90 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-over-year. And as you know, growth initiatives initially create downward pressure on margins. Since we are committed to margin stability and ultimately to margin expansion, it is mission critical to drive other costs out of the business by increasing efficiencies and productivity throughout the entire organization. And I can assure you we never lose sight of that fact. We view driving down costs as a critical matter of financial execution, especially as we expect to continue to grow our customer base or have existing customers take multiple products and services from us. This is extremely important as we remain committed to capturing the growth opportunities that will drive future revenue and earnings growth. During 2005, we maintained fairly consistent quarterly earnings performance, as you can see on the top of slide seven. For the year, adjusted EPS was $2.56, representing 2% growth over 2004. While this is modest growth, I believe it demonstrates our capacity to manage cost-effectively and offset the initially dilutive effects of growth initiatives. Final solutions for the full year 2005 was worth $0.15 as compared to the $0.04 in 2004. In addition, I would point out that the net pension and OPEB expense had a $0.30 negative impact on EPS in 2005, compared to a $0.21 in 2004. So, from a bottom line perspective, we were able to preserve earnings stability, even as we made significant investments in network platforms that will fuel future revenue and earnings growth. Let's take a look at slide 8. 2005 was another year of strong cash generation and our balance sheet is stronger than ever, something that I'm particularly proud of. CFFO, which totaled 22 billion for the year, was strong in both the wireline and wireless business. Our 2005 capital spending was on target with previous guidance. The increase over 2004 spending reflects our focus on growth opportunities. In fact, 69% of our capital spending in 2005 was related to growth initiatives. Total debt levels were maintained in spite of the increase in capital spending and wireless spectrum purchases. Our credit metrics are the strongest they've ever been. For example, our net cash flow to debt ratios finished the year at over 50%, our best ever. Let's begin our segment review with wireless. Simply put, these are the best wireless quarterly results from any carrier ever. If you take a look at any of the metrics from growth through profitability to loyalty, Verizon Wireless has equaled or surpassed its own industry record results. And we continue to demonstrate that the growth engine we have built just keeps getting better with time. Net adds for the quarter were an industry record 2.05 million. Retail post-paid net adds were 1.76 million for the quarter. Total customers now stand at 51.3 million, which is 17.2% higher than last year. For the full year, we added 7.5 million customers. I think that's a number that bears repeating. We added 7.5 million customers during the year. 7.1million of whom were retail post-paid. Our success is the result of capitalizing on opportunities and leveraging our strong fundamentals and networks to capture market share. And with our commitment to quality, we are seeing very strong customer loyalty. Our customer base is about 96% retail. Total churn of 1.22% tied our previous record and our retail post-paid churn of 1.02% was also near all-time lows. These results show that it really is the network and our award-winning service that attracts and retains customers. Slide 10 shows our very strong revenue growth trends over the past five quarters. Total revenues grew 18.3%, reflecting the phenomenal growth that we had this quarter. Quarterly revenues have increased over $1.3 billion in just one year, which is incredible. As a matter of fact, I suggest there are very few 30 billion plus businesses that are growing revenues at this kind of pace. Service revenue was up 963 million or almost 15% compared with fourth quarter last year, driven by data usage and the good customer profile of new adds. Service ARPU was $49.36, down 1.9% year-over-year, representing about 100 basis point improvement in the year-over-year run rates from the second and third quarter. This improvement is attributable to increasing data usage as well as strong customer mix. Wireless data is an increasingly big part of the Verizon Wireless story. At 731 million, data revenue accounted for almost 10% of fourth quarter service revenues. Data contributed $4.85 of ARPU, up from $4.23 last quarter very strong sequential growth. Almost half of our retail customers are data users, up significantly from this time a year ago. And we're seeing strong uptake on Broadband Access cards and PDAs from corporate customers, thanks to our extensive EV-DO network. The key to our success in wireless data is our commitment to investing in the network. The result is a first-mover advantage, which has really separated us from our competition in terms of coverage and experience in delivering broadband services. Our EV-DO network gives us, by far, the most pervasive wireless broadband coverage of any carrier in the marketplace. We now offer 24 different EV-DO broadband devices, the most of any carrier. We have six PC cards, eight PDAs and 10 handsets in the market today. We have partnerships with Dell, HP and Lenovo to embed EV-DO chips in their laptops. We also recently launched the Windows Mobile Treo device. Customers are snapping up these products because of the growing set of multimedia applications that can be delivered to a mobile device. Verizon Wireless is leading this wave, as well. We continue to see strong growth in V CAST and our just-launched V CAST music service has gotten rave reviews. V CAST music is unique. It is the most comprehensive mobile music service in the world. You can download full songs over-the-air to your handset and your Windows PC and you can transfer your existing collection of music downloads and CDs to your phone. The exciting thing is that we're really just at the beginning of the wireless broadband revolution. And we have the network and the products to really take advantage of this growth trend. Of course, growth is only part of the Verizon Wireless story. We focus on profits and growth, not one or the other, but both. And you can see on slide 12 that's what we delivered in had the fourth quarter. We continue to grow with increasing profitability as our operating income margin expanded to a record 25.8% for the quarter. Quarterly EBITDA margins were 46.8%, up 36% year-on-year with a run rate of over 3 billion in each of the last three quarters. This is the best in the industry. Our already-low cash expense per subscriber hit its lowest level ever. And all of this, while we increased retail gross adds, very impressive. Our low cost structure is the result of many efficiencies in the business, as well as our very balanced distribution mix. As you can see on slide 13, we have excellent cost metrics across the board. One key element is our superior distribution network, which saw 69% of our retail post-paid gross adds coming in through our direct channels in the quarter. Acquisition cost declined by 18.6%. Network costs continued to decline. Expenses per minute of use are down nearly 18%. We continue to drive customers to the most efficient means of doing business with us. The number of self-service transactions increased nearly 48% over the past year. Employee productivity increased by almost 5% as our focus on efficiency and quality in our call centers is paying off. When you're able to increase quality and decrease costs at the same time, you have the ingredients for a winning business model. Let me wrap up wireless by saying this was another record-breaking quarter in which we expect that Verizon Wireless has increased its lead as a top carrier in the industry. Verizon Wireless has size and scale and a superb management team and organization that is executing its business model. This model is built upon the fundamentals of the best network, excellent customer service and innovative products and services. As you can see from our results, the Verizon Wireless machine is hitting on all cylinders. We have built significant momentum and are generating growth and profitability. We have an extremely loyal customer base, very low churn and a very high percentage of our customers on one or two-year contracts and we've introduced lots of new products and services. We also enter this year with a significantly enhanced spectrum position. And we have a business culture that is driven to deliver continuous improvement quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. Our consistent investment has created the platform for innovations that will drive our growth. Let's move to wireline, where we are seeing continued customer growth across the broadband, enterprise and wholesale markets. The big news is in broadband, where we now have 5.1 million customers, an increase of 1.7 million customers for the year, we added 613,000 in the fourth quarter alone. Our bundle penetration ended the year at 65%, up from 55% a year ago. And Freedom for Business packages have passed the 1 million mark, up 38% since last year. Almost half of these customers are on an annual contract. In wholesale, we also saw strong demand for DS1s and DS3s, which grew by 12.5% year-over-year. All in all, we have seen steady increases in growth product penetration and we expect to see more of the same in 2006 which will help drive revenue growth in future quarters. Our emphasis on growth products is transforming the revenue mix in the consumer market. As we have said before, this makes the traditional access line metric much less important as a gauge of revenue growth than it used to be. As you see on slide 16, growth in revenue generating units, RGUs, which we introduced last quarter, track much more closely with revenue performance than do access lines. We did lose 426,000 retail access lines in the quarter, which is an improvement over the last two quarters and from the fourth quarter of last year. We believe that the increase in broadband subscribers, the introduction of Freedom Essentials and other marketing activities help retain and win back customers. As a matter of fact, the fourth quarter marks the first time that our broadband net adds exceeded the decline in retail residential access lines. With regard to retail business line losses, we continue to see improvements over last year, especially when we exclude dial-up port disconnects as these contracts expire. Total wholesale voice connections, both UNE-P and retail declined by 323,000 during the quarter. So, overall, the increasing use of broadband connections by our customer base is redefining the traditional view of the wireline business and creating new opportunities. Looking at wireline revenue trends, we did see increasing competition and technology substitution in 2005. We are responding in the marketplace with our broadband initiatives, new products and services, increased use of bundling and some pricing changes. As you can see, we were able to maintain a stable revenue base of about 9.4 billion each quarter. Although revenues were essentially flat on a sequential basis, fourth quarter revenues were down 1.8% year-on-year and full-year revenues were down 1.1%. Among the reasons, which contributed to the fourth quarter and full year decline are the loss of revenues from discontinued activities. In the fourth quarter of 2005, this amounted to 127 million decrease over fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year, this represented a decline of 269 million. A large part of this decrease is from the termination of a large logistics management contract this past summer. You can expect about 80 to 100 million unfavorable effect in each of the next two quarters as a result of this issue. Another factor adversely affecting the fourth quarter comparison were revenues from our CPE business, which were lower than last year. In previous years, we saw CPE sales spike up in the fourth quarter but that did not occur this year. In the consumer market, fourth quarter revenues were down on a sequential basis and 1.1% year-over-year. For the full year, consumer revenues, which totaled 15.2 billion in 2005, were down only .4%. As I said earlier, this shows that we are mitigating the loss of revenue from access lines, with broadband, long distance and other services. In the fourth quarter, average monthly revenue per customer was $51.50, up 3.9% year-over-year. Wholesale revenues increased by 33 million or 1.6% on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, revenues were essentially flat. This market includes switched access, local wholesale products like UNE-P and retail. It also includes high speed, high capacity growth products, which are driving data growth in this market. I would mention that we now have 92% of our base of UNE-P customers on commercial agreements. We are scheduled to see some UNE-P price increases in 2006, which should provide an incremental margin opportunity. Looking at business, revenues in the business market were 2.75 billion, down slightly on a sequential basis and down 126 million or 4.4% versus fourth quarter last year. As I mentioned before, our CPE business was part of the reason for this decline. In the highly-competitive small and medium-size business market, we have had success in retaining customers and have been actively marketing our Verizon Freedom for Business as well as DSL. Within the enterprise space, we are obviously looking forward to the upside opportunities now that the MCI merger has closed. More on this in a few minutes. Quarterly data revenues continue to grow, increasing 9% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for high capacity and broadband products. Data transport drove most of the quarterly growth with 9.7% higher revenue than last year. For the full year, data revenues totaled 8.5 billion, an increase of 10.5%. Importantly, data is also becoming a more significant percentage of our overall wireline revenues, now standing at 23.4%. Between our data products for business and the growing popularity of our consumer broadband products, we are well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing expansion of the market for high-speed, high-capacity services. Now let's move to FiOS. We continue to see a strong and growing customer response to our FiOS data and video product offerings. Looking at the penetration rates for FiOS data, we are ahead of plan. We are seeing good customer acceptance and consistent monthly penetration gains. Last quarter, we told you that in the 35 markets where we have been actively marketing in for six months or more, average penetration was 12.4%. I want to give you an update, but in a slightly different and better way to look at our progress. In markets where we have been selling FiOS data for at least six months, the average penetration at the six-month mark for each was 9.2%. At this point, this includes more than 90 central offices. In markets where we have been selling FiOS data for at least nine months, the average penetration at the nine-month mark for each was 14%. At this point, this includes more than 35 central offices. These markets are spread throughout our footprint and compete with all the major cable players. These early penetration rates indicate that we are well on our way to achieving our goal of 30% penetration in five years. In video, we are seeing great initial acceptance by customers. In Keller, Texas, our first video market, we have already achieved 21% penetration in only four months. Within the last few months, we also began selling FiOS TV in some other Texas markets as well as Temple Terrace in Florida and Herndon, Virginia. While it's a bit early to give you penetration rates, we are very pleased with our initial sales and just this week, we launched video in Massapequa Park, New York and Woburn, Mass. We will also be selling services in a California market very shortly. As we move forward, we expect to continually enhance our video product and differentiate it even more with converged capabilities. So, we're off to a strong start. From a deployment standpoint, by the end of 2006, we expect to have passed a cumulative total of 6 million premises or about 20% of our households. Going forward, we expect to pass about 3 million per year. As we gain scale and connections, we will also be able to drive more costs out of the business and we also expect that technology improvement will further drive down our network costs, as well. Moving to our wireline margin, operating income margin, excluding pension and OPEB was 16.1% for 2005. In fact, we're targeting about a 16% margin for 2006. Of course, we normally see some variability in operating margins on a quarterly basis. The fourth quarter difference was largely driven by our very high growth in DSL and FiOS deployment. I would mention that as we gain scale in DSL, we have turned the corner on EBITDA profitability, which should continue to improve and help margins going forward. Quarterly cash expenses were up 2.6% year-over-year. We continue to see significant opportunities for additional cost savings. We have many new cost initiatives, which I'll discuss in a minute, which will help stabilize telecom margin performance. As you would expect, we continue to be focused on improving the wireline cost base. We closely manage our force levels, balancing them with our work volumes, shifting manpower whenever possible to support the fiber initiative. Our overall wireline head count ended the year at 141,000. We are also replicating the success achieved by our Partner Solutions Group, which significantly automated wholesale orders and reduced head count and costs. Over time with higher in the fourth quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. This was a result of us having to shift manpower to deal with the inordinately high damage and repair caused by the heavy rains, mainly in the month of October. Online bill payments are up 16% as we continue to drive customers to more efficient transaction-based services and we see further opportunities for savings in the areas of real estate and call center management. So to sum up wireline, we are rapidly transforming this business around the customer's growing demand for broadband. We are investing in broadband capacity in our access network, developing differentiated broadband products across all segments of the market and creating new revenue opportunities in markets such as video. You see this strategy taking hold in the fourth quarter with our record-setting performance in DSL, strong performance in data and our earlier success with FiOS. In the meantime, we're holding our ground with steady revenues, stable margins and a relentless focus on costs. We're confident in our strong wireline business model. And our network will give us an unsurpassed strategic and product platform for growth in the broadband era. I want to spend a few minutes sharing some information about our new business unit called Verizon Business, created by the acquisition of MCI. We believe this acquisition provides us with a great opportunity to further strengthen the power of the unified Verizon brand, particularly now that we can add wireless services to the product portfolio. We have an experienced management team in place with great leaders from wireline, Verizon Wireless and MCI. We have challenged these seasoned professionals with some very aggressive integration plans and some aggressive financial targets. We have a lot of experience in mergers and acquisitions, both wireless and wireline, and I'm very confident in our ability to achieve the synergies. On slide 24, you see these synergy targets by year. These run rates are about 10% higher than we originally announced, primarily from realizing these savings earlier than originally forecast. The net present value of the synergies has increased from 7 to 8 billion. Network savings represent nearly half of the total, with workforce reductions and IT savings each representing about 20% of the totals we estimate at this time. One significant area for savings in the network category is third party access savings, that is, bringing more traffic on net. These savings will be realized through a combination of moving more Verizon Wireless traffic on net as well as moving our out of footprint access and long haul LD traffic to the former MCI network. In 2006, we expect these savings across Verizon to be well over 200 million. In the area of workforce reductions, we anticipate achieving a workforce reduction of about 7,000 people within a three-year period. More than half of this reduction will be from eliminating duplicate corporate staff and from the mass market business area. In the IT and systems integration area, we also see significant opportunities. As far as the transition costs needed to capture these synergies, you can see our estimated annual spread of these costs on the slides. In total, we expect to spend about 1 billion over the next three years. Integration capital spending is estimated to be between 1.6 and 1.9 billion over the same three-year period. We estimate about 550 million of that will be spent in 2006. We have an aggressive go-to-market plan that will introduce the new Verizon Business to the marketplace. We hope to immediately enhance the customer experience with a more integrated approach to the sale of our wireless products. You can expect us to build upon Verizon and MCI's reputation for excellent service by transforming the service experience for our customers. We have a unique approach to business service delivery, called \"Customer Service Surround\". Our unique brand sales office structure places our account teams closer to our customers. Similarly, the Verizon Business Customer portal will put online service and account management tools at our customer's fingertips. From at your side support to online self-service and all points in between, our objective is to deliver an unmatched customer experience, geared to a customer's personal preferences. This will be a major element of the Verizon Business difference. And I want to emphasize that we see huge opportunities for margin improvement Verizon Business. As we look across all three network businesses, we continue to see significant cost savings opportunities over the next several years. Verizon Services, our recently created organization to provide back office and support services across our businesses, is an example of how we intend to increase efficiencies through economies of scale and reduce duplication of efforts. We are also conducting an extensive review of our expansive real estate portfolio. We are convinced that we can capture savings and unlock value through this portfolio rationalization. Web-based customer self-service applications are also examples of ways we can increase the efficiency of our business. Our network investments are intended to grow revenues and significantly reduce maintenance and operating costs. Our fiber build is a perfect example of this. Our innovative and competitively priced products and services are increasing customer retention and helping to reduce the cost of churn. As we strive to stimulate revenue growth in all of our businesses, you can expect us to continue our relentless focus on reducing our cost structure. Let me give you a couple of thoughts about how we're looking at 2006. As I said at the beginning of today's discussion, we are entering 2006 with excellent momentum. Our strategies are taking hold and customers are responding to our wireless and broadband products and services at record-setting levels, helping to diversify our revenue profile. These customer successes will continue to drive revenue growth in 2006. Our capital investments also enable growth. The investments in our network will result in market share gains and revenue growth. In addition, the resulting increase scale helps improve margins, earnings and return on invested capital. We previously stated that capital spending in 2006, excluding MCI, would be between 15.4 and 15.7 billion. With MCI, all-in capital spending is expected to be between 17 billion and 17.4 billion. The 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion incremental spending as a result of MCI, includes about 550 million of integration capital in 2006. With the MCI merger now complete, more experience with fiber and our EV-DO plans on track, we have a high degree of confidence in the stability of our 2006 capital program. From a total telecom capital spending perspective, we see 2006 as the peak expenditure level. We are very focused on maintaining stability in our margin as we grow the business. This morning, I have shared with you some of the cost-saving opportunities we see. Related to 2006 costs, let me give you a sense for net pension and OPEB expenses. As I noted earlier, net pension OPEB costs resulted in an unfavorable EPS impact of $0.30 in 2005. In 2006, we expect this total to be about $0.04 to $0.06 worse or $0.34 to $ 0.36 in total. As you know, we've taken steps to control future post-employment costs through changes in our management plan. As far as CFFO, we see improving cash flows, which will fund future investments in our networks and return value to shareowners. We have set specific goals and targets for our three network businesses. All of these are focused on growth, both top and bottom line, and creating value for shareowners. Lastly, this past December, we announced our plans to divest our Verizon Information Services Directories business. We are moving full steam ahead with our bankers. We are well along in developing the necessary planning to successfully accomplish this disposition in 2006. We will provide you more information on this value-creating transaction when our exact plans become more definitive. Thanks, Ron and I will turn it back to you.\nRon Lataille, SVP, IR: Thanks Doreen. Operator we're now ready to take some questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator:\nOperator Instructions:\nQ - David Barden: Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on a couple of topics, first on the wireless side obviously and typically what's usually a lower margin fourth quarter, there was a big step down in CPGA, a big step down in cash costs per user. If we look ahead in '06, I was wondering if you could address some of those sustainability issues on those forces as we kind of look for where margins might wind up in the coming year. The second issue would be on the FiOS metrics that are coming out. Could you talk a little bit about whether those are being driven by conversions of existing subscribers in DSL or competitive winbacks? And then maybe the last issue would be on the directory spin. You know, whatever, how it happens, there's going to be probably incremental borrowing capacity or cash coming into the parent company. Any early thoughts on what the intentions are to do with that incremental flexibility? Thanks a lot.\nA - Doreen Toben: Hey, David thanks. If I start with, I guess the first question on wireless margins. I guess what I would say is we target wireless margins in the, you know, sort of mid to low 40s. That would be normal. To the extent that you didn't have the kind of growth, you know, you might actually kick it up a little bit. But I would think about the fact that we think there's lots more opportunity out there, there's a lot more at only 70% penetration, we think there's a lot more opportunity to grow, but the target sort of, you know, mid to low 40s. On your the metrics, I guess, for fiber, I guess the, the conversion rate from DSL is around 35%. Was there more with the DSL? That was it for DSL. Okay. And then Ivan, do you want to do the\u2026\nA - Ivan Seidenberg: Yeah, David, on the question of use of cash with the directory divestiture, the way we think about this is, as Doreen pointed out in her opening remarks, we feel pretty good about the visibility of our -- of our spending this year, where we're going to put our capital. So, we don't see the issue of the use of cash from the directory as impacting the run rate of what we would do with organic investments in the, in all three businesses, Wireless and Verizon Business as well as the Telco. Now, once we get a little further along into the year and we look at the form of the actual divestiture, our first focus there is to try to figure out a way to return value to shareholders using that cash. And as Doreen has talked about in the past, there are options to do lots of things, which is balance sheet improvement, reduce debt, buyback shares. So we'll, as this unfolds during the year, we'll -- we'll take a careful look at that.\nQ - David Barden: Thanks, guys.\nA - Ron Lataille: Operator, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nA - Doreen Toben: Okay, thanks. Good morning.\nQ - John Hodulik: Hi. A couple of questions, first on the wireline margins, you had said in the past that FiOS would, would create dilution of about $0.14 in '05. Can you update us on that, on how that, how that turned out here in the fourth quarter? And then looking out into, into '06, we got the 16% EBIT premargin or prepension margin guidance. What kind of dilution from FiOS and potentially from the, you know, video rollouts are included in that number? And then just real quick follow-up on the DSL growth, is this kind of you know similar to David's question on wireless, is this a sustainable number? Is it being driven by the $15 plan? And how much, you know, if you can maybe in round numbers, are you getting a nice kick from FiOS, as well?\nA - Doreen Toben: Okay, I think on the FiOS question, it was $0.04 in the third quarter, it kicked up to $0.05 in the, in the fourth quarter. So, that was the incremental dilution. I think I did say, you know, in the text, that in '06, we sort of expect a $0.10 to, you know, $0.15 additional dilution on top of that. A lot of it based on success base, so that's sort of why the range. Yeah, that would be already built into the 16% target that we're, that we've talked about. On the DSL, I think, you know, about 50% of the net adds are coming from you know, from the 1495. However, very, very, very low migration, which is, which is something that's good. The people are really staying with their existing higher speeds. And as far as the ability to kick up, I mean the penetration of broadband is still very low, you know, in the country at 35%. So, we do think that there's a lot more opportunity, you know, we still have all the dialup guys converting, that's a lot of what's happening with the 1495. So, we think that there is still a lot more opportunity on broadband into '06.\nQ - John Hodulik: Okay, great. Thanks.\nA - Doreen Toben: Okay.\nA - Ron Lataille: Thank you, John, operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Viktor Shvets of Deutsche Banc. Please go ahead with your question.\nQ - Viktor Shvets: Yes, good morning, everybody. Thank you very much. Just looking at the dilution from media products, just following in from John's comment, how should we think about programming cost as well as subscriber position costs in 2006? You've launched a number of media markets this year and you're going to launch further as we go through 2006. What kind of operational expenses should we reporting into our models? And how media expenses and SAK are going to be amortized through the P&L? Thank you.\nA - Doreen Toben: Okay, hi, Viktor. Let's make sure I understand your question. The $0.10 to $0.15 obviously has the video piece in it. I would suggest that it probably ramps during the year, you know, as you start to have more success base, if you're thinking about how it spreads, right, you're going to, you're going to ramp it up through the end of the year. And on, as far as the, you're asking like what we're capitalizing and what we're expensing piece of it? On the video piece, I guess it's really mostly capital.\nQ - Viktor Shvets: Right, so, you'll be, you'll be, you'll be capitalizing and then amortizing over a number of years, is it?\nA - Doreen Toben: Yes and I guess different pieces would have different lives to, you know, what we're, what we're amortizing in.\nQ - Viktor Shvets: Okay. Thank you.\nA - Ron Lataille: Thanks, Viktor. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you, your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nQ - Simon Flannery: Okay, thanks very much. Good morning. Ivan, there's been a lot of talk out of Europe about Vodafone being pressured to sell their stake in Verizon Wireless. Can you just talk about whether that's something you would still like to do and whether do you think there might be some more opportunity this year? And secondly, can you talk about the regulatory environment around video franchising? Any sort of movement in Washington or in the states, to try to get that moving along more quickly? Thanks.\nA - Ivan Seidenberg: Yeah, on the Vodafone question, like everyone else, we were very interested in what we read and heard about the, the Vodafone earnings call. Our position has pretty much been the same all along and maybe I, and there, I take a moment to clarify where we are in this. First of all, we've had no direct indication from Vodafone that they've changed their position. So, we're as anxious as anyone else is to see how the, the conversation that started the other day materializes. To the extent, however, that there is a change of a view coming from Vodafone, we clearly would be interested in increasing ownership of Verizon Wireless, whether in stages or actually acquiring 100% of it. I would add that we also recognize that the put option is not the preferred vehicle for Vodafone to facilitate any transaction. That was exactly the issue we had when they were considering the purchase of AWE. So, so, Simon, we are very open and willing to consider negotiation around that to make sure that it's efficient for both sides and it's, we can maximize value for both parties. You know, when you think about it, Verizon Wireless has gone through an extraordinary run here. It's, it's created a lot of value for both sides. And that I think that it's a good time to think about this and so we would stand ready to work on that. One other point that, that I would make is that, as we think about this, just so that Verizon shareholders would understand how we think about this, Doreen and I have, have talked about this, and our view is to the extent possible, we would try to do anything here if it was, if it was given to us by Vodafone, with as much cash as possible. And so, for example, like everybody understands, the Omnitel ownership, perhaps the, the divestiture of VIS would all be, be part of how we would think about funding, funding the whole operation. So, I think we need to give Vodafone some room to think through what they want to do. But our position, Simon, has been what it's always been. If the opportunity came to be, we would be, we would stand ready to work with them.\nQ - Simon Flannery: Good and on the video franchising?\nA - Ivan Seidenberg: Yeah, on that we feel that we're making good progress here. We got a few more franchises working. We\u2019ve got plans for several hundred more to file. There've been a couple of breakthroughs in several states, in which legislatures have taken votes on it. We even have one state, believe it or not, where the, where the local cable association has taken a positive position on, on where we are. So, I think, Simon, the way we see this, is we're going to continue the, the sort of community by community approach that we've started. But we feel we are getting traction in several states. We're taking a look at the broader picture. I'm sure you know that next week there's a hearing in Washington on this subject. So, I think there's a lot of momentum building, and we're taking the position we're going to do this step by step, but also look for the sort of broader policy opportunity and we feel that the, the stars are lining up for public officials to take a more aggressive stance on this over the next several months.\nQ - Simon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nA - Ron Lataille: Thanks, Simon. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Thank your next question is from Jeff Halpern of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.\nQ - Jeff Halpern: Good morning, guys. Ivan, if I could just follow up, two questions, if I could follow up on your answer to Simon's question just now. I was wondering if you have any sense of what the difference in timing looks like between a state level approval process for franchising versus a municipal, municipality by municipality one? And then, Doreen, is there any way you can give us a similar kind of update as you did last quarter on where we are on things like operating expense savings and capital savings that you're seeing in markets that have had FiOS for six or nine months or longer?\nA - Ivan Seidenberg: Yes, quickly, I don't think there's a big issue associated with timing. I don't think there's, by the way, any story there. I think that the law is the law. I think we have to go out and get, and get franchise approvals and we're doing that and we're doing it aggressively. And we're queued up. We don't feel that there's any impediment to our rolling out FiOS during the year, 2006. Admittedly as we go into two seven and '08, we'll need to be more aggressive because we'll be in more communities. But by that time, I'm sure we will have so much success with, with the early deployment, that the whole political environment starts to, to change as we go forward. We've already seen that. And as I, we've said before, every place where we, we instigate a vote, the vote usually comes out, you know, let's, let's create competition in this, in this marketplace. So, we do have some, some things in the regulatory process we need to work through, but I don't think there's any, any timing issue that we have to face anytime in 2006.\nQ - Jeff Halpern: Great.\nA - Doreen Toben: Okay, and Jeff, on the operation, operation savings or on the capitol savings, I think at this point, the scale, the amount of how homes that we really have connected, it's really to small to have, you know, to have a lot of data. What we get is antidotal at this point. So, it is, it is, we do track, say when there's weather-related, you can see that the trouble reports from those, those homes, you know, don't vary at all. But as far as, you know, being able to say it's \"X\" amount of dollars at this point, I think we need, you know, some more time and some more scale before we can really get our hands on that definitively.\nQ - Jeff Halpern: Okay, thanks.\nA - Ron Lataille: Thanks, Jeff. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from David Janazzo of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nQ - David Janazzo: Good morning. Doreen, you had talked about workforce and, of course, with, with MCI you'll have about 250,000 employees, and you had mentioned 7,000 over, over a three-year period. Can you comment a bit on, on the overall strategy of, of head count management?\nA - Doreen Toben: In all well, in the different units if I starting like with wireless, in wireless, I think what we've seen is, you know, you'll see increases because of its growth, plus we've had different strategies in wireless, where we're actually putting people in stores. So, to the extent that you're actually putting a store within a store, you're actually growing your head count. If I move over to the Telco, they will have, you know, some reduction level this year and part of it will be, you know, a straight reduction. The other piece is, you know, they're going to move some people really on to the FiOS plan. So, they have a fairly significant number that they're going down. But some of it is, in fact, a shift from the base into capital. And the 7,000 that we talked about, a lot of it, very heavily front-end loaded of that 7,000 over the first two years. So, you'll see a substantial number going down, a lot in the mass markets initially. Okay?\nQ - David Janazzo: And then in terms of the Telco, you mentioned a reduction level in, in '06 any further clarification on that?\nA - Doreen Toben: No, at this time I'm not going to give you a number.\nQ - David Janazzo: Okay. Thank you.\nA - Doreen Toben: Okay.\nA - Ron Lataille: Thanks Dave. Operator, now I'd like to turn the call over to Ivan Seidenberg for some concluding comments.\nIvan Seidenberg, Chairman, CEO: Okay, just a couple of thoughts here. Hopefully as, as investors and owners look at our Company this quarter, there's a couple of things that, that we would like you to consider as you do your analysis and you look out into the future about us. First of all, hopefully you see that, or as Doreen said, our strategies are taking root, we're gaining some momentum. There is a greater shift of our overall top line focused on the growth markets. You can see that in all of the markets that we have significant opportunities. Our Telco is gaining customers. We recognize we need to convert the investments in FiOS and DSL and LD into bottom line results and we're anxious to, to prove that. The VZ Business to us, that is a bottom line story of getting synergies out and generating improvements in, in cash year-over-year. The wireless story speaks for itself. It's both the top and the bottom line story and it's one of raising the bar and widening the lead. But while that's happening, hopefully that, that everyone sees that wireless looks at the market as having more unlimited opportunities, rather than a closing, a ceiling on it. There's plenty of growth available for us, and with the kind of engine that our team has built, we're in good shape. There's always a lot of discussion about returning value to shareholders. The only comment that I would like to make on that is, that as we finish 2005, we took steps with our pension for management. We, we just took a step, last month, to increase our share buyback capability from 80 million to 100 million shares. We have focused on the divestiture of VIS and the quick go-to-market for the MCI combination. So, we feel we're in a better position, as we move into 2006, by executing on our plan, showing that we have good solid results and good, good operating focus. But at the same time, the Company will have increased flexibility to deal with how we return value to shareholders during the year. The, the new starter this week, as we were preparing for this call, obviously the new interest and perhaps acquiring a greater ownership share in Vodafone. While there's still a lot of work to be done and we have to be sure we, we know where Vodafone comes out, that's another opportunity that, if it came to us, we would be more than delighted to, to go forward. So, with that, we feel like we had a good quarter. And that we're poised to continue the momentum into 2006. Thanks.\nRon Lataille, SVP, IR: Thank you, everybody. For joining our call. And have a good day."}], "2007": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2006, "date": "2007-01-29 12:41:12", "content": "TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nExecutives: Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations   Doreen A.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.  (Operator Instructions)  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon. \nRon Lataille : Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2006 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and CEO; Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which area available on our website.  This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.  Earlier this month, we filed an 8-K with the SEC, reclassifying previously reported historical information related to our directory business into income from discontinued operations. As you know, this was due to the Idearc spin-off transaction. As a reminder, income from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter will include about six weeks of Idearc results, two months of Dominicana, and a full quarter of Puerto Rico.  In the first quarter 2007, and until the sale closes, income from Puerto Rico will continue to be included in this line item.  Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I\u2019d like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.35. Adjusted earnings, or EPS before the effects of special items, were $0.62. This quarter, there are five special items which we are excluding from adjusted results.  The largest item is a $541 million after-tax charge, which is $0.19 per share, related to our sale of Verizon Dominicana. The sale of our Dominicana property resulted in a pre-tax book gain of about $3 million. Offsetting this gain were $571 million of taxes recognized upon the sale per APB 23. As we previously disclosed, our net cash after-tax proceeds from this transaction were about $1.7 billion.  The next non-recurring item is a $101 million, or $0.03 per share charge for costs related to the spin-off of Idearc, mainly fees related to banking, legal, auditing and other administrative costs. As you will recall, the spin-off also generated $9 billion in cash and reduced debt.  The last three items we are excluding from adjusted results are: $55 million in after-tax charges, or $0.02 per share, related to severance and related pension and benefit costs; $47 million after tax, or $0.02 per share, for merger integration costs; and $30 million after tax, or $0.01 per share, for relocation and other costs related to our move to Verizon Center.  You should also note that we do not exclude the effects of amortization of intangibles from our adjusted results. For the full year, amortization expense related to MCI customer lists was $190 million pre-tax, or about $0.04 per share.  In summary, adjusted earnings were $0.62 for the fourth quarter and $2.54 for the full year. EPS from continuing operations -- that is, excluding income from Idearc, Dominicana and Puerto Rico, were $0.52 for the fourth quarter and $2.06 for the full year.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. \nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nWhat if there was a way to promote your company to a perfectly targeted group of potential customers, partners, acquirers and investors?

Before I get into our fourth quarter results, I would like to review some of the highlights of 2006, including the progress we made in a number of strategic areas.  As you know, we strongly believe that our strategic networks are the foundation of our business model. The Verizon wireless network has long been the undisputed quality leader, and it continues to deliver industry-leading operating and financial results.  In 2006, Verizon Wireless added more customers than any year in our history -- 7.7 million net adds. We continue to focus on the high quality retail market. We now have a customer base of more than 59 million, 96% of which are retail. And in the face of intense competition, we expanded ARPU and increased customer loyalty.  We made significant progress in our broadband transformation. We passed more than 3 million additional homes with our high-capacity fiber network, doubling the amount of premises pass. We also doubled the number of homes open for sale.  While making these significant strides in deployment, we also reduced the unit cost to both pass and connect homes. We also successfully created a new video business from scratch, including new network facilities, the acquisition of content, and obtained over 600 franchises, covering 7.3 million households. We ended the year exceeding our subscriber expectations with more than 200,000 video customers, and we expect video to gain even more momentum in 2007.  In the enterprise business market, the MCI merger gives us an unsurpassed local to global network and the ability to offer advanced services to the business customers around the world. We successfully integrated and stabilized the MCI business.  We introduced more financial discipline into the customer acquisition process, and we have successfully restored revenue growth, posting both year over year and sequential growth in the fourth quarter.  Our focus on investment and innovation is also positioning us to deliver additional value to shareowners as well as customers. During the course of the year, we strengthened our balance sheet and returned value to shareowners through the spin-off of Verizon Information Services, now Idearc, and the sale of our investment in the Dominican Republic.  We repurchased $1.7 billion of stock in 2006, and as we have previously said, we plan to recommend to our board that it maintain the annual dividend at $1.62 per share post Idearc spin. Since Idearc intends to pay a dividend, Verizon shareowners that hold Idearc shares have the opportunity to, in effect, get a dividend increase.  So as I look at 2006, we have become a more innovative, competitive, global and high-tech company. We\u2019re even more focused on our network-based, organic growth strategies and more unified in how we approach our customers. We also remain focused on profitable growth and creating shareowner value.  Okay, let\u2019s turn to slide 4 and look at some of the details.  Pro forma consolidated revenue growth was 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the full year. Revenues have grown sequentially each quarter this year, and about 60% of our annual growth of $2.8 billion occurred in the second-half of the year, which demonstrates the positive momentum we are building. As you\u2019ll see, revenue increases this quarter were once again driven by wireless, broadband, and enterprise data services.  Operating income increased for both the fourth quarter and for the full year. In fact, in 2006, revenue growth was more than $1 billion greater than the increase in cash expenses, leading to 10% growth in operating income and 100 basis point expansion in the operating income margin. So strong momentum as we enter 2007.  We ended the year with very solid cash flow results and a much stronger balance sheet. For the full year, cash from continuing operations totaled $23 billion, a 12.6% or $2.6 billion increase over 2005. Total capital spending came in at $17.1 billion, which is within the guidance range we provided in early 2006.  Our cap-ex to revenue ratio for 2006 was 19.4%. The year-over-year cap-ex increase is primarily attributable to adding MCI, which represented about $1.6 billion of the increase. The rest is from continued investments in wireless and broadband growth initiatives.  Debt was $36.4 billion at the end of the year, and while this is down almost $2 billion from last year, keep in mind that the debt assumed in the MCI acquisition was not part of the 2005 year-end number. At the end of January after the MCI transaction, we had $41.9 billion of net debt. So in effect, we reduced net debt by almost $9 billion since the MCI transaction.  Let\u2019s now turn to wireless, starting with some operational highlights. 2006 marked another year in which we sustained our growth by differentiating ourselves. We effectively and seamlessly increased network capacity to handle significant customer growth and, at the same time, maintain the reliability of our network. We expanded our wireless broadband capabilities, extending high-speed EVDO coverage by about 50 million pops, and also began our EVDO Rev-A deployment, which we will continue throughout 2007.  We introduced new and innovative products and services, including:  In the next few months, we will roll our V-Cast Mobile TV.  Another big differentiator for Verizon Wireless is the quality of our customer base. We are the industry leader in terms of total number of retail customers. These are the customers who choose Verizon\u2019s branded service. Through our direct relationships with these customers, the most reliable network, product innovation and excellent customer service, we not only maintained our customer loyalty but actually improved upon our leadership position.  2006 marked another year in which Verizon Wireless gained market share and delivered industry-leading financial results, extending our overall leadership in the industry. Our financial results for the fourth quarter, as shown on slide 7, continued to reflect the strength of our business model.  Quarterly revenues surpassed the $10 billion mark in the fourth quarter, and were up strongly, both sequentially and year over year. For the year, wireless revenues grew to just over $38 billion, an impressive 17.8% growth.  The quality of our customer base, as I mentioned earlier, along with our efficient cost structure, drove margin performance once again.  EBITDA for the quarter grew 8% year over year, and nearly 20% for the full year. Full-year EBITDA, which totaled $14.5 billion, had a higher growth rate than revenue. EBITDA margins were 43.2% in the fourth quarter, and 44.3% for the year, representing 110 basis point margin expansion over full-year 2005.  Once again, our strong growth in service revenues was driven by increased data usage and significant customer growth. Fourth quarter service ARPU of $50.12 increased 1.5% year over year, by far our highest quarterly growth rate this year. As you would expect, this is primarily related to our retail customer base.  Data revenues accounted for nearly 16% of service revenue and represented $1.4 billion of revenue in the quarter. Data made up $7.91 of total service ARPU, up substantially year over year, and $0.75 sequentially.  We had an outstanding quarter of quality customer growth, with 2.3 million net adds. More than 2.2 million of these net adds were retail customers, and even more significantly, 2.1 million of these were post-paid customers. In fact, we have seen strong sequential growth in retail net adds for each of the last three quarters, driven almost entirely by new post-paid customers. For the year, our retail base increased by 7.8 million net new customers, a 15.9% increase over 2005. We now have 56.8 million retail customers.  Customer loyalty remains very strong. Quarterly churn rates improved both sequentially and year over year. In the fourth quarter, total churn was 1.14%, and retail post-paid churn was 0.89%.  Wireless data services are continuing to grow, as you see on slide 10. 34 million, or 60% of our retail customers, are now data users, up from 49% one year ago. Data revenues in 2006 doubled compared with last year, and now total $4.5 billion. Data is not only an increasing component of total revenues, it also drove about half of the total service revenue growth in 2006.  Approximately 35% of data revenue comes from business-focused applications. Revenues from our Internet access and e-mail products increased 120% year over year, and more than 50% of our data revenue growth comes from services other than messaging, primarily EVDO-based.  Looking at our priorities in wireless for 2007, we will continue to focus on our network superiority and expand our wireless broadband capabilities. EVDO Rev-A will continue to be rolled out this year and we expect to have significant coverage in all major markets in 2007. We will continue to innovate.  As we announced earlier this month, we will roll out V-Cast Mobile TV service by the end of the first quarter, in partnership with QualComm. We will also continue our focus on adding retail customers.  Finally, we are confident that we will continue to gain market share, post industry-leading financial performance, and sustain our growth leadership position in the industry.  Let\u2019s now turn to our wireline segment. As you know, our goal is to transform the telecom franchise into a broadband business, and we made significant progress in expanding our broadband capabilities in 2006. As I mentioned earlier, we doubled the amount of homes passed with fiber. We\u2019ve also doubled the number of data homes open for sale, and on the video side, we increased the number of homes open for sale from about 110,000 at the beginning of the year to about 2.4 million by the end of December.  In Verizon Business, we expanded our global IT capabilities, which gave us a particularly strong position in the high-end of the enterprise market and enabled growth in strategic services, such as IP, ethernet, and managed services.  As we expanded our broadband and business capabilities, we also focused on reducing costs and improving our competitive cost structure. For example, in 2006, the wireline segment reduced headcount by about 9200 people.  Wireline financial results, as shown on slide 13, came in as I expected. Revenues have continued to show steady improvement as year-over-year rate of decline has decreased each quarter. Fourth quarter revenues declined 3.5%, a significant improvement from the 6.8% year-over-year decline in the first quarter.  This improvement is primarily due to data revenue growth. Data revenues grew 9.5% in the fourth quarter. Data now represents nearly one-third of our total wireline revenue stream.  Fourth quarter operating income margins of 8.9% were flat compared with last year and show a modest 10 basis points sequential increase, driven by strong cost controls in the quarter. These results include FiOS earnings dilution of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.32 for the full year.  Let\u2019s take a more detailed look at some of the revenue categories. We are seeing some encouraging signs as the rate of decline in consumer retail revenues have decreased steadily since the first quarter, as our broadband products have become a more significant portion of this revenue category, about 14% this quarter.  Also encouraging is the fact that consumer ARPU of more than $53 grew 1% sequentially and nearly 4% year over year, providing evidence that our broadband initiatives are expanding our relationships with customers.  Within the regional small business market, revenues for the quarter were down about $16 million, or 1.2%. On a full-year basis, this revenue category totaled $5.2 billion and showed modest growth of about 0.2%.  As in the consumer market, data is becoming a more significant portion of this revenue stream. Small and medium business data revenues grew more than 30% in 2006 and are approaching 10% of this revenue category.  Finally, wholesale revenues, which includes special access, switched access and local wholesale, declined 3.1% in the quarter. This is due to the expected decline of UNE-Ps and also some intra-state switched access rate reductions. Again, the data portion of this revenue category, primarily special access, is continuing to grow, up nearly 6% in the fourth quarter.  Now let\u2019s look at some of the subscriber metrics, starting on slide 15. The three line items within consumer retail represent our strategic focus. As you can see, in the fourth quarter, we added 142,000 more net broadband and video customers than the decline in primary lines. This is an improvement over the third quarter when we added 120,000 more primary consumer units.  On a consumer RGU basis, which includes additional lines, we were up slightly on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. More importantly, the consumer revenue improvement was much greater.  Our FiOS subscriber metric continued to show steady growth in the fourth quarter. We also saw continued growth in FiOS Internet in the fourth quarter. We added 165,000 net new FiOS Internet subscribers, averaging more than 12,000 per week. For the full year, we added 517,000 net subscribers. We now have 687,000 FiOS Internet subs, representing 14% penetration of homes open for sale. Combined with DSL, we have 7 million total broadband customers, up 1.8 million from a year ago.  We ended the year with 207,000 FiOS TV subscribers, with 89,000 net adds in the quarter. This is an average of 6800 net new subscribers per week. We ended the year with 2.4 million homes open for sale, with an increase of 1.2 million in the fourth quarter alone.  As you know, we made a significant number of homes open for sale in late December in New Jersey, after receiving a state-wide franchise during the quarter. Almost half of the 1.2 million homes open for sale in the fourth quarter came online in the last two weeks of December. So even with this late-in-the-year increase in homes open for sale, we achieved 9% penetration in our first full year of offering video. We are seeing that six out of every 10 FiOS TV orders are also requesting FiOS Internet to be installed at the same time.  In Verizon Business, which serves global enterprise and government customers, we continue to see improvements on the demand side. We\u2019re seeing volume growth and increasing demand for bandwidth, especially in the premier enterprise customer segment. This helped drive a 27% increase in strategic services revenue in the fourth quarter and helped restore total business year-over-year revenue growth. Revenues totaled $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 2.7% year over year, with higher sequential growth in each of the last three quarters.  We believe this is a meaningful turnaround in the business. For the year, Verizon Business generated more than $20.6 billion in revenue. Strategic services exceeded $4.1 billion in 2006, and now represents 20% of total Verizon Business revenue.  Our integration efforts have also been successful. From an operational perspective, the integration of MCI generated $600 million in synergy savings in 2006, which is slightly ahead of our targeted $550 million in year one. We are increasing our 2007 synergy target from $825 million to $900 million.  Many of the incremental savings we expect in 2007 are from systems integration projects that are well underway.  Another area we will focus on in 2007 will be reducing access costs. Verizon Business continues to have lots of opportunities to grow market share and increase efficiency. Our Wireline priorities in 2007 focus on three key areas:  As I previously guided, we expect FiOS earnings dilution to be at its peak in the fourth quarter of 2006 through the first quarter of 2007. Dilution should be about $0.11 in the first quarter of this year.  Let me summarize as follows: we had a strong 2006, both operationally and financially. We gained market share and expanded customer relationships. Our organic growth initiatives are gaining momentum and have created the foundation for sustainable, long-term growth.  As far as our financial outlook, as we\u2019ve said many times, we believe our networks are and will continue to be a strategic differentiator. We plan to invest between $17.5 billion and $17.9 billion in those networks in 2007. On the Wireline side, we expect total cap-ex of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. This includes some additional capital to reduce access costs going forward and additional success-based investments related to FiOS, and growth in private IT, web hosting, and new product development.  Integration capital is expected to be higher in 2007 versus 2006, but we are still within our original guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion over three years.  In Verizon Wireless, we expect spending to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion, as we continue to add capacity and enhance our broadband capabilities.  We will also continue to increase our financial flexibility and create value for our shareowners in 2007. We recently announced a spin-off and merger of access lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, with FairPoint Communications. We are nearing the completion of the Puerto Rico telephone company sale, and as I said, we plan to continue our share buy-back program at similar levels to what we did in 2006.  With that, I will turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Ivan, Denny, and Doreen are now available to take questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions)  Your first question is from John Hodulik of UBS. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Thanks, good morning, everyone. Just a couple questions. First, I guess for Doreen, we appreciate the guidance you gave for \u201907. Is it possible for you guys to give us a little bit more direction from an earnings standpoint, or maybe even more as it relates to FiOS metrics?  Secondly, for Doreen, I thought the consumer ARPU strength was nice, and a little bit surprising, a little better than we thought. Could you give us some more trends going forward, where we go from the 4% as you guys expand the reach of FiOS?  Then, for Ivan, I thought the FairPoint spin was well-received and the price is good. Is that the kind of structure we can expect going forward, as you look at some of the other line sales?  Then, sorry to keep going like this, but while we have Denny on the line, can you give us an initial look on what your first priorities are, as you start to oversee the wireline business? \nDoreen A. Toben: I\u2019ll start. If I start with the ARPU one first, I think what you saw was almost 4% ARPU growth in the quarter. What I would tell you is December accelerated, so it was even higher than the quarterly average. We expect to see it increase significantly even next year. It\u2019s really a mix between price-ups that we\u2019ve been doing, both in December as we roll into \u201907, as well as the fact the product mix, you know, the data and the video, has really made a big difference.  I think I\u2019ve used before with you anecdotally, we\u2019re seeing at least one state now at sort of a 15% ARPU, so we\u2019re certainly encouraged in where we\u2019re seeing the ARPU. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS: It seems that the consumer business should grow nicely next year as you continue to see that accelerate. \nDoreen A. Toben: I think what you\u2019ll see is the trends from this year will certainly improve next year. If I talk you through the guidance, if you start with the $2.06, which was the recurring number, I would say if you think about there is still about $0.05 in concave A that\u2019s in there, not in discontinued ops. You should think about there\u2019s $10 billion, a little bit more than $10 billion in cash that we would earn interest on from all the deals that we did. You should think pension and OPEB as relatively flat. Pension\u2019s really a help, but the discount rate, it did move the discount rate from 575 to 6, so you think pension and OPEB as relatively flat. Kept the ROA the same, so no change there at 8.5.  I think when you come down to it, I would say we had 10% operating income growth this year. I would say that we would have at least a 10% op income growth next year. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Great, thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: John, on the FiOS dilution, we\u2019re expecting about $0.11 in the first quarter of this year. Given the take rate experience that we had in the fourth quarter, we could see dilution for the year in the mid-$0.30 range. Of course, our view is that success-based dilution is good news in the long run.  I would like all to understand that we\u2019re making some very good progress in reducing [wait] time in the home. We really do understand the key drivers. For example, we\u2019re deploying timesaving technologies, MOCA, for example. We\u2019re using software tools to help quickly configure PCs and TVs. We\u2019re also increasing productivity by doing more actually before the tech gets into the home.  I guess bottom line on the FiOS dilution is we\u2019d like you to know that we are focused on eliminating unnecessary wasted time inside the home and in preparing the home from the outside. Our outlook for cost to pass and connect has not change and we\u2019re making some very good progress. \nIvan G. Seidenberg : On the FairPoint transaction, just a couple of comments. We do like the transaction. We like the structure. We like the buyer. I would say this, here\u2019s the way we\u2019d like you to think about all these access line transactions: this was a unique one. Whole states, a good buy, a solid operator, something that when you look at the long term, there\u2019s no dispute that these three states are more rural than they are anything else. We think that FairPoint offers a way for these assets to be repositioned and continue to participate in the growth of the industry as they would manage rural assets.  As far as your question about other structures, yes, we like the Morris Trust. We\u2019d also like to take a step back now and absorb everything that we\u2019ve done, so we\u2019d like to get this FairPoint thing a little further along, complete the other transactions that we have and keep an open eye, but we\u2019re not in any rush to make any other moves, unless there\u2019s something really unique that makes a lot of sense for shareholders. \nDennis F. Strigl: John, on your question on priorities, and let me back up a second here and just say that the organizational changes that were made in December were the result of Ivan, Larry [Babio] and I talking about these changes for several months. Our feeling was that the time was right. Verizon Wireless, of course, in great shape, the transformation of the teleco to broadband well underway, and our Verizon business integration successful in \u201906, and we feel very good about that in \u201907.  So to your question, the priority or the goals for this year are to increase our focus on growth, organic growth, of course, in particular, to increase our rate of growth; that is, increasing product innovation and speed to market and also, of course, to enhance customer service and to continue to improve our cost structure throughout 2007. This is not only the priorities that I have but this is shared by each of the individuals who run our groups; telecom, wireless, business, and also Verizon Services we think will give us a great advantage this year in realizing economies of scale and helping us improve our cost structure.  Another focus with our new organization is for introducing services and bundled announcements that leverage our assets across all of our groups. In fact, you will see tomorrow that we will make the first of many announcements in which we will bundle wireless into our consumer plan. So stay tuned for that tomorrow. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Great, thank you. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from David Barden of Banc of America. \nDavid Barden - Banc of America: Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll try to keep it to two. The first would be just on the business side, obviously some strong growth in the enterprise. If you could talk about the forces at work there, you know, the mix of point of sale pricing versus technology price downs versus contract re-pricings and how that trend looks into 2007, and you know, in this fourth quarter, if anything in there is CPE type of sales.  Then, the second question, maybe just Denny, kind of drawing on some of your experience. Obviously very strong growth this year in wireless, especially in the fourth quarter. Some competitors are grappling with some internal questions. They\u2019re going to try to get back on their feet by the second-half of the year, focusing on handsets. Cingular is going to be trying to bring their iPhone product to the market, again another marquee handset. One criticism for Verizon, not that you see it in the numbers, but it\u2019s been that the handset mix has been moderate relative to competitors. As this becomes a new focus, what is Verizon Wireless\u2019 game plan for staying strong in the second-half of \u201907 as the wireless competitors try to bring new stuff to market? Thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: David, a wide range of questions, and let me start on the business side. In pricing, we\u2019ve experienced a moderate stabilization in 2006, particularly in our legacy products. We have sales of our next generation services, such as private IP, are doing very well, and we\u2019re seeing an increased response from our competitors in that regard.  But our focus continues to be on profitable revenue growth. CPE, our focus this year is more, as CPE being an add-on to what we sell. On the revenue growth outlook for business, the trends are good and we saw sequential revenue growth, as you heard from Doreen, throughout 2006. We\u2019re looking forward to overall business market trends that put us into a good position for growth in \u201907.  We expect continued year over year total Verizon business revenue growth, particularly focusing on IT and professional services that we\u2019re able to bring to the marketplace.  On the wireless question, let me start with the iPhone. That\u2019s probably the most popular question these days. If you all have seen the USA Today article that Leslie Cauley wrote, our take is that she was right on. The iPhone market, the iPhone product is something where, quite frankly, we\u2019re happy that we\u2019re not first to market with the iPhone.  We think that innovation and a focus on music will benefit the whole industry. It really does draw attention to our data capabilities. You heard from Doreen that that\u2019s a very strong market for us, but bottom line on the iPhone, I think we\u2019re -- many are interested in comparing a future offering with what we have in the marketplace today: it\u2019s like comparing apples and oranges.  I will tell you that we will stay competitive and more on that as the year rolls out.  Looking at the product line that we have, particularly the handset lineup, we\u2019re very confident with our strategic partners and we\u2019ve had a lot of good product from all three of our major suppliers, and there too, more on that as the year rolls out. \nDavid Barden - Banc of America: All right, thanks. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tim Horan of CIBC. \nTimothy Horan - CIBC World Markets: Good morning, guys. One clarification and one question. Doreen, does the cap-ex guidance include set-top box cap-ex? \nDoreen A. Toben: Yes, Tim. \nTimothy Horan - CIBC World Markets: Great. Then, on the wireless side, Denny, you had a really strong quarter here. It seems like some of your competitors are kind of injured out there. Would your preference be to go out and continue to gain market share and maybe keep margins kind of flattish where they\u2019re at now? Or do you think you can continue to expand margins at the rate that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years going forward? Thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: Our margin outlook continues, Tim, to be the same. We expect margins in the 43% to 45% range, so no change from the previous guidance that you\u2019ve had from us.  In terms of perhaps slowing down growth, if that was your indication there, we have no intentions of slowing down growth. Our goal is to continue to take share as we have quarter after quarter. We\u2019ll do that by also focusing on profitability. We\u2019ve done both quarter after quarter, grown the base and been profitable in the 43% to 45% range. \nTimothy Horan - CIBC World Markets: Thank you. \nDennis F. Strigl: Just an add-on to that, Tim. We\u2019re pleased with the local member portability results that we\u2019ve had. We take in two customers for every one that we hand over to our competitors, so good result there. \nTimothy Horan - CIBC World Markets: Have you seen any slowdown in that metric? \nDennis F. Strigl: We have not. It\u2019s been essentially the same. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. \nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Good morning. A couple of FiOS questions. First, on FiOS TV, about 40% of the homes you\u2019ve built passed. That\u2019s starting to accelerate. How should we think about that for \u201907 as you go to 9 million homes passed? Are you going to be able to keep that 40%, grow it to 50% or 60%?  Secondly, in the past, you\u2019ve given us penetration numbers for markets that have been open six, nine months or whatever. Can you give us a feel for where we are in places like Keller where you\u2019ve really been able to have a good time in the marketplace with the product? Thanks. \nDoreen A. Toben: I\u2019ll start with the first part. Keller is, I\u2019m looking around to see if I should give the number. Texas is probably well over 20%, 22%, 25%, Texas all by itself. Keller is very, very high.  We stopped giving the six, nine and twelve because we\u2019re giving you in total and because we have so many different COs that start to roll into that, so we though by giving you the total penetration, it was probably more effective.  Off the top of my head, I actually don\u2019t know the first part of the question on \u201907. \nIvan G. Seidenberg : I can help, maybe, but maybe Simon, we don\u2019t understand the frame of the question. We\u2019re going to do another 3 million about. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve said. \nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: You\u2019ll do 3 million TV homes? \nIvan G. Seidenberg : No, homes passed we\u2019ll do. \nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: I guess it\u2019s open for market on TV. Should we be thinking that at the end of this year, you\u2019ll be at 5 million open for market on TV? \nDoreen A. Toben: That\u2019s a relatively -- about that number is a good number, Simon. \nIvan G. Seidenberg : We\u2019ll clarify that over the course of the first quarter, give you a little better information but you\u2019re not that far off. \nDennis F. Strigl: Simon, if I may add, first of all, looking at last year, we feel very good about the FiOS data adds that we had. Video actually was over our goal, and as Doreen had mentioned in her comments, penetration increased in the fourth quarter to 14%. So we feel very good about our goals and growth opportunity in \u201907. Everybody loves the service: the speed, the service quality, the reliability. As you may know, in a recent consumer reports review, we blew away the competition.  Our view is that the market is ready for the upgrade that we can provide. \nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, Simon. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Mike McCormack of Bear Stearns. \nMichael McCormack - Bear Stearns: Thanks, guys. Just a quick comment, if you would, on wireline margins. We obviously can quantify the impact on the quarter from FiOS and MCI, but maybe just a comment on seasonality and what impact that might have had on the wireline margin, because it really held up pretty well. I\u2019m just trying to see if there\u2019s still an impact there.  Secondly, and maybe it\u2019s a combined question here, but on data, data was I think across the industry so far a little bit weak. So maybe some trends you\u2019re seeing in the DSL marketplace. FiOS adds were good but you missed your target there, so are we seeing just sort of an aging of the base you\u2019re selling into?  Then, connected to that, the access line losses. The rate of decline actually worsened, but the rate of worsening actually is the best we have seen in several quarters, so maybe just some comments on the cable competitiveness. Thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: First of all, we didn\u2019t miss any targets on FiOS. We feel very good about the FiOS number.  But let me come back to margin outlook. We expect wireline margins to stabilize, certainly not to get worse. We could see some I\u2019ll call it lumpiness from quarter to quarter, but overall, we see improvement in late \u201907 and into 2008.  If I can break down just the two wireline pieces, in telecom, we see continued success in our FiOS rollout. Operating expense savings, we expect to see as FiOS gains some scale. Continued ARPU growth and, as I mentioned earlier, incidentally we\u2019re very focused on elimination of time in the home to improve our overall metrics on FiOS.  On the business side, we\u2019re achieving the merger synergies, improving our cost structure and frankly, we are gaining market share, so we feel quite good about how we\u2019re positioned for 2007. \nDoreen A. Toben: If I could go back just a second on wireline margins, there was perhaps some seasonality in the fourth Q, or maybe I would suggest as you think about \u201907 and you think about on the Verizon business side, each quarter with their synergies, their margin improved, as well as the fact that the FiOS dilution is the worst in the beginning of the year, you might see -- Denny called it lumpiness, but you may see the wireline margins stabilize but sort of ramp up as opposed to flat across the whole year. \nDennis F. Strigl: Mike, on the access line outlook, our goal is less overall line loss in \u201907 than we saw in 2006. FiOS will of course increasingly help, particularly in the second-half of the year, as we gain some scale with FiOS, but I will tell you that we also have a significant focus on retention of access lines in \u201907. \nDoreen A. Toben: On the competitive piece, as you would expect, the competitors that have been in market for a long time are probably flat to down, and perhaps the ones that are newer in an area are up, but I would say actually overall, the VOIP adds appear to be relatively flat Q-to-Q. \nMichael McCormack - Bear Stearns: I know you guys are not really focused on the cost per home number specifically, but can you give us your sense for how close you are to what the year-end goals were? \nDoreen A. Toben: I think what I said was we certainly beat in both cases what we told you, so we were much better. Then, the other thing I would tell you is we\u2019re probably not going to give this to you every quarter. We gave you the five-year number. We\u2019re not that far off, if you look at homes for pass to what we told you the five-year number was, and connected. Considering we beat both of them, you know what the five-year target is, I probably am not going to give you the absolute number of Q-to-Q now. \nMichael McCormack - Bear Stearns: Okay, thanks, Doreen. Thanks, guys. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Chris Larsen of Credit Suisse. \nChris Larsen - Credit Suisse: Thanks, good morning. First question, the incremental capital spend, it looks a little bit higher, particularly in wireline. Can you give us a sense where the mix shift is? Is that more a function of incremental set-top boxes, as you\u2019re going to add about three times the number of subs this year?  Secondly, on the FiOS solution, Denny, how do you think about balancing growth versus the dilution? If you go back to the wireless days, it was just grow as quick and get as much market share as possible. If we look at what is going on in video, this may be the opportunity to grab that share as people are making this transition to high definition and the flat panel TVs, and this could be your one opportunity to hurry up and get in there as people decide what new TV to get in the home. \nDoreen A. Toben: I\u2019m going to start on the capital side, Chris. If you think about the increase, it\u2019s probably in a couple different places. One, it\u2019s much more success-based, so you see it in the set-top box and the cost to connect. However, there\u2019s also a substantial piece of it on what I would call the business side of it. We\u2019ve done real well on web hosting. That seems to be expanding, so we\u2019re going to grow web hosting. We\u2019ll do some things perhaps in international, as well as we talked about the fact we didn\u2019t spend as much as I would have anticipated in integration capital this year on trying to get access charges down, doing some more co-locations, doing some more grooming, doing some more putting buildings on net. So we\u2019re going to see that number kick up as well, so it\u2019s sort of a mix of the two different areas. \nDennis F. Strigl: On the FiOS growth, your comment was right on. Yes, we see that we have a window of opportunity with a superior product to what our competitors have, so our goal is to be very aggressive in FiOS, particularly on the video side.  I will also tell you though that as in wireless, we\u2019ve learned some lessons there, of course, we\u2019re focused not only on growing FiOS but also on controlling our costs and margin improvement. So that\u2019s the story. What we\u2019ve done in wireless, our goal is to do the same with our FiOS new product offering. \nRon Lataille : Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tom Seitz of Lehman Brothers. \nThomas Seitz - Lehman Brothers: Thanks for taking the question. A couple of quick ones. Could you talk debt levels? I guess I\u2019m particularly interested in Verizon Wireless. By our estimates, there essentially won\u2019t be any net debt at the end of this year. I\u2019m wondering what sort of arrangement you have with Vodafone regarding the uses of free cash flow. Are you going to have to lever back up?  Secondly, small business was stronger than we were looking for. I was wondering, are you engaged in win-back campaigns now, as Cablevision\u2019s entrance matures in your markets? Or is that just more of a macro environment trend? Thanks. \nDoreen A. Toben: Starting at the debt level, I would suggest you\u2019re probably a year off on when the debt goes perhaps to zero. Not quite sure what is happening with spectrum, when the 700 auction comes up, if we participate in the 700 auction. But when it does get to a zero, it would be at our discretion to put forth what kind of a dividend policy we wanted to have. I think that\u2019s more an \u201908 discussion than an \u201907 discussion, Tom. \nThomas Seitz - Lehman Brothers: Okay. \nDennis F. Strigl: Tom, let me comment on the small business piece. First, I would say that the small business market clearly to us is important. It is a growing market. I would also say that competition is not at all new in the small business space. We\u2019re focused on retention. We\u2019re focused on win-backs and I will tell you that I think we are in a good position. Our key differentiator is our reliability and our quality. We have a dedicated sales force of some 4,000 people.  And I will also tell you that the MCI merger has helped us in this regard, because it gives us a strong agent channel that comes from the merger. We\u2019re very focused in small business. \nDoreen A. Toben: Just so I was clear, it\u2019s an \u201908 -- on the dividend, it\u2019s an \u201908 discussion for probably an \u201909 implementation. \nThomas Seitz - Lehman Brothers: Okay. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, Tom. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Qaisar Hasan of Buckingham Research. \nQaisar Hasan - Buckingham Research: Good morning. I had a couple of quick questions. One, just on consumer rate increases, we understand you recently raised prices on your freedom plans by $5. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, whether in fact just new customers, existing customers? It seems to be a slight change in your strategy versus a couple of years ago, where you were actually quite aggressive on your pricing, given competition. What\u2019s changed in your thinking that\u2019s actually allowing you to actually raise prices not just on voice, but also data and video?  Secondly, on MCI, based on the numbers that you guys have provided in the past, I think you did about $350 million in synergies in the first three quarters, which implies probably about $250 million in the fourth quarter. Given that run-rate, the $900 million in \u201907 looks a little bit on the light side. Could you just maybe walk through the math there and where we might be off? Thanks. \nDoreen A. Toben: Qaisar, I\u2019ll start on the pricing. We did up the price on freedom across the county about $5. We felt based on the take rates we were getting and the churn that we were able to do that. We\u2019ve not seen a decrease in the sales because of the increase. We also had an increase in the DSL pricing, especially at the low end. The numbers that we had at $14.95, we\u2019ve seen them move up to $17, $19 and $21 in some states. I think if you compare that to any other offer, any other cable model offer, we\u2019re still at the low end. We\u2019ve seen very successful take rates and thought that we could do it. The churn has come down significantly. We\u2019re not playing on the price side at all on the video market. We\u2019ve been really pleased with our video pricing and our video ARPU, so the churn and everything has really shown us that we\u2019ve got the ability to have some pricing flexibility here.  On the MCI synergies, I\u2019ll take another look at it next year. I probably am always conservative, so what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll start with that number and as I work through \u201907, we\u2019ll see if we update it as we get into the year. \nQaisar Hasan - Buckingham Research: Great, and Doreen, could you just confirm that the freedom rate increase was across your existing base and not just on new customers? \nDoreen A. Toben: It is my understanding, but we might have to get back to you, that it was across the base. It was not just on new. \nQaisar Hasan - Buckingham Research: Great, thank you. \nRon Lataille : Thanks. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. \nFrank Louthan - Raymond James: Good morning, thanks. Quickly, on the data center outlook, give us an idea on what are you seeing in the demand for that or any pricing? As far as your cap-ex expansion on that, are you planning to build entirely new data centers or build out some more?  Then, as far as doing the work on trying to keep the install time down on FiOS, maybe a little more color on that. What is the average install time running relative to what the target is? Do you think at some point it might make sense possibly just to run some additional cap five or something like that to try and cut that time down? I know that\u2019s not been part of the strategy, but would that possibly be an additional part of the strategy going forward, given the time constraints you\u2019re running up against? Thanks. \nDoreen A. Toben: I\u2019ll start on the web hosting. You meant web hosting, right, Frank, when you said data centers? \nFrank Louthan - Raymond James: Yes, that\u2019s what I meant, yes. \nDoreen A. Toben: Okay. Yes, we\u2019ve had incredible demand for web hosting all year, and so you\u2019ll probably see us do some more build-outs to try to meet the demand. It\u2019s really been an expanding product segment for us. Obviously it\u2019s in the capital numbers increase that we gave you. \nDennis F. Strigl: On the install time for FiOS, as I had mentioned a little bit earlier, we are deploying some time-saving technologies, MOCA being one of them. We\u2019ve got a new software tool to help configure the PCs and also the TVs in the home. We do not disclose the number of hours, but rest assured that we\u2019re doing everything we can to get that number down and to drive costs out of our installation and we\u2019re on the targets that we had established. \nFrank Louthan - Raymond James: Do you think those processes will be sufficient, or it would, you know, possibly doing some additional wiring as a means just to avoid some of the hold-ups with the wiring in the house? Would that be part of the strategy, something that you would consider down the road? \nDennis F. Strigl: Frank, I will comment that we are looking at all opportunities to cut our costs. \nFrank Louthan - Raymond James: That\u2019s great. Thank you. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, Frank. Operator, I would like to now turn the call over to Ivan Seidenberg for some concluding remarks. \nIvan G. Seidenberg : Thank you for your questions. As you can see, we feel comfortable and we\u2019re very confident that 2006 turns out to be a very solid year for us. We accomplished some significant repositioning of lots of assets in the business. We were able to unlock some value and create some substantial financial flexibility going forward for the company.  As you can see, we\u2019re a simpler, more focused business. All of our groups have momentum leaving \u201906 and into \u201907, the wireless group and the business group and the teleco group. Also, our Verizon Services group, which is our infrastructure support services group across the business, gained some momentum and they will certainly help to ameliorate a lot of the growth activities we have by some strong, cost management across the company.  Business conditions across all three of our groups appear to be gaining some momentum in \u201907, so we feel comfortable that the market will provide a little bit of a wind at our back, in addition to all of the investments that we\u2019re making.  Frankly, our focus for 2007 is pretty simple: we\u2019re intent on achieving higher sustainable growth rates at the same time we\u2019re delivering bottom-line performance. The management changes we made are clearly geared to help us accelerate getting bottom-line performance with all of the capital we\u2019ve deployed over the last several years going forward.  Many of you would like to know what we\u2019re going to do with our cash. We feel we have a great balance sheet. We have done a lot of good things. Doreen mentioned that we\u2019ll continue the share buy-back program that we have now. We\u2019re always looking for ways, as the year unfolds, to further unlock value should the opportunity arise.  Having said that, we thank you for your participation and we\u2019re looking forward to a positive 2007. \nRon Lataille : Operator, that concludes our call today. Thank you, everybody, for joining us. \nTRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nCompany sponsors its own earnings call transcript:\nCompany sponsors partner's transcript:\nCompany sponsors competitor's transcript:\nIssuer-sponsored research firm sponsors client's transcript:\nInvestment newsletter sponsors transcripts of successful stock picks:\nIR firm sponsors transcript of micro-cap company:\nConsulting company sponsors company's transcript in sector of interest: Your company's name and promotion could have been on this transcript!

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Verizon\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nRon Lataille: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2006 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I am Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and CEO; and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast, and if you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained within this presentation and is also contained in our SEC filings which are available on our website.  This presentation also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the SEC rules. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on the same web page as our presentation slides.  Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I would like to provide an update on a few items and cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings.  First, in mid-October the board approved the proposed spin-off of our domestic directory business to our shareholders. The spin-off will result in a new public company called Idearc which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange following the spin-off under the symbol IAR. A November 1, 2006 record date has been established for the spin-off, along with a distribution ratio of one Idearc share for every 20 Verizon shares. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, distribution of shares is scheduled to occur on, or about, November 17.  As you know, the recently adopted pension accounting pronouncement FAS 158 will be effective December 31, 2006. FAS 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit plans as either an asset or a liability on the balance sheet. Based on our current estimates, we expect to decrease shareowners equity by approximately $10 billion post-tax. There is no impact to cash or earnings as a result of the adoption of this change. Additional information on FAS 158 will be included in our third quarter 10-Q. I also want to make sure you are aware of one other item which is included in our equity and earnings of unconsolidated businesses line. During the third quarter, we recognized an $85 million favorable tax benefit from Vodafone Omnitel. Now, as far as our third quarter results, reported earnings per diluted share were $0.66. On an adjusted basis, before the effects of special items, EPS was $0.68. The special items that make up the difference between reported and adjusted EPS are discussed in our earnings release and provided in reconciliation tables in the investor quarterly bulletin.  Briefly, there are three special items which we are excluding from adjusted results: With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. \nDoreen Toben: Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that we had another strong quarter as both wireless and wireline continued to perform well and contributed to our objective of creating long-term growth. Each of our three network platforms are focused on delivering quality, growth and creating long-term value.  Verizon Wireless continues to grow. Its high performance, organic growth model demonstrates the long-term benefits of a deep and profitable relationship with our customers. In the quarter, revenue growth exceeded 18%. We added 2 million retail customers and also increased service ARPU.  Our investments in the wireline business are creating the same foundation for long-term growth. We are building new customer relationships through our broadband initiatives. We now have 522,000 FiOS data customers and 118,000 FiOS video customers. The increase in FiOS data customers drove another excellent quarter for total broadband performance. Between DSL and FiOS data, we generated 448,000 net adds this quarter.  In the enterprise business market, we continue to see major contract wins and renewals as we expand and deepen our relationships with customers. Revenues from key strategic services like IP and managed services grew 25% and helped drive our second straight quarter of sequential growth.  Okay. Let's turn to slide 4 and look at some of the details. Total revenues were up 25.8% versus the year-ago quarter, a comparison that is favorably affected by the inclusion of MCI this year. Throughout the rest of the discussion, when I refer to year-over-year comparisons, they will be on a pro forma basis unless otherwise noted.  Consolidated revenue growth was 3.6% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially. Revenue increases were once again driven by growth in wireless, broadband and enterprise data services. Operating income increased 6.6% and operating income margins increased 50 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the effect of net pensions and OPEB which amounted to $332 million in the third quarter and slightly higher than last year. Also remember that we do not exclude the effects of amortization of intangibles from our adjusted results. The amount of amortization expense related to the acquisition of MCI is about $210 million annually and is $53 million this quarter. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.68 per share.  Looking at our cash flows and balance sheet, we continue to have very strong cash generation. On a year-to-date basis, CFFO for our continuing operations totaled $17.9 billion, $2.9 billion higher than the same period last year. Year-to-date capital spending was $12.3 billion, of which $7.3 billion is wireline and $4.8 billion is wireless. We continue to maintain out stated guidance for full-year CapEx spending.  Debt was $41.7 billion at September 30, and all our credit metrics remain strong.  Let's turn now to the wireline financials on slide 6. Revenues were up sequentially for the second quarter in a row and continue to show steady improvement year over year. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter revenues were down 4.7%, which is better than the 6.2% decline in the second quarter and the 6.8% decline in the first quarter. So we are definitely seeing an improvement in the top line.  In addition to our focus on improving the top line, we are equally focused on the expense side. Third quarter cash expenses declined 1.3% year over year; excluding FiOS, cash expenses decreased by $350 million, or 3.8% year over year. Our goal is to offset FiOS expenses with reductions in the core business. You can see from our results that wireline margins were sequentially lower in the third quarter, primarily due to access line losses and increased FiOS dilution.  FiOS represented $0.09 of total earnings dilution this quarter, up $0.02 from the second quarter. This incremental dilution was driven by strong customer growth and higher video cost. At this point, we expect full-year FiOS earnings dilution to be about $0.31 to $0.32 per share, which is about $0.02 higher than our previous guidance. As a result, we are expecting fourth quarter wireline margins to reflect these changes.  In addition to our continued focus on reducing costs in the traditional telecom business, we will also see increasing flow through of cost savings in the large enterprise market. While only nine months into our integration of MCI, we are on track with our plans and are already seeing significant operational benefits. When we complete the billing and other system conversions, we will see additional cost synergies. Going forward, we continue to see significant opportunities for wireline cost savings.  A big driver of the underlying revenue growth comes from data. This data transformation is improving our revenue mix and creating higher value, more retentive customers, both residential and business. Data is becoming more significant and now represents 32% of total wireline revenues.  Quarterly data revenues totaled $4.1 billion, up 6.3% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Within telecom, data growth is driven by the strong demand for broadband in the consumer and small business markets, as well as continued, healthy demand for high-speed, high capacity services in the wholesale market. Total mass market broadband subscribers now total 6.6 million with more than 6 million DSL customers and 522,000 FiOS data subs.  In Verizon business, quarterly data revenues totaled $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion of which comprises what we call \u201cstrategic services\u201d. These revenues, which include Internet, IP, private IP, various management services such as network solutions and Ethernet and ring services, grew nearly 25% since last year and are up 5% sequentially.  The next chart is a closer look at telecom revenues. The most encouraging news here is that consumer retail revenues, excluding mass-market MCI, increased sequentially for the first time since the second quarter of last year, due primarily to broadband growth. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter revenues were down 3.3%, which is an improvement from the 4% decline in the second quarter. Also encouraging is the fact that average revenue per household per month has increased more than 2% sequentially and year over year, providing evidence that our broadband initiatives are expanding our relationship with customers.  Revenues from the former MCI mass market business were $637 million and declined $204 million or 24.4% year on year. The important takeaway here is that growth is improving in the key areas of focus, namely data and broadband.  Let's look at some customer metrics. In residential retail, let's start with our 23 million primary voice lines which are down 419,000 sequentially. Primary voice lines are generally impacted more by competition from either wireless, cable telephony or some IP substitute service. As you know, our competitive response has been to push our broadband products, both DSL and FiOS data, bundle them with our voice services and in certain markets, combine that with a FiOS TV offer. I would say we're doing fairly well. During the third quarter, we added 120,000 more net broadband and video customers than the decline in primary lines.  In addition, we have many more customers on voice packages. The number of Freedom customers has increased by about 2.5 million in the past year. We now have about 7.5 million in total. On a consumer RGU basis, which includes additional or secondary lines, we were up about 1% versus last year, and essentially flat sequentially. We tend to view additional or secondary line loss as being driven more by secular change and technology substitutions than competition. In fact, our own broadband initiatives are influencing customers to disconnect their additional lines.  Our bundling and broadband initiatives are starting to take hold. We believe that this expanded customer relationship will improve revenue per household and increase customer loyalty, thereby improving retention. Total access lines were down 7.5% compared with a year ago, and were 977,000 lower on a sequential quarterly basis. One-third of the total lines lost in the quarter were a combination of wholesale lines and former MCI mass market customers in regions.  We will spend the next few minutes on FiOS. About a month ago, we conducted a FiOS briefing session in which we talked about our revenue opportunities, the network transformation, the customer experience and the business plan assumptions and economics. Hopefully one of your takeaways from that session was our enthusiasm and the progress to-date and our confidence in the plan assumptions and outlook. Our quarterly results demonstrate the steady progress we are making and validation of our confidence.  As I mentioned earlier, we had 522,000 FiOS data customers at the end of the quarter. Third quarter net adds were 147,000 compared with 111,000 in the second quarter. We had 3.8 million homes open for sale. Our subscriber penetration rate was 14%. You can see from the ramp and our customer additions that we are gaining market share in a growing broadband market.  Our FiOS video customer total was 118,000 at the end of the quarter. Here, quarterly net adds were 63,000 compared with 35,000 last quarter. With 1.2 million homes open for sale, we currently have a 10% subscriber penetration rate. As we indicated, customer acceptance in video is ahead of plan and the fact that we have many new and innovative features just around the corner bodes well for us, and we continue to differentiate our video service.  Lastly, our churn in FiOS customers this quarter remains under 1.5% per month. Our full-year targets of 725,000 FiOS data customers and 175,000 FiOS video customers remains the same.  A quick update with where we are with the capital cost to pass and connect premises. Starting with the cost of pass, again, we are pleased with our progress to-date. We have moved average costs down from 1,400 per home to 845 as of the end of September. That is a 40% decline in less then two years.  On the capital cost to connect, we have moved costs down steadily as we have gained experience and expect this will continue. Capital cost per premise connected was $900 in September, down 25% this year, and we feel good about our $880 target by the end of the year. Beyond next quarter, we believe that GPON and other technologies will help us to further reduce capital spending per home and expect to see greater improvements as we move through the year.  From a deployment standpoint, we had passed 5.3 million premises through the end of September, and we should have no problem meeting our goal of 6 million cumulative by the end of December.  In Verizon business, we are focused on sequential revenue improvement. Revenues were up once again on a sequential basis, increasing by 1.7%. In the enterprise business, the sequential growth of 3% this quarter is an improvement over the 1% sequential growth last quarter. Continued traction in our strategic services revenues is driving the sequential growth. I talked about this earlier in the context of wireline data revenues. We are seeing growth in Internet, private IP, Ethernet and ring services. We are also seeing some improvement in core services trends. Data services like ATM, frame and private line were up slightly. Voice services were essentially flat.  In addition, we saw strong government project revenues and some improvements in CPE sales. We are optimistic that we will continue to see steady improvement in both enterprise and total revenues and expect to see year-over-year growth in total business revenues within the next two quarters.  Broadly speaking, considering all aspects of combining the two companies, we would say that the integration efforts, after only nine months, have been a great success. We are definitely seeing operational benefits: salesforce and product integration, marketing efforts and customer relationship work have all gone very well.  As far as synergies go, we realized about $150 million in incremental synergies during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to around $350 million. Most of these savings are driven by headcount reductions, sourcing savings, network optimizations and traffic migration. We also have a number of systems integration projects underway that will result in additional cost savings in 2007 and beyond. We are currently on track to meet our synergy target for the year of $550 million. So, good progress at Verizon business.  Let's turn now to wireless. Verizon wireless continues to deliver outstanding, industry-leading financial results and performance metrics. Total quarterly revenues, which are now just shy of $10 billion, grew 18.2% year-over-year. Sequentially, revenues were up $607 million or 6.6%. Verizon wireless has the highest total revenues in the industry, as well as the highest growth rate.  Notably, this growth was once again accompanied by the industry's best margins. EBITDA grew to $3.8 billion, a sequential improvement of 6.8%. The quarterly EBITDA margin was 45%, up from 41.5% a year ago and 44.4% in the second quarter. Our margin performance is driven by the quality of our customer base and our efficient cost structure. Strong growth in service revenues was again driven by increased data usage and significant customer growth. Total service ARPU of $50.59 increased almost 2% sequentially and nearly 1% year over year. Not surprisingly, this is entirely retail-related. Data revenues accounted for more than 14% of service revenue and represented $1.2 billion of revenue in the quarter. Data made up $7.16 of total service ARPU, up substantially year-over-year and $0.76 sequentially.  We had an outstanding quarter of customer growth. Our retail customer growth is, far and away, the best in the industry. We added 2 million net new retail customers during the quarter, extending our industry lead in having the most retail customers. These are customers that choose Verizon-branded service from our direct and indirect channels. Total net adds were 1.9 million, as reseller churn resulted in a net negative of about 70,000 customers. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter in which we added more than 1.5 million net retail customers.  Our 54.6 million retail customers represent more than 96% of our total customer base of 56.7 million. Retail postpaid customers represent nearly 93% of our base. This quarter, 88% of all retail gross adds were postpaid. This was higher sequentially, although lower than last year. Retail continues to be our focus. That is because we serve and manage these customers directly. These are high quality customers in terms of loyalty and lifetime revenue. They also tend to have the highest margins.  We continue to outperform the industry when it comes to customer loyalty. Total customer churn was 1.24%, retail churn was 1.15%, and retail postpaid churn was 0.95%. All three of these churn rates are lower than the third quarter last year. The slight sequential increases in each are in line with previous seasonal trends.  Retail gross adds in the quarter were almost 6% higher than a year ago and sequentially better by more than 10%. This performance is particularly impressive, considering some of the predictions last year when we decided not to continue our RadioShack relationship. Retail gross adds from direct channel grew even faster, up 9.1% year-over-year. Importantly, these direct channels produce 74% of our retail postpaid gross adds this quarter. This is a key metric for us and one that we track very closely. This is because we know that customers buying through our direct channels have higher ARPU and lower churn.  We also continued to expand and diversify our indirect distribution channel, which includes local and national outlets like Best Buy, Costco and Wal-Mart. Taking advantage of new retail channels and models, both direct and with our indirect partners, has helped us maintain a high quality base and been an important factor in developing our industry-leading efficiency and profitability.  As I have said many times, the key to our success in wireless data is our commitment to investing in our premier network. Nearly 31 million, or about 57% of our retail customers, are data users, up significantly from just one year ago. To date, 13.7 million or more than 25% of our retail customers, have EV-DO capable devices. Moreover, data revenues from business applications such as broadband access and email have increased 135% in just one year. More than one-third of our data revenues come from business focused applications.  We have three times more broadband access subscribers than one year ago and more than 55% of our data revenue growth comes from services other than messaging, primarily EV-DO based. We have an industry-leading portfolio of EV-DO capable devices, and we're taking advantage of exclusive periods on such devices as the Motorola Q, the LG Chocolate and the Samsung i830.  In spite of these impressive data growth numbers, we are really just at the beginning of the wireless broadband revolution, and we have the network and products to take significant advantage of this growth trend.  I will summarize the quarter as follows. We're gaining market share and expanding customer relationships. It is true in broadband and video with Verizon DSL and FiOS. It is true in Verizon business, and it is certainly true in Verizon wireless. Our organic growth initiatives are gaining momentum. We expect to continue this steady progress, and we are confident that this will differentiate us long term.  On the cost side, we continue to see significant opportunities. We know how to control expenses, and we have an intense focus on reducing costs. Along with strong operational execution, we continue to increase our financial flexibility and increase value to our shareowners.  As far as our current share buyback program, we repurchased an additional $350 million in shares during the third quarter for a total of $1.35 billion year-to-date. You will recall that we originally estimated $1 billion for the full year, and we did that in six months. At that time, we increased the buyback program by another $500 million for the second half of the year. We expect to complete the $1.5 billion by year end.  As Ron noted earlier, the Idearc spin-off has been approved by our Board with distribution of shares scheduled to occur on or about November 17. As Idearc has reported in its SEC filings, Idearc plans to incur about $9 billion of debt in connection with the spin-off. As a result of the spin-off, Verizon will reduce its debt by about $7 billion through a debt-for-debt exchange mechanism and will receive about $2 billion in cash.  As previously announced, we plan to recommend to the board that it maintain the Verizon annual dividend at its current level immediately following the spin-off. Going forward, our intention is to continue to pay a competitive dividend.  Finally, the sales of our Latin America assets are proceeding. All these changes to our asset portfolio, along with continued strong cash generation, will unlock value for our owners. In summary, we are on track to meet our operational and financial performance targets for the year.  With that, I will turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Ivan and Doreen are now ready for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Barden - Banc of America Securities.\n David Barden - Banc of America Securities: Hi guys, good morning. Two questions, if I could, Doreen. Maybe the first on, as you pointed out, the Latin America sales looking on track, the directories spin-off is moving ahead. When you look at the cash that is going to be coming in the door from those and the debt capacity that will be opened up, could you talk a little bit more about what the game plan is as your buybacks starts to come to resolution here?  The second thing would be just on the margins, You were talking about operational expense goals on target. One of those goals was expanding wireline margins sequentially over the course of the year. You have taken up the FiOS solution guidance a few pennies, but it does not seem like necessarily that would be the biggest driver for some of the margin compression we saw on wireline.  if you could kind of elaborate a little on the net impact of MCI merger statement versus the FiOS guidance that you have said would be reflected in the fourth quarter number, that would be great. \nDoreen Toben: Okay. Maybe if I start with the cash question. I think first we should say we feel really good about what we have accomplished this year. The $1.5 billion share buyback looks to be a good target for us. We think that the spin-out of directory is creating incremental value for us. And then, as you know noted I think in one of your write-ups, the spin-out actually increases the dividend for Verizon. So it probably gives us, I don't know, 4%, to 4.5% dividend increase this year. We have about just under $3 billion coming back from international. We also have $2.8 billion in spectrum that we need to pay for, mostly in the fourth quarter.  So I think if we complete all these transactions, what I would expect is at least a $7 billion debt reduction coming in from the directory piece. We will use the cash on the $2.8 billion of spectrum that is a fourth quarter item, and then I think for the rest of it, what we are going to do is certainly meet with our Board, go through what we will do with the rest of the cash and it will be a first quarter discussion, I think, with you folks.  On the margin question, I would say it really is predominantly FiOS. In the FiOS area, I would suggest it was mostly in cost of acquisition. Two things: the video ads were a little bit higher than we expected. Cost of acquisition, marketing installation a little bit high. Not bothered by that, because similar to the capital costs and homes passed and homes connected, we feel comfortable that we are going to be able to get the numbers where we need, so that was really driving it, as well as there was a one-time true-up on the content cost. We really hadn\u2019t been doing much on content cost because it was so early on, so the third quarter had a pretty decent accrual to start the content cost. \n David Barden - Banc of America Securities: What was that number, Doreen? \nDoreen Toben: I actually don't have it right in front of me. Maybe Ron can get it to you later, but it was probably not insignificant from the FiOS perspective. As far as synergies with the VZB, they are on track. We are comfortable with them, and they will certainly grow to the 550 in the fourth quarter. It is predominantly a FiOS issue as far as the margin, coupled with the access lines are probably a little bit softer than we had originally anticipated in the plan. It is probably the other piece of the margin story. \n David Barden - Banc of America Securities: Great, thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Halpern - Sanford Bernstein. \n Jeffrey Halpern - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks. A couple of questions for you. The first one on wireless and Verizon business. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in the ability for Verizon business to really cross-sell the wireless services, especially as you are moving into managed services and starting to beef up those offerings, the ability to help enterprise customers move applications to the mobile and to the network?  Secondly, just to follow-up on David's question about FiOS and specifically focusing on multiple dwelling units in '07, because you mentioned in your FiOS briefing session a couple of weeks ago that you are clearly moving closer to that, and it is a significant portion of your base of access lines. Can you talk a little bit about how you anticipate the CapEx to connect customers looking in '07 given the MDU discussion? \nIvan Seidenberg: On the first question, a couple of things going on right now on the cross-selling with the technologies. We have very sophisticated approaches to putting bids together and working with customers. So we have our salesforces out making joint proposals to customers. We have our operations teams working through operational capabilities for our customers. We have just had a couple of industry conferences in which we have laid out some longer-term product maps so that we can show our customers exactly how we see some of the capabilities.  For example, when you look at IP protocols both for wireless and land line, you're looking at four-digit dialing both in wireless and land line. So we are looking at a whole series of capabilities that will unfold out over the next two to three years and give customers a sense of where we're heading with this.  I think there is a lot of discussion about this wireless/wireline issue. I think the important point for us is to focus on solution selling and help customers understand how the technology unfolds. So we're at the beginning. We have a couple of trials going on here or there on various capabilities.  On the consumer side, Jeff, you didn\u2019t ask, but on that we're about to open up a couple of stores that will sell both wireless and broadband, so we're looking at some things that we're doing in that area. So this is an exciting opportunity for us, but it is going to be driven mostly by product evolution, and that is how we see taking advantage of the opportunity. \nDoreen Toben: On the multiple dwelling unit question, first I would say that I think we're making progress as far as getting the builder/owner\u2019s consent, which was a big piece of the MDUs. Certainly have made technical progress in being able to do it. I would suggest that we would anticipate on a cost to connect that it should actually run cheaper, as you would expect, depending on what technology. So that actually should be a help to us. \n Jeffrey Halpern - Sanford Bernstein: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik - UBS. \n John Hodulik - UBS : Good morning. Two quick ones, maybe first for you, Doreen. With the FiOS guidance, does the increase in expected dilution this year make you more confident in your ability to lower that number in '07? If that is not the case, is it purely a success-based issue where if you add more subscribers, that number could go up, or just your thoughts on that given the new guidance would be great.  And then maybe one for Ivan. The wireless results are obviously very strong, and I think we were surprised on the net add side considering a lot of other carriers are having trouble adding subscribers. Do you see an end to this, given the penetration rates we're seeing in the US, or do you think you can maintain this level for another year or two? I would just love to hear how you think about the industry, given the strong margins and net adds. \nDoreen Toben: John, I will start with the FiOS question. I would suggest that we have said FiOS dilution should be about flat for '07. I will continue with that kind of guidance. It is, as you would imagine, however, success-based. To the extent we are much more successful than we think in video or data, that number would move. But for right now, I would still suggest it is about flat. \n John Hodulik - UBS : Great.\nIvan Seidenberg: On the wireless question, look, we are very excited about our wireless results, obviously. They have been strong for almost four years now, five years. So here is the way we think about it. We think that the growth in wireless and the sustainability of our performance is really a function of how the team thinks about investing in their business. So I believe that they have made very smart, very prudent and very thoughtful investments in their capabilities. So whether it is investments in the network; we have been on the network promotion game since 1999, 2001. So now we are up to EV-DO, EV-DO RevA. We have invested in the channels. We have invested in great handsets and products. We have great culture. We have good distribution across the company.  So my view of all of this is that as long as you see us making forward-looking investments in our capabilities that the growth should be sustainable. In fact, our view is that if you look at the results for the last couple of quarters, most of the analysts ask us if we can sustain it. Actually if you look at the results, we have actually widened the lead across the board.  I think as the industry goes through consolidations, companies are going through various changes in their own business. I think we are in a position where we have been through most of those changes. We can take advantage of this. If you want a good analogy, it is a little bit like trying to catch the Kenyans in marathon running. I think you can keep improving your numbers, but I have a feeling that the Kenyans keep getting faster. \n John Hodulik - UBS : Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley. \n Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Thank you, good morning. Ivan, given that we've now almost completed the directory spin, is it time to again open discussions with Vodafone to see if there's any change in their position?  Also, on the small medium-size business, some of your competitors have seen very strong growth in that unit, and that is something that hasn\u2019t yet turned around for you. Are there specific dynamics that might make that better in '07? Thanks.\nIvan Seidenberg: Simon, I'm happy to answer the first question. I wouldn\u2019t link the two. I think that if I can, since you asked it that way, I might take a second and just comment. When we think of the directory spin, our board has been very focused on why we are investing for growth in FiOS and in wireless and in completing the Verizon business transaction with MCI, that we were very concerned about making sure we return some value to shareholders. At the same time, we were improving our balance sheet. So we think the spin stands on its own. We feel good about it.  As to the Vodafone issue, I think it stands where it always has. This is driven by Vodafone's view of their business. We have a contract with them that would suggest they pull the trigger on whether they want to exit the put or not, and that as you might all view, that over the last several months, every time it looks like Verizon is instigating any change it has a negative effect on both stocks.  So I think the agreement I have with Arum is that if and when he is ever ready to consider it, that is the way we will move forward. At this point we're not assuming that Vodafone has changed its mind on this put. \nDoreen Toben: I think on the small and medium business, I would start with some of it is definitional. I do think that we probably have a little bit more medium in our business definition perhaps than the others, so I'm not sure it's exactly apples-to-apples. Some of it is migration on the medium guys up to different data services. We are putting more feet on the street, more agency agreements, and also I think we are pretty encouraged because MCI brought a lot of products to the table that we did not have before. So if I look at our current ramp, it is much better than it was.  So I think going forward, I am encouraged with the additional sales capability and the additional products that they now have. \n Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan \u2013 CIBC. \n Tim Horan \u2013 CIBC: Thanks. Great quarter, guys. Two questions. Just to follow-up on the capital structure. Ivan, what do you think is the right kind of debt to EBITDA multiple longer term after you are done with a lot of these transactions and when FiOS dilution peaks?  Secondly, I guess more subtly, do you think the cable companies are targeting you where you're doing your FiOS upgrades or where you are about to, try to lock in customers before hand or during the process? Thanks.\nIvan Seidenberg: Okay. I will start, and if Doreen has anything she wants to add, she can. Look; on the debt to EBITDA numbers, just to make this pretty clear, if you take a look at the structure of our board, we have 12 of 14 directors who are financial experts, of which eight of them have been either the CFO or CEOs of both of their companies. For the past three or four years, they have been extremely pointed in directing us to do a couple of things, which is invest for growth -- which you see -- and at the same time, improve our balance sheet.  So our targets on debt to EBITDA were about 1.4, 1.5. Doreen and I have talked about this, and we think that in this kind of an environment and in this kind of an industry, it should probably be a little bit lower. So whether it is 1.2 or 1.1 or 1.3, that is something Doreen is more qualified to answer. But it definitely, long term, should be lower than the 1.5.  I think, Tim, we have moved in that direction. So we think a really strong balance sheet, coupled with strong investments in growth, is what our board has asked us to focus on. So I think we are moving through that. I think these shareholder-friendly transactions that we have been able to move on this year in terms of the Idearc spin, the sale of non-strategic long-term assets and moving through that is a good structure for us.  So, as we move out into the future, I think having a strong balance sheet is something that we want to make sure we have, as well as investment-grade ratings for our Company.  Hopefully that answers that in a way that gives you a sense that this is really a board-driven activity that frankly, Doreen and I agree with completely, and our job is to execute on that view. \nDoreen Toben: I guess the only thing I would add is it is probably no longer a one metric issue. So I don't think it's just debt to EBITDA, Tim, I think you have to look at free cash flow to debt as well. So I think there are a couple of other metrics that we will be working with and taking to our board in the beginning of the year to see where we land. But it definitely with directory going out, it is lower than 1.5 and higher than 1, so someplace in between. \n Tim Horan \u2013 CIBC: Thanks. And on the cable targeting of the FiOS upgrades, the reason I asked \u2013\nIvan Seidenberg: That is a good question. Here is what I would say to that. As we go over operating results, here is what we would say. We would say that a lot of the cable companies have had mature evolution of their technologies in some of our markets. Obviously Cablevision has, as has Comcast; so I don't think it is a question of targeting us. It is a matter of where they have started. Cox has also been pretty far along the train up there in the New England area. So I think the way I would look at this is not that we have been targeted. It is that it has followed along their own technology evolution, and I happen to believe that the models that you have seen in certain markets will roll out across the country in the way they have done that. The other side of the coin is, you can see in some of the markets where they have rolled out early, we have started to see a little bit of a plateauing of some of the services they are selling. So our view of this whole access line issue is that we will continue to see some pressure on access lines. Some will come from wireless substitutions. Some will come from the cable companies, the over-the-top VoIP. But we think, as we look out into the future, our strategies for our own wireless and our own FiOS will begin to arrest that. Perhaps Doreen could help you operationalize that in your models in a second here. \nDoreen Toben: As far as access lines? \nIvan Seidenberg: Yes, sure. \nDoreen Toben: What I would say is, as we go into '07 and we look at the back half of '07 third/fourth quarter, we would expect that you are going to see certainly an improvement in where we are today and a flattening of the access lines is what we are predicting. So it would be better. \n Tim Horan \u2013 CIBC: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns. \n Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns : Thanks, guys. Doreen, I am just trying to maybe dig into the margin question a little bit deeper. If you look at the pressure sequentially, we're looking at about 80 basis points of pressure sequentially. 70 basis points appears to be FiOS related, and then you've got an offset from MCI synergies ramping up, in my math, around 100 to 120 basis points. So it looks like there is something significant in the range of 100 to 130 basis points of pressure. Is that just increasing competition and pressures on the traditional business?  Secondly, on the enterprise revenue trends, obviously we\u2019re hearing good things across the industry. Maybe just a comment on the competitive environment, and Verizon's appetite, there has been a lot of consolidation. Are there any assets out there on the enterprise side that might be of interest? Thanks.\nDoreen Toben: I think on the margin issue, Mike, you were right, it is really coming, I mentioned in the text here, that it was access lines. I think it really is coming on the regular telco wireline side of the business in that the loss of access lines was causing the additional piece of the margin erosion for the most part. \nIvan Seidenberg: On the enterprise, Mike, I think on that point, a couple of things. Generally what we are seeing is some consistent pressure on some of the repricing of contracts like you would have normally seen. But we are seeing, for example, as Doreen pointed out earlier, strategic services are up over 20%, and we are seeing some stabilization in the way customers are looking at overall contracts. So we are feeling better about our ability to continue to ramp. As you can see in the results sequentially, we're up 3% in Verizon Business and 1.7% year-over-year.  As to your other question in terms of assets, no, I think we are pretty much focused on organic movement. We have a lot of work on the IT side and in the systems side to improve our capabilities. We're also working on product maps to generate a lot of new products and services. So we don't see a big strategic need for any movement at this point, so it is not something we are out in the market hunting for. \nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers. \n Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers: Thanks for taking the question. Could you comment on the demand environment in wireline business? The economic data seems to say one thing one week and another thing the next. I was wondering from your perspective, given the long sales cycle, are you seeing any slowing down in the number of RFPs that you're getting to look at or any requests for delays in circuit delivery, given the economic backdrop in the demand for business telcos services?  Secondly, with respect to small and medium business, are you starting to see in your territories any evidence of cable starting to target the small business market? They have certainly talked about doing it, and I was wondering any, prelaunch marketing activity, advertising campaigns, et cetera? Thanks.\nDoreen Toben: If I start on the demand side for Verizon business, we are incredibly pleased. You know, I would say they are not seeing any slowdown due to the economic conditions. More RFPs, I think, than they have ever seen. They are writing more business than they have ever seen. If you would talk to any of the salesforce, incredibly encouraged with what they are seeing. So absolutely none as far is that is concerned.  On the small business side, I think what we would say is cable, especially in our territory, Cablevision for a long time has been targeting the small business. You have probably seem maybe Comcast starting to ramp, but Cablevision has been after the business segment for a very long time. So I think we are used to it. I would say outside the Cablevision territory, I don't think it is something that we are seeing a lot of at the moment. \n Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers: Great, thank you very much.\nRon Lataille: Operator, I would like to turn the call over now to Ivan Seidenberg for some concluding remarks. \nIvan Seidenberg: Thank you. Just a couple of comments to close the call. As always, thank you for listening in and participating on our call. The headlines for us are pretty clear. We feel that this was an important quarter for us, not only in delivering the results that Doreen talked about, but beginning to see some expansion of our top line, particularly generating a lot of organic growth across the board. Our view of all of that is with the right investments in new platforms and services, the market is going to respond to the kind of innovation that we think all this technology brings. We think that if you look very quickly, VZW, a great quarter, making the right investments and our view is they have the capability to not only sustain, but continue to widen their read on the industry. In the telco, as you can see, we had overall a positive quarter, even though we do have some work to do to continue to drive profitability, but we are very comfortable and actually pleased with the expansion of the top line with our broadband volumes and the success of FiOS.  One thing we didn\u2019t get a chance to talk about is that every customer survey we do for people who already have FiOS, the churn is low and the customer satisfaction numbers are off the charts, so we know the product is a winning product and it is a question of making sure that we continue to drive the profitability, as you have been asking the question. Verizon business, lots of activity, top line expansion, lots of interest in customers moving to IP and MPLS. We still have obviously voice pressures on the business, but for the most part, customers are really being driven to all of the new technology. Lastly, hopefully you see in 2006 that we spent a great deal of time trying to unlock value in other ways in terms of asset sales, the Idearc spin, improving the balance sheet, share buyback that Doreen talked about, effective dividend increase that comes. So we feel good that as we head toward the end of the year, we have approached driving value for shareholders in a more balanced way, and hopefully you can see that it is being reflected in the performance of the stock so far this year.  So thank you all, and we will continue to do what we do and we will see you in the first quarter.\nRon Lataille: Operator, that concludes our third quarter earnings call. Thank you everybody for joining us today."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2006, "date": "2006-08-01 13:09:55", "content": "Executives: Ivan G.

John Hodulik - UBS Timothy Horan - CIBC World Markets  David Barden - Banc of America Securities Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2006 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon. \nRon Lataille: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2006 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I am Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and CEO, and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication, and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained within this presentation and is also contained in our SEC filings which are available on our website.  This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the SEC rules. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on the same webpage as our presentation slides.  In early July, we filed an 8-K that contains some important information. In the 8-K filing, we provided un-audited historical consolidated financial information for the last five quarters, restated for the reclassification of Verizon Dominican and Puerto Rico Telephone as discontinued operations as a result of their impending sale. The income on discontinued operations of $119 million this quarter is part of our adjusted EPS. Also, we will no longer be reporting international as a separate segment.  The same 8-K filing also included pro forma combined and wireline financial results of operations for the last five quarters, reflecting our merger with MCI. You can readily obtain this information from our website.  Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I would like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings. Reported earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2006 were $0.55. On an adjusted basis, before the effects of special items, EPS was $0.64. The special items that make up the difference between reported and adjusted EPS are discussed in our earnings release and provided in reconciliation tables in the investor quarterly bulletin. Briefly, there are three special items which we are excluding from adjusted results: With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. \nDoreen A. Toben : Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that we had a strong quarter in terms of financial and operating performance. We are gaining revenue and earnings momentum and we have confidence that we will continue to make steady progress in all our businesses.  In wireless, we had another quarter of very strong profitable growth. We were strong in several key performance indicators -- customer growth, service, ARPU, churn, and margins. We have further demonstrated the sustainability of our results and continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition, particularly with our high quality retail customer base, which leads to higher margins.  We made solid progress in the wireline business. In telcom, we continue to position ourselves by investing in the platform for future growth.  We had another excellent quarter in broadband and video. In addition, aggressive cost control helped us offset the up-front costs of deploying new products.  We are making great progress in Verizon business. We had sequential revenue growth. We are seeing many encouraging signs in terms of improving trends. Our integration efforts are going well.  Overall, a very strong quarter. Let\u2019s turn now to slide four and look at some of the details.  Total revenues were up 26%, and net income was up 6%, compared with second quarter last year. A comparison that is favorably affected by the inclusion of MCI this year. On a pro forma basis, consolidated revenue growth was 2.3% year over year and also up 1.8% sequentially. Revenue increases were driven by growth in wireless, broadband and enterprise data services.  Strong cash expense controls resulted in operating margin expansion in the quarter.  Operating income increased 12.4% and operating income margins increased 160 basis points year over year.  These results include the effects of net pensions and OPEB, which amounted to $384 million in the second quarter, $77 million more than last year. Remember that we do not exclude the effects of amortization of intangibles from our adjusted results. You will recall us telling you last quarter that amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of MCI will result in approximately $210 million of annualized expense.  Looking at our cash flow and balance sheet, you see that we continue to have very strong cash generation. On a year-to-date basis, CFFO totaled $11.5 billion, which is $1.6 billion better than the first-half of last year. Capital spending was $8.3 billion for the first half, of which $5 billion is wireline and $3.2 billion is wireless. At the half-way point in the year, we are on track to meet our stated guidance for full-year cap-ex spending. Debt was $42.4 billion at June 30, and all our credit metrics remain strong.  Let\u2019s turn now to the wireline financials on slide 6. Starting with revenues, the encouraging news is positive sequential growth. We will review the drivers of this growth by market on the next chart.  Pro forma revenues were down 6.2% year over year, driven in part by continued and expected declines in the former MCI mass market business, which decreased $226 million, or 25.7% this quarter. Another cause of the decline was the absence of revenues from less strategic areas we have exited, like the logistics business. This is the last full quarter that we will see the effects of a large contract termination last summer.  The real story in wireline is our focus on expense controls and margin expansion, especially in light of increasing competition and the upward pressure on expenses from growth initiatives, particularly the fiber build. As you can see, on an all-in pro forma basis, second quarter cash expenses declined 6.7% year over year and 1% sequentially.  In telcom, year over year expense reductions were driven by headcount control, improved employee productivity, and ramping automation and self-service initiatives.  In Verizon business, headcount controls and reduction in access costs contributed to this decline.  Expenses related to FiOS increased both sequentially and year over year. All in, FiOS represented $0.07 of EPS dilution this quarter compared with $0.06 in the first quarter. Obviously we were able to more than offset expenses associated with the growth initiatives.  The set focus on cost management resulted in sequential operating income growth and margin expansion of 15% and 120 basis points respectively. If you exclude net pension and OPEB costs, the wireline operating income margin would be 12.5%.  We continue to see significant opportunities for additional cost savings in the wireline business. These opportunities are in addition to the synergy savings we have identified in Verizon business. We remain confident that wireline margins will expand and show sequential improvement as we go through the year.  The next chart gives us a closer look at wireline revenues by market. Consumer market revenues totaled $4.3 billion in the quarter. Revenues from the former MCI mass market business, which generated $582 million of that total declined 24% year over year and 6.6% sequentially.  Excluding the mass market effect reduces the consumer revenue decline rather dramatically. In fact, on a sequential basis, legacy Verizon revenues decreased only 0.4%, or $15 million, driven in large part to the success in broadband.  Looking ahead, we receive favorable regulatory pricing in a few states. These approved rate increases are worth about $100 million on an annualized basis and became effective in late second and early third quarter. In addition, we are looking at several other strategic pricing advantages in the second-half of this year that will increase revenues in the consumer market.  In the small-medium business market, revenues increased both year over year and sequentially. Again, revenues from the former MCI mass market, which totaled $96 million in the quarter, declined 15% year over year. Within this market, legacy Verizon business revenues grew 2% year over year and 2.4% sequentially.  Revenues in the enterprise business market, which represents a domestic retail portion of Verizon business, reported 1% sequential growth. As we will discuss shortly, total Verizon business revenues grew 1.6% sequentially. This is a very encouraging sign, and the first time we have seen sequential growth in quite some time.  Wireline wholesale, which includes both telcom and business wholesale revenues, increased 1.4% sequentially, driven by increased volumes and the domestic long-haul network.  Data is a growing percentage of our overall wireline revenues, now standing at approximately 31% of the total. Quarterly data revenues totaled $4 billion, representing nearly a 5% increase on a year-over-year pro forma basis and 3% sequentially. Within telcom, revenue growth is driven by consumer broadband, both DSL and FiOS, as well as a continued, healthy demand for wholesale services. As for Verizon business, data revenues totaled $2.5 billion, with approximately 30% of this revenue being IP related.  In Verizon business, as I said, we are focused on sequential improvement. Overall, in the first quarter since the formation of Verizon business, revenues grew 1.6% sequentially, which is very good progress in a very short period of time. The sequential improvement in enterprise business is a result of the continued traction and key products and better stability and growth in certain traditional services. Certain voice and private line pricing show early signs of stabilization, although some products are increasingly price competitive. Wholesale revenues were sequentially flat as improvements domestically were offset by some modest declines internationally.  Our focus within Verizon business is to increase revenues from strategic services. These include private IP, IP VPN, managed security, hosting, managed data network, and other internet services. Revenue from these services have been steadily growing and totaled more than $900 million in the second quarter, up 17% year over year. On a sequential basis, strategic service revenues were up 5.4%. We also intend to capitalize on growth opportunities by focusing on increasing market share penetration in the managed security and hosting markets.  We realized about $150 million in incremental synergies during the quarter, bringing our first half total to around $200 million. Most of these savings are driven by headcount reductions, sourcing synergies, network optimization, and traffic migration.  We expect to see a significant ramp-up in synergies in the second-half of 2006, particularly as we complete the migration of off-network voice and IP traffic onto our own network. We remain very confident that we will achieve at least the $550 million of targeted synergies this year.  Our integration spending is also on target. We have a number of system integration projects underway. We expect to see cost savings relating to these system integration activities later this year and into 2007 and beyond.  Let\u2019s turn now to telcom and start with a look at some customer metrics. As I said earlier, we continue to make great progress in broadband. With 440,000 net new broadband customers in this quarter, we now exceed 6.1 million broadband connections, with 1.6 million being added over the last three quarters, which is industry-leading.  Total access lines were down 7.4% compared with a year ago, and 1 million lower on a sequential quarterly basis. One-third of the 1 million net lines lost in the quarter were a combination of wholesale lines and former MCI mass market customers in region. That said, the retail residential line loss of 553,000 was higher than the past few quarters, due in part to the expected quarterly seasonality as well as increased competition.  If we broaden the consumer picture beyond access lines and including broadband and video customers, a metric we call revenue-generating units, or RGU\u2019s, you see that we are flat sequentially and actually up about 1% versus last year.  In addition to broadband growth, customer response to our freedom bundles has also been very positive. The number of total freedom customers has increased more than 40% in the past year alone. Our consumer freedom penetration is now nearly 22%, up from 16% at the start of the year.  I would also note that for legacy Verizon customers, the average revenue per household per month has increased more than 1% sequentially and year over year.  Within the telcom business, we remain focused and committed to our fiber initiatives, and we are making good progress in deploying FTTP, improving costs, increasing net adds, and increasing customer penetration.  As of mid-July, we have passed an additional 1.5 million homes, bringing the cumulative homes passed to 4.5 million. We are well on our way to reaching 6 million total homes passed by year-end.  As the scale of our deployment increases, we are seeing costs declining. We have taken and will continue to take actions which will result in improvements in the cost of pass and connect homes.  For example, we have renegotiated contractor rates and have implemented some pre-fabricated and pre-slicing work before going to connect homes. We are also realizing the benefits of lower fiber costs. Also, as many of you know, we just announced our GPON vendor selections. The adoption of GPON provides significant capacity improvement over DPON. This move to GPON will result in significant decreases in both current and future costs.  There are also some technology solutions which will make connecting homes a more efficient process. We recently introduced our new broadband home router, which is capable of providing connectivity to our FiOS network at speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. This router utilizes existing in-home wiring for broadband data and video signals.  Another technology, which should reduce installation time, is being developed by MOCA, or the Multimedia Over Co-ax Alliance. We hope to being using some of this technology as soon as this September.  As I previously indicated, as we gain experience and scale with FiOS, we will share this knowledge with you. To that end, we are planning FiOS briefing sessions within the next few months to further discuss these cost improvement efforts as well as other operating expense savings opportunities. In addition to adjusting FiOS economics, we will also cover our technology and marketing programs.  We continue to see a strong and growing customer response to both our data and video product offerings. As our fiber deployment continues and scale increases, we are really seeing FiOS data taking off. We now have a total of 375,000 FiOS data subscribers, having added 111,000 during this past quarter alone. To further illustrate our progress, net adds for the month of June were 25% higher than in the month of March.  Our total penetration across all markets now stands at 12%. The average penetration at the one-year mark is 15%. We calculate penetration based on the number of customers divided by the number of homes open for sale. We had 3.1 million homes open for sale at the end of June.  Speed is the winner in the broadband race. In key competitive markets, we have doubled the speed of entry-level FiOS data service to 10 megabits per second. We also offer 20 megabits. Both of these have 2 megabits upstream capability. We also recently introduced a 50 meg downstream and 5 meg upstream service in these markets. This is the fastest Internet connection speed in the country, and appeals to communications-intensive consumers, telecommuters, and small businesses.  As with DSL, we are finding FiOS data to be very retentive. FiOS churn is very low. In fact, it is similar to our wireless churn rate. This bodes well for us, as we continue to expand our video rollout and can offer more customers the triple play.  During the quarter, we made significant progress in gaining local video franchises, and now have secured more than 100 in total. We are currently offering FiOS TV in about 60 markets across seven states. We are seeing great initial acceptance by customers across our whole footprint, particularly in the more mature data markets.  Our average video penetration rates are 7% at the three-month mark and 10% after six months. 99% of our video customers choose a digital package. More than 60% have selected advanced set-top boxes with DVR\u2019s and/or high definition capabilities. About 80% of our FiOS video customers get all three services from us -- voice, data, and video. Our churn rates are very low, and our video ARPU has been strong, benchmarking well with the competition.  In addition to an extremely robust and competitive video offering, including some great sports content deals, in the month of June, we launched our first interactive television service call FiOS widgets. This is a simple application enabling one-button access to local weather and traffic.  Now we are going to offer our next interactive service, the home media DVR. This innovation combines access to video recordings from any set-top box in any room, a multi-room DVR with the ability to access through the set-top box any photos and music stored on your computer -- a media manager. Customer research shows exceptional interest in these applications.  This is just the beginning of many new, innovative and differentiated services we have planned with FiOS video. Needless to say, we are very pleased with our progress in FiOS data and video, and we are quite optimistic about our future prospects to gain market share.  The best way to summarize wireline is to say we are positioning ourselves for future growth. As we invest in the platform for future growth, we are making very good progress at preserving our core margins. It is imperative that we reduce our cost structures in areas unrelated to the fiber initiative. We are preserving core profitability by driving at least enough cost out of the business to offset the dilutive effects of our FiOS initiative, which we estimate to be between $0.28 and $0.30 on EPS in 2006.  We must also offset the effect of declines in our traditional voice product revenue stream. We have seen strong broadband net adds during this transition, which have helped stabilize and grow our RGU\u2019s.  In Verizon business, we are off to a great start. Customer receptivity to our management and sales teams have been excellent, and we are gaining share of spend with our enterprise customers. We saw sequential growth in revenues and are focused on sales of our strategic IP based services. The ability to offer integrated wireless solutions to business customers is providing another incremental revenue opportunity and we are positioning ourselves to be successful in this area.  We are also very committed to increasing efficiencies. I noted earlier that our integration efforts are going very well and the realization of synergy savings is on target. The bottom line here is we see wireline margin expansion opportunities and we are sharply focused on capturing those opportunities.  Let\u2019s move now to wireless. Verizon wireless continued to post industry-leading results with another quarter of outstanding metrics. A big highlight is service ARPU accretion, which was up year over year and also sequentially. As you know, we added another 1.8 million net new customers during the second quarter. Of note, all of these are retail customers, both consumer and business. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we added more than 1.5 million net retail customers. We believe we have the most retail customers in the industry. Our 52.6 million retail customers represents 96% of our total customer base of 54.8 million.  Retail has been a focus of ours for a long time. We server and manage these customers directly. They choose our brand. They know whose network they are on, and they are high-quality customers in terms of loyalty and lifetime revenue.  We are also the fastest growing U.S. wireless company in terms of absolute numbers of customers, having added 7.5 million new customers to our base in the past 12 months. Again, virtually all of these are retail -- very few are from our wholesale channels.  We also continued to set records for low churn, a key measure of customer loyalty. Total monthly churn of 1.13% was the lowest in the company\u2019s history, and we believe the lowest ever in the wireless industry for a major carrier. Churn among our retail post-paid customers was exceptional at only 0.87% -- another company and industry record.  There are more customers choosing and staying with Verizon branded service than any other wireless brand. Beyond delivering the best network, we continue to work hard at earning customers\u2019 loyalty. We recently announced plans to prorate early termination fees and to expand our worry-free guarantee beginning this fall. These moves are in keeping with our well-established track record of listening and making policy decisions based on customer needs.  Retail gross adds were sequentially higher, an increase of just under 3.5 million. Furthermore, 87% of our retail gross adds were post-paid. During the quarter, 75% of our retail post-paid gross adds came from our direct distribution channel. This is key, because we have found that customers who buy through our direct channel have lower churn and tend to return to us for services and upgrades.  At the same time, we continue to expand and diversify our indirect distribution channel, which includes individual agents and national retailers like Costco and Best Buy. In the second quarter, we also added our post-paid product line-up in some 1900 Wal-Mart stores nationwide. At present, we have 12,800 total doors in our indirect channel with a diversified product, distribution and geographic mix.  Taking advantage of new retail channels and models, both direct and with our indirect partners, has helped us maintain a high-quality base in our industry leading efficiency and profitability.  Let\u2019s turn now to the financials on chart 19. Total quarterly revenues, which are now in excess of $9 billion, grew 18% year over year. Sequentially, revenues were up $449 million. I said earlier that we were the fastest-growing U.S. wireless company in terms of customer additions. Importantly, this growth was accompanied by continued industry best margins and profitability. The sustainability of our margins is driven by the quality of our customer mix, our efficient cost structure, and economies of scale. EBITDA grew to $3.6 billion, a sequential improvement of 5.2%. The quarterly EBITDA margin was 44.4%, up from 43% a year ago. Taking a closer look at revenues, growth in service revenues was again driven by increased data usage and the high-quality customer profile of new adds. Expanding data revenues are more than covering reductions in voice revenues per user. Total service ARPU of $49.71 increased both sequentially and year over year, as did retail service ARPU of $50.34.  Data revenue accounted for nearly 13% of service revenue. It was not long ago that we talked about data as a $1 billion business annualized. Now, data revenues are generating $1 billion per quarter.  Data contributed $6.40 of ARPU, up almost $3 year over year and $0.82 sequentially. More than half of our retail customers are data users, and 10 million of them have broadband devices. As we have said many times, the key to our success in wireless data is our commitment to investing in the network.  Our lineup of broadband devices for business is industry-leading. We continue to see strong up-take from business customers on broadband access cards, embedded laptops, and PDA\u2019s.  In the consumer space, our customers exchange more than $12 billion text messages this quarter. We see a significant opportunity for growth in our V Cast and V Cast Music customers. Yesterday you may have seen our announcement of the music-centric chocolate phone from LG -- ours exclusively in the U.S. We are very excited about this device, which is wildly popular internationally. In all, we now have 9 phones for V Cast Music, many of which also include VZ navigator software.  To summarize, we have a long track record of consistent, sustained performance. This was the 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth, the eighth consecutive quarter that the company added more than $1.5 million retail customers, the sixth consecutive quarter of EBITDA margins of greater than 40%, and the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in gross adds, and churn, the best proof point of network reliability, has been 1.5% or below for more than two years. We attribute this record of consistency to three key drivers -- network quality, industry-leading loyalty, and cost efficiency.  In closing, I would summarize this way -- again, our financial and operating performance for both the second quarter and first-half of 2006 were strong. In fact, we saw better-than-expected sequential growth. We are also on target to meet our full-year guidance. Our growth initiatives are gaining momentum, and we have confidence that we will continue to make steady progress in all our businesses.  Wireless continued to surpass its own milestones for growth, profitability and customer churn, reinforcing its industry lead. The transformation to broadband continues, with another strong quarter of customer acceptance of DSL, and particularly FiOS products. Verizon business integration plans are going well, and we are building momentum. We expect to continue seeing sequential improvement in both revenues and expenses as we move through the year.  On the revenue and cost side, we continue to see significant opportunities to drive margin expansion. We know how to control expenses and we have an intense focus on reducing costs.  Along with operational execution, we continue to increase our flexibility in returning value to our shareowners. The Verizon information services divestiture is on schedule to be completed this year. During the quarter, we accelerated our share buybacks, repurchasing an additional 600 million. This means we have already met our full-year target of 1 billion in just six months. We plan to continue our share buyback program and are targeting another 500 million in repurchases over the remainder of the year.  With that, I will turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Ivan and Doreen are now ready for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeff Halpern of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. \nJeff Halpern - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.: Two questions -- first, for Ivan: last week, Verizon wireless obviously pre-announced its strong subscriber numbers. Concurrently, Vodafone\u2019s -- some of their results. Your stock did not react, despite very strong movements from some in your peer group, and it seems to me that was in no small part a result of Arun making statements at his analyst meeting about how he would be willing to sell you his stake in Verizon wireless if you were only willing to pay a fair price.  I was wondering, Ivan, if you could just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the ownership structure now, and then any perceived financial benefits you think might accrue to you if you owned all of it, and would those make you willing to pay more than the normal multiple? Secondly for Doreen, in a press release last week, on the GPON announcement, in the bottom of the press release there was some qualitative statements about the cost savings of fiber versus legacy copper infrastructure. In the past you have given us some guidance on that subject, as far as what you are seeing and a more quantitative nature. Could you be a little bit more specific about the areas you are seeing operational expense savings from fiber? Thank you. \nDoreen A. Toben : I am going to go first, if that is okay. Doing the GPON question first, I think what we would suggest, and actually I think we have seen one or two analysts estimate it pretty accurately, that we expect GPON will save us about $100 per home connected. Also, as we potentially get increased -- or decreased, I should say, pricing on BPON, we actually think we will get $100 from a BPON perspective as well for home connected.  I went through in the script some of the other things that we are seeing, as far as we have renegotiated contractor rates. We are doing some pre-fab work before we do that. We talked about MOCA. I will give you anecdotally something that we have looked at. We have looked at a group of customers that have trouble, a fair amount of troubles say over a 90-day period, and for those customers, they may have had 130 troubles over the past 90 days. After we migrate them to fiber, they go down to 14. So we are seeing an 80% to 90% reduction in trouble reports for those customers that we were seeing outside plant, and particular troubles with.  Our anecdotal evidence continues to be good. We did mention in the previous text that we will have some briefing sessions, which I know everybody has been interested in to go through even more details for you in the not-too-distant future. \nIvan G. Seidenberg: Jeff, on the Vodafone front, two parts to your question. The first one is when the net adds were released last week, there were some reports that indicated they thought the 1.8 million net adds would come at a cost to EBITDA margin, which is not the case, so hopefully people now when they see the whole picture, they will have a more positive view of the superior performance of 1.8 net adds.  Also, Arun was in New York last week and he and I sat down and we talked. So I think what is probably good for investors to understand is I think I can provide some clarity about what this whole partnership thing will look like. So very quickly, what Arun communicated to us was that Vodafone was extremely pleased with their position in the partnership. The operating agreement between the two of us is strong, is sustainable, it has stood the test of time over these five or six years, and their view is that the creation of value available to them over the next several years is far greater than any strategy that they might have to exit the partnership.  He reiterated that was exactly the position of Sir John Bond, his new chairman, and for all practical purposes I had the chance to meet John Bond also within the last month or so, and that is exactly the situation.  As we said before, the whole idea here is that this is a Vodafone-driven issue. If they feel like they want to stay in the partnership, that is their right and we frankly believe that is a good position for them to be in, and it is okay with us.  I had a chance then to sit down with Arun and go over what we thought was what we had communicated to them over the past year or so, what our operating philosophy would be over the next four or five years, and that would be that we are going to still run the business to seek market share growth, profitable growth. We are going to maintain margins in the low- to mid-40\u2019s. We are going to invest in new technologies. We are going to acquire spectrum when and where we need it. We are going to de-lever the business and basically continue to improve the financial metrics of the business over the next several years.  Arun, who goes to all the board meetings and is very active in it, said \u201cIvan, that is exactly what we have agreed to do and so let\u2019s both make sure that we clarify to our respective investors that at this point in time, there really is not much reason for people to speculate over any change in the whole arrangement between the two companies.\u201d So Jeff, as far as I am concerned, I think the issue here is pretty much resolved over the next several years. Unless there is a specific change on the part of Vodafone\u2019s thinking, I think we now have clarity over the sustainability of the partnership. We will focus on running a great business. Both sets of shareholders will understand how we intend to drive value in the company. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Jeff. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Good morning. Two quick ones for you. First, on the access line losses, the losses continue to accelerate, and obviously there is a number of cross currents. Could you comment on, I guess a negative note, increasing competition you are seeing from cable in your markets?  Secondly, obviously FiOS is I think a little bit ahead of where we thought it would be in terms of penetration. Can you comment on how you see the two of those coming together and potentially slowing access line losses over time, and essentially what kind of trends you are seeing in markets where you have FiOS? Secondly, wireless ARPU, we were surprised at the ARPU growth there. Is this the beginning of a trend that we could see for the rest of the year and into next year, and just how you see data penetration continuing as EBDO start to gain some traction?\nDoreen A. Toben : I will start with the access lines. I think it is fair to say that given the increased technology substitution, that we would continue to see access line continue to go down. I think you know that we are much more focused these days on RGU\u2019s, of which we did see some growth in the quarter. With increasing success with our broadband products, we think that the RGU\u2019s will have growth and we will see a different trend in the revenues.  Having said that, it would be fair to say, especially with the new Comcast turn-ups, that we did see increased competition in those areas that Comcast turned up.  Looking at the FiOS piece of it, obviously the reason we are doing FiOS is to decelerate the access line reduction. We have looked at, on a central office by central office basis to see where we have FiOS, has the trend changed. In general, I would say that is the case where you see a slowing. We also see obviously a higher FiOS ARPU than we do for the access lines.  It is early. We are tracking it real closely, and I do not want to give you a definitive answer, but it is trending in the right place where we have FiOS.  On the ARPU, obviously as you know, ARPU is a function of how much capital do you put in the ground and in all of your new products. We did see, we think this was great news, sequential plus year-over-year accretion here, obviously driven by the data component of it.  I would say that our plan would be to continue to see over the planning period, I am not going to be as specific as to say each Q, but over the planning period, we do think that the data, because of EBDO and the V Cast Music and what not, is going to allow us to have ARPU accretion. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Tim Horan of CIBC. Please go ahead with your question. \nTimothy Horan - CIBC World Markets : Good morning. Three questions, if you don\u2019t mind. Ivan, maybe you can talk on the strategic front. Does this change -- the Vodafone issues, does that change what you are going to do with directories and maybe rural lines and maybe where you are at on the leverage side? Two fundamental questions. Doreen, on the ARPU side, you definitely outperformed and the results are pretty incredible. Other countries around the world that have been at this level of data penetration have seen ARPU\u2019s kind of flatten out. Is there some reason you think the U.S. might be different? I have some thoughts on that, but just your thoughts.  Third, on FiOS, it clearly is the best product on video and data when you are in these markets. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about your most mature markets, where you are at in penetration and why would you not ultimately get more like 50% penetration, or at least 50% market share on the video side? Thank you. \nIvan G. Seidenberg: I will take a cut at some of these. On the strategic front, as we have said all along, the transactions to sell international properties as well as to spin the VIS property, or spin or sell it, was never exclusively driven by any transaction with Vodafone. We think they would share all the friendly transactions that will help us in different ways return value to shareholders. We think it is a significant de-leveraging issue with the directories business, and we think we can deploy the capital better, and by selling international properties in a way to do that.  So we are going to proceed with those full speed ahead as we have committed, and we think that when you look at our company, toward the end of this year and into next year, our profile changes. Doreen made the key point that all three of our units made some contribution to value creation of this quarter, sequential growth in the business and certainly both sequential and year over year in wireless and significant new momentum developed in FiOS. I think we feel good about the strategic positioning of the whole company and we will continue down that track.  As far as any other activities, we always keep our eyes open, but there is nothing to report at this point.  The ARPU issue, we talk a lot about this. Doreen probably has a better answer than I would, but from an operating standpoint, when we sit around and talk about ARPU, we basically are talking about making the capital investments, investing in our distribution, investing in our applications, training our people, and in effect running an overall business that drives the quality of the customer we get. Remember we have a very high percentage of post-paid customers, which I think helps in the issue of ARPU because it drives a higher quality experience for both our customers and for the business. So we think we have a formula that has worked for us and we are going to continue to work it. I believe that it will lead to continued success down this path.  Again, as Doreen said, over the planning period, it has been important to us to develop in effect a business model that drives at not only growth in net adds but growth in profitability and to do that, you need to keep your eye on ARPU.  The last point about FiOS, I think our earnings release shows that, and I think Doreen said it in her remarks, that after 9 months, we are looking at 12% penetration in FiOS. In markets that we have been in a little bit longer, the penetration is higher. Could we go higher? The answer to that is I expect it to, and if we drive our people to make it go higher, at this point, our experience is what it is, so we are not going to come off the trends that we have, but we believe if we continue to do the things we are doing, we have the chance to continually beat the progress we have been making so far. We are feeling good about that.  What we did not talk about this release is that we are also in 50 markets providing video, and we are seeing some anecdotal evidence, just like we saw in data, that the take-rates are pretty good and that the ARPU\u2019s associated with that are competitive. As we get more critical mass and scale, we will be able to do the same thing for you with video that we have done with data, and that is provide a little bit more transparency in the results as we get a bigger footprint in the video market. \nDoreen A. Toben : The only thing I would add, Tim, is if you look at the data in Europe versus the U.S., Europe is primarily driven by SMF, and if you look here at our data ARPU, SMF, while a good piece and growing quickly, all the new services are really growing a lot more, so I think that gives us an opportunity that is different from over there.  I would just add on, the video and data ARPU in FiOS, if you look at some of our mature markets, we are significantly higher than what we are showing you, but at this point we are, from a modeling standpoint, being conservative. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question is from David Barden of Banc of America. \nDavid Barden - Banc of America Securities: Good morning. First question I just wanted to hit Doreen on some of the FiOS growth, revisiting some of your prior comments in the past that you have been seeing a one-third conversion rate on DSL to FiOS, and that the rest of the FiOS growth was incremental.  It does look, if you subtract our FiOS from the combined broadband subscriber growth that it would suggest maybe some relatively faster DSL trajectory on the downside than we have seen from some of your counterparts in the [inaudible] community. I was wondering if you could talk about how you are thinking about DSL growth versus FiOS growth substitutions, strategically how you are trying to make sure this is additional as opposed to substitutive.  Second, if I could just ask more on the MCI enterprise business side, the color on the pricing commentary, both the retail and the wholesale level, especially how the competitive environment is shaping up there.  Last, if I could just quick, obviously it is not core business, but just on the revenue side in the directories year over year, it does seem it is a bit of a [inaudible] at the Verizon information services business with the high-single digit negative growth versus flat to positive growth at other directories that are out there. If you could just comment on that. Thank you. \nDoreen A. Toben : On the directory one, there was a large piece that was international in the prior Q, so if you actually adjusted that out, the number is more like 4% or 5% down, so it is significantly different, so there was a one-time issue in that particular one.  On the FiOS, it is still maybe a 30%-ish conversion from DSL to FiOS. I would suggest that we are not seeing a slowdown in DSL at all -- really, at all. What we are doing in those areas where we have FiOS is obviously heavily promoting FiOS as opposed to DSL, but we are absolutely not seeing a slowdown in the DSL numbers. I think if you look at the absolute number, this was the best second quarter that we have had in DSL subs, so that has been really strong.  On the enterprise side, I do not know if I could do too much more than what we have told you. I think the pricing is what we expected at this point. We have not seen any acceleration of the discounting of in the legacy or core services, which I think is good. We think the sales of the next-gen, which are obviously much more profitable, are doing well. We are seeing some more increased competition on what I call the next generation, but I think we would say, I would use the word encouraged by the stabilization of the pricing in total.  I think you have seen over the past that where MCI competed with AT&T obviously did well, and think we will continue to do well from a pricing perspective next to those competitors. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. \nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter : Good morning. Thanks for the additional FiOS disclosure this quarter. It is very helpful.  You said that our speed wins in the broadband wars. It looks like you are out about 10% of your homes have FiOS data available to them now. Can you talk about the rest of the homes, the ones that have DSL or will be getting FiOS two, three, four years from now? Where are we in terms of the speeds that are available? How do you bridge the gap from today to when they get the FiOS product? Can you also, just on the directories, come back to your thoughts on spin versus sale and on timing of that? Thank you. \nIvan G. Seidenberg: Simon, on the issue of FiOS, I remember that our longer term plan on FiOS is to perhaps cover between 60% and 70% of the lines, and we do that over a several year period. We are also obviously putting more fiber in the plant, so we are able to squeeze a little bit more capacity out of DSL.  The way I see it from an operating standpoint is over the course of the next three or four or five years, technologically we will see some improvements that will probably let us, for the same spend, cover more of our lines with respect to our FiOS coverage, because there is going to be technological improvements over the course of the next three, four, five years.  So the short answer to your question is that we will improve DSL plants, so we will get speeds close to 3-meg and 6-meg, and then we will be able to further penetrate with technological improvements the FiOS build. To me, there is not a big gap here. The real trick is that the speed -- customers will be demanding the speed and I believe we will see really big uptakes in FiOS. If we can actually accelerate beyond what our business model metrics are for FiOS because there is a chance to accelerate that where it would be appropriate to do that.  On the spin versus sale on VIS, there really is not anything to report. I think Doreen and her team and John Diercksen and his team are working through this. Our assumptions all along was that we believe, at least as it has been explained to me, and what we tell the board, is that a spin is probably the more financially prudent move for us to make, but we have not stopped looking at whether or not a sale would be appropriate.  If there is some transaction that somebody can invent that would make it worthwhile for us to reconsider that, we would, but we started down the path of a spin. We expect to finish it by the end of the year, but we will always keep an open mind as to other forms. Our bias is that we think the spin is probably going to be the format that we move ahead with this transaction. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Simon. Operator, I would like to turn the call over now to Ivan Seidenberg for some concluding remarks. \nIvan G. Seidenberg: I thank everyone for taking the time this morning. I just have a few points. Hopefully when you remember the first quarter conference call that we had, we talked about a changing perspective for our company, which was one of really focusing on organic growth, improving revenues, expanding margins and generating cash flow. It has always been an issue for us as people look at our company as to whether or not the broadband build-out was chewing up so much capital that it was distracting from generating significant value long-term.  We see this quarter as kind of a little pivot. What we see is contributions in different ways from all three of our network-based businesses, clearly superior performance in wireless, which builds off of all of the investments and distribution and culture and product innovations that they have, but also really shows the power of the EBDO network and all of the innovation that comes from all of the new handsets. More than half the handsets out there are data-equipped at this point. You just saw all the significant announcements we made in the last couple of days with the new chocolate phone, which is the hottest selling item in Europe, which we are clear will be a very hot seller here in the next several months for us.  If you look at the business, as Doreen said, we are very encouraged by the fact that we are able to see some sequential growth. We are taking all the cost out, extracting the synergies, improving the systems, but at the same time, in the merger transaction, we watch people really focused on generating new growth for the business, which I expect to continue on the track and continue to do better as we go into the end of this year and into \u201907.  In the telco, if there was one point on the call I probably would have like to have spent another second or two on it would be the fact that yes, we had year over year revenue decline and yes, we saw continued substitution of access lines for new technology, but the two counters to that is we had probably the strongest expense control we have had in a while. If you basically take away the dilution that comes from FiOS, we had very good performance in terms of maintaining EBITDA margins in the rest of the business. So our business model now begins to look clear, that we will take the cost out to keep the margins flat, and as FiOS continues to get healthy, you can see that we return the telco portion of the business to a business model that when you extrapolate out all the trends that we begin to see here, that we feel comfortable that we are in a position over the next several months to show good value creation.  I think Doreen mentioned this, that over the course of the next four to six weeks or so, we will invite several of you in for briefings and we will have discussions about FiOS and give you an even more color about how the project is going.  I think we are a point, second quarter \u201906, where both our experience set and our confidence level is such that we are in a position to share a lot more of the historical information about it, which will give you a chance to understand how the business scales as we go forward.  On the corporate side, we are buying back shares. We exceeded our annual target. We will continue the program. We are working on the VIS spin and the international sales, so we feel we are in a really good position as we head into the second-half of the year and into 2007 to figure out really clever ways and very innovative ways to drive value for the shareholder.  So for us, this is not the usual quarter because we see this as a pivot and we can look ahead and see a lot more daylight than we have seen in the past couple of quarters, so thank you very much. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Ivan, and thank you everybody for joining our call today. That concludes our second quarter earnings release call.

You should also be advised that information about our opening balance sheet adjustments, as a result of the MCI merger transaction, will be part of our 10Q.  Before turning the call over to Doreen for her review of our results, I would like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings. Reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2006 were $0.56. On an adjusted basis, before the effects of special items, EPS was $0.60. The special items that make up the $0.04 difference between reported and adjusted EPS are discussed in our earnings release and provided in reconciliation tabled in the investor quarterly bulletin.  Briefly, there are four special items, each of which represents a $0.01 charge to earnings which we are excluding from adjusted results; after-tax charges of $16 million associated with the redemption of the former MCI notes; $28 million of after-tax charges for relocation and other costs related to our move to the Verizon centre; $35 million after-tax for merger integration costs, primarily re-branding; and lastly, a $42 million cumulative effect of a change in accounting for share-based compensation payments.  As part of the acquisition of MCI, we established an opening balance sheet value associated with intangible assets, namely customer lists, which are amortized on a monthly basis. Annualized, this will result in approximately $210 million of expense, or about $52 million per quarter.  Consistent with our past practices, we will not be excluding the effects of this amortization from our adjusted results. With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. \nDoreen Toben: Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Let me summarize our first quarter by saying that across all our operations, we have never been more focused on executing our strategies and delivering results. Our financial performance for the quarter was on target with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $0.60, we generated solid cash flows, and our integration efforts to date are going well, with targeted synergy savings ahead of plan. As I previously told you, 2006 quarterly earnings would not be spread evenly throughout the year. We expected the first quarter to be the lowest, with earnings ramping more in the second half of this year for two principal reasons: expected improvements in Verizon business and increased synergy savings.  We reported strong operating metrics in key growth areas, namely wireless and broadband. Along with our operating focus, we continue to increase our flexibility in returning value to our owners. The Verizon information services divestiture is on schedule to be completed this year.  In early April, we entered into agreements to sell our remaining Latin American assets for approximately $3.7 billion. We repurchased about $400 million of stock during the quarter, as part of the $1 billion we intend to buy back this year.  Let\u2019s look at some of the details. Our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter were $22.7 billion. Revenues in the first quarter last year were $18 billion. On a pro forma basis, which adds the former MCI results to 2005, and helps put results on a comparable basis for full quarter, revenues would be $23 billion this quarter compared with $22.3 billion a year ago, or 3.1% growth. This increase was driven primarily by growth in wireless, broadband and data services.  I would also note that international revenues increased this quarter primarily due to the sale of publication rights at TRTC. This sale, which amounted to $167 million, recognized royalties we would have received in future periods. These increases were offset by:  Next, let\u2019s take a look at cash expenses, operating income, and margins excluding special items. For purposes of this discussion, I\u2019m also excluding net pensions and OPEB costs. Adjusted cash expenses were $14.6 billion this quarter compared with $10.9 billion last year. On a pro-forma basis, adjusted cash expenses were $14.8 billion compared with $14.7 billion last year, an increase of 0.8%.  Increase in wireless cash expenses due to growth were offset in large part by decreases in Wireline. Adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion is $694 million higher than a year ago. Operating income margins were 19.2% this quarter, compared with 20.4% in the first quarter last year. On a pro-forma basis, adjusted operating income would have been $4.4 billion this quarter versus $3.8 billion last year, an increase of $531 million, or 13.9%. Operating income margins would have been 19%, a 180 basis point improvement over 17.2% margins a year ago.  Slide 6 highlights our cash flows, debt, and capital expenditures. We continue to generate very strong cash flows with $6.1 billion in the first quarter, which is $2.1 billion higher than first quarter last year. This large increase is the result of several factors. First quarter last year included higher dividend distributions to Vodafone. Last year we made higher pension contributions during the first quarter, and in addition, we paid income taxes during the first quarter of 2005 related to the sale of our Canadian assets.  Capital spending was $4.1 billion in first quarter, of which $2.4 billion is wireline and $1.6 billion is wireless.  The $472 million year over year increase is due primarily to the inclusion of MCI this quarter. Debt increased to $43.1 billion, primarily as the result of additional debt assumed in the MCI acquisition. During the quarter, we redeemed the MCI debt, which will result in interest expense savings of approximately $190 million in 2006.  Net debt is $41.8 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $38.2 billion at the end of the year. Lastly, our credit metrics remain strong.  Let\u2019s move to Wireline. Results are pretty much as expected for revenues and margins. As I said earlier, we expect to see improvements in these areas as we move through the year. On slide 7, you can see continued customer growth, particularly in broadband and freedom packages. We continue to make great progress in broadband. In the last six months, we have added 1.2 million broadband customers, which was industry leading. With less than 15% penetration of retail access lines, we see lots of headroom for more and more broadband customer growth.  When you look at the trend of revenue generating units, or RGU\u2019s, that is the combination of retail residential access lines, broadband connections, and video subscribers. We have seen improvement over the last two quarters. We have taken some specific steps and established targets to accelerate improvement, particularly in the consumer market.  For example, we introduced new freedom plans and pricing to respond to the competitive marketplace. As a result, we saw a significant increase in freedom customers. We signed up about 1.6 million new freedom customers in the last 12 months, about half of these in the past quarter alone.  In addition to simulating new customer subscriptions, this action has also helped customer retention and increased traditional in-region long distance subscriber counts. We have added 346,000 new LD lines this quarter. This does not include any of the former MCI LD lines.  Even with these actions, consumer ARPU for legacy Verizon was still up 2% year over year, and down only about 1% sequentially. We saw some improvement in the retail residential line losses in the first quarter. We have seen two quarters in a row in which broadband net adds have exceeded the declines in lines. We\u2019re confident these steps and some additional actions we have planned will result in stronger consumer metrics.  Let\u2019s take a look at Wireline revenues. Revenues for the first quarter were $12.5 billion. In the same quarter last year, revenues were $9.4 billion. On a pro-forma basis, revenues would be $12.7 billion this quarter, compared with $13.6 billion a year ago, or a decline of 6.8%.  Let\u2019s take a look at wireline revenues by market. The consumer market includes Verizon\u2019s local, LD, DSL, FiOS Data, and Video, and the former MCI consumer local and LD businesses. Revenues for the first quarter totaled $4.3 billion, compared with $3.8 billion last year. On a pro-forma basis, revenues declined $280 million, or 6.1%. As expected, a large portion of this decline relates to legacy MCI local and long distance business.  From a strategic perspective, we have no intentions to actively retain these out-of-region customers. As expected, traditional voice products also declined. These reductions are offset in part by revenues from broadband, which increased significantly compared with the first quarter of 2005.  The former MCI mass market revenues declined 22%. In the small- and medium-sized business market, revenues totaled $1.4 billion in the first quarter. On a pro-forma basis, revenue growth was flat. The improvement in business DSL and freedom packages that we saw this quarter should help customer retention and provide opportunities for growth in the future quarters.  Looking at Enterprise business, which includes the domestic retail Enterprise customers of both MCI and Verizon, revenues were $3.4 billion for the first quarter of this year. on a pro-forma basis, revenues were down about 5.4%. As expected, traditional voice and non-IP circuit switch data services have declined, although we are seeing some very early positive signs of growth in certain strategic products, such as managed network data services and other IP related services.  Wholesale revenues, which include former Verizon wholesale carrier and local MCI wholesale, were $2.1 billion in the first quarter. On a pro-forma basis, revenues were down 3.5%, due primarily to declines in local wholesale, as well as volume declines in leasing long-haul capacity.  Data is a growing percentage of our overall Wireline revenues now standing at approximately 30% of total. Data revenues totaled $3.9 billion in the first quarter of 2006, of which $3.6 billion is data transport. On a pro-forma basis, data revenues were up 4% as we continue to see growing demand for high-cap, high-speed data circuits.  With Verizon business, data revenues totaled more than $2.4 billion, and approximately 30% of this revenue is IP related.  Let\u2019s take a look at Wireline cash expense and operating income margin, excluding special items. Once again, for the purposes of this discussion, I\u2019m also excluding net pensions and OPEB costs.  On a pro-forma basis, cash expenses were $583 million, or 6.2% less than a year ago. Reductions in access costs contributed to this decline, due to lower volumes, a more favorable mix for international and wholesale, and an increase in on-net traffic. In fact, our plans are to reduce access costs this year by $1 billion.  There are a number of other factors contributing to the decline in expenses: FiOS expenses increased in the quarter. FiOS represented $0.06 of EPS dilution this quarter. Traditional Telco margins increased this quarter compared with fourth quarter last year.  We see significant opportunities for additional cost-savings in addition to merger synergies, and we are confident that the Wireline margins will expand as we go through the year.  We officially launched Verizon business at the end of January, and we\u2019re seeing a fast operational start. Our integration efforts are going well, with targeted synergy savings ahead of plan. In fact, we realized about $50 million in synergies in the first quarter. We expect to see a significant ramp-up in synergies in the second half of 2006, particularly as we complete the migration of off-network voice and IP traffic onto Verizon\u2019s networks. This process is well underway already. You can see the first half, second half targets on slide 12.  As far as force reduction efforts are concerned, we are ahead of plan at the end of first quarter. We are at about one-third of our total force reduction target for the year. Most of this headcount came off the payroll at the end of March, so we\u2019ll see related cost-savings in the second quarter.  I remain confident that we will exceed the $550 million of targeted synergies for the full year.  Most of our integration costs incurred to date have been for rebranding, which I\u2019m sure you have seen over the last couple of months. We also incurred some integration costs for systems integration initiatives, which are progressing well and are on track. We expect to see cost-savings from systems integration activities later this year.  We are aggressively inter-connecting the Verizon and MCI Enterprise network. We recently announced that we have the largest ultra long-haul network in the United States. We also have an expansive global presence. Verizon business now operates the world\u2019s largest wholly-owned facilities based global network.  As far as market opportunities, both global and domestic, we see continued demand for IP-based applications, managed services, and wireless integration, driving growth potential. Our focus is to increase revenues from strategic services, which include private IP, IPVPN, managed security, hosting, managed data network, and other internet services.  As you can see on slide 13, revenues from these services totaled $890 million in the first quarter, representing an increase of about 18% year over year. We intent to lead the shift to IP services and are out front, continuing to build momentum in this area.  During the quarter, we launched an integrated wireless and wireline offering for business customers that combines the power of the nation\u2019s most reliable wireless network and the Verizon business IP network. We expanded Ethernet and wireless EVDO to private IP services, and we have enhanced our voice portfolio, introducing more choice and flexibility.  We also intend to capitalize on growth opportunities by focusing on growing market share penetration in the managed security and hosting markets. Success through continued growth in these areas is vital to offsetting expected declines from our traditional core business.  It\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that customers want higher bandwidth and higher speeds. As you know, our long-term strategy for meeting these bandwidth requirements is fiber to the premise, and our investment dollars are focused on this initiative. We continue to see a strong and growing customer response to our FiOS data product offerings.  Looking at the penetration for FiOS data on slide 14, we are ahead of plan. We are seeing very good customer acceptance and consistent monthly penetration gains. In market grow, we have been selling FiOS data for at least six months. The average penetration at the six-month mark for each was 9%. The corresponding penetration rates at the nine- and twelve-month mark are 12% and 17% respectively. These markets are spread throughout our footprint, and compete with all the major cable players.  These early penetration rates indicate that we are well on our way to achieving our goal of 30% penetration in five years.  In video, we have acquired 57 franchises to date, and are open for sale in select markets in seven different states. We are seeing great initial acceptance by customers across our whole footprint, particularly in the more mature data markets. We have now achieved a 12% penetration in Texas, 10% in Florida, and 9% in Virginia -- quite impressive numbers.  In Temple Terrace, Florida, we have 16% penetration. In Herndon, Virginia, it is 10% in less than four months time. In Massapequa Park on Long Island, we have achieved 6.5% in just three months time.  More than 60% of our video customers have selected advanced desktop boxes, with either digital video records, high-definition or both. This is a good indication of future potential as it gives these customers the capability to fully participate in our advanced service offerings. Virtually all of our video customers choose a digital package.  Obviously, a large percentage of our video customers were already very satisfied FiOS data users, anxious to take all three services from us -- voice, data, and video. This is important. It\u2019s a great pull-through on FiOS data we are seeing as customers decide to take our video service. One out of every two new to FiOS video subscribers also make the decision to get all three services from us when they place their order. As a result, approximately 80% of our video customers are triple-play customers.  We are experiencing very low churn with these customers. In addition, we benchmark quite well in terms of ARPU. As we move forward, we expect to continually enhance our video products and differentiate it even more with convert capabilities, so we are off to a strong start.  Let\u2019s move now to Wireless. Verizon Wireless continues to surpass its own industry performance milestones with record net adds and profitability for our first quarter, and the lowest churn ever recorded by a major carrier. This was:  Verizon Wireless added 1.7 million net new customers in the first quarter 2006. More than 1.6 million of these were retail. Only 59,000 were reseller customers.  We posted more retail net adds than any other carrier, which means more people buy the Verizon brand than any other.  We now have 53 million customers nationwide, an increase of 16.7% since the first quarter last year. We have a high-quality customer base with about 96% retail, and only 4% reseller. We are the fastest-growing U.S. wireless company in terms of net adds, with 7.6 million new customers in the last 12 months alone.  We continued to set records for low churn, a key measure of customer loyalty, with total monthly churn of 1.18% for the first quarter 2006, the lowest in the company\u2019s history and the lowest ever in the wireless industry.  Churn among the company\u2019s retail post-paid customers was exceptional, at only 0.92%, another company and industry record. These results show that it really is the network and our award-winning call quality, reliability, and the overall best experience in wireless that attracts and retains customers.  The strength of the wireless brand in the marketplace is driven by our premier wireless network. The best proof points for network reliability is churn.  Slide 18 shows our very strong revenue growth trends over the past five quarters. Total revenues grew 18.8%. Service revenue was up $1.1 billion, or 16% compared with first quarter last year, driven by increasing data usage and the high quality customer profile of new adds. As I said, most are retail net adds.  Service ARPU was $48.67, down only 0.7% versus last year, as compared with a 1.9% year over year decline in the fourth quarter.  Moving to wireless data, data revenue accounted for nearly 11.5% of first quarter service revenue. Data contributed $5.58 of ARPU, up from $4.85 last quarter -- very strong sequential growth. More than half of our retail customers are data users, up 47% since this time a year ago. Our data usage results for the first quarter illustrate how popular our data services are: 9.6 billion text messages, 171 million picture and video messages, and nearly 45 million downloads of games, ringtones and ring-back tones.  The key to our success in wireless data is our commitment to investing in the network. Verizon Wireless was the first carrier to build a nationwide wireless broadband network, and we have the most experience in delivering broadband services.  Our EBDO network gives us extensive broadband coverage coast to coast. We continue to see strong uptake from business customers on broadband access cards and TDA\u2019s. Embedded laptops from major manufacturers are also contributing to the steady growth in broadband usage.  Our superior broadband network enables product innovation for consumers as well. Examples of this innovation are V CAST, the first consumer wireless multimedia service, and V CAST Music, the world\u2019s most comprehensive wireless music service. Customers can transfer their own music to their phones at no charge, download directly to their phones or PC, and identify music while it\u2019s playing. We now have a music library of 1 million songs and growing.  We\u2019re really just at the beginning of the wireless broadband revolution, and we have the network and products to take significant advantage of this growth trend. Of course, growth is only part of the Verizon Wireless story.  We continue to grow with increasing profitability as our operating income margin for the first quarter was 24%. Quarterly EBITDA margins were 44.5%, up from 41% in the first quarter last year. Our EBITDA was $3 billion or more for each of the last four quarters. Our margin expansion is organic, it\u2019s driven by our revenue growth, customer mix, and economies of scale. Cash expense per subscriber remained low at just under $27, down 6.6% from one year ago.  Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader in cost efficiency. Our low-cost structure is the result of many efficiencies in the business, including but not limited to, our distribution channel mix. During the first quarter, about 73% of our retail growth adds came from our direct distribution channels. Despite not doing business with Radio Shack, gross adds increased to 3.5 million, which is 120,000 higher than first quarter a year ago.  We have found the customers who buy through our direct channels have lower churn. They also come to our stores for service and upgrades. Unlike customers from resellers or MVNO\u2019s, these customers and those from our indirect channel, which I\u2019ll talk about next, are our customers. They are buying the Verizon Wireless brand. We have a relationship with them -- a relationship that we impact directly and work hard to preserve.  At the same time, we continue to expand and diversify our indirect distribution channel, which includes individual agents and national resellers such as Costco and Best Buy. During the first quarter, we also added Wal-Mart to our distribution mix to sell a pre-paid product.  To date, we have more than 12,000 total doors in our indirect channel with a diversified mix that is working quite well.  Before leaving the wireless review, let me wrap up by saying it is obvious that we have built significant momentum and continue to generate strong growth and profitability. We have the most loyal customer base in the industry, the lowest churn in the industry, and a very high percentage of our customers on one- or two-year contracts, an indicator of the quality of our customer base. We continue to introduce innovative products and services for our customers.  In closing, I would say the three headlines for the quarter are: On the cost side, we continue to see significant opportunities to drive margin expansion. Our Verizon services organization, which we mentioned to you last quarter, has identified a number of cost-saving initiatives that span the entire business. Examples include call-center consolidation, strategic sourcing, fleet operations, transportation, real estate and IT systems work.  The information services divestiture is still on track to happen this calendar year. No further information as far structure goes, but this will be forthcoming soon. Details of our Latin America assets are proceeding, and we remain committed to our previously announced 1 billion share repurchase program for 2006. We are well on our way toward that goal, having repurchased 400 million to date.  Thanks for your attention. Ron, I\u2019ll turn it back to you. \nRonald Lataille: Thank you. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead, sir. \n John Hodulik - UBS : Thank you. Two things. First, on the wireless front, the margin\u2019s at 44.5%. I think in the past you talked to \u201906 numbers in the low to mid 40\u2019s, coming off of almost 47% in the fourth quarter. Does it make sense now to talk about maybe mid to upper 40\u2019s going forward in the wireless business? Switching over to the consumer side, you made a couple of moves to improve the stickiness of the products there. First with the reduction in price in the freedom plans, how far through the base are we there in terms of getting those prices down to what would be considered something on par with what you\u2019re seeing from the cable industry.  Second of all, the increase in speeds on the FiOS data service yesterday, just a little bit about the thought process behind that move. \nDoreen Toben: Okay, let me see if I can take them in order. If I start with the wireless margins, I think if you go back, we\u2019ll sort of five consecutive quarters over the 40% level. I\u2019m certainly comfortable that we\u2019ll continue there. I think what I said last time, and I\u2019m going to stay with it, is that in a high growth, which we continue to be a high growth environment, you\u2019ll still going to see sort of low 40\u2019s, what number that is exactly, but low 40\u2019s. If you went to a slower growth, I think you could see that margin kick up over 45 or so, but we will be in the high growth area for a while.  If I move to the freedom question, I think we\u2019re probably where we need to be with freedom pricing right now. We\u2019re pretty comfortable. We did see the effect of the stickiness. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us do much more with pricing on the freedom side of the equation.  I think on the move that you saw yesterday primarily I guess in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut on speed, I think we\u2019re responding. You\u2019ve probably seen that we\u2019ve reorganized a little bit, much more regional, and have laid out the organization that way. I think you\u2019ll see more regional pricing from us, or speeds, and I think it\u2019s really just competing with our competitors in a certain area that we change the speeds. \n John Hodulik - UBS : Okay, thanks. \nRonald Lataille: Next question, operator. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jeffery Halpern of Stanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir. \n Jeffery Halpern - Stanford Bernstein : Thank you. First I just want to say thank you to Dominic for all the work he\u2019s done over the last seven years with our team, at least, and wish him a lot of luck in his new role internally.  As for my questions on wireless, I was hoping you could discuss -- I know you can\u2019t discuss the status of your discussions with Vodafone and VenFin, but I was hoping maybe you could articulate the areas you see as holding the greatest potentials, of course, of synergy if you owned Verizon Wireless outright. Secondly, on FiOS, you obviously gave a lot more incremental detail on your deployment and penetration levels you\u2019re seeing. I was hoping maybe you could discuss some of the areas of operational efficiency that you are also seeing. For example, on slide 11, you mentioned incremental savings from automation and self-service. Does that yet include the benefit of customer self-provisioning on FiOS? Thank you. \n Ivan Seidenberg : Jeff, it\u2019s Ivan here. On the wireless question, you asked two questions about wireless on the Vodafone side. I think the first issue is that you can see that we had extraordinarily strong performance in wireless. We still remain interested in purchasing the 45% of Vodafone\u2019s Verizon Wireless. Vodafone is fully aware of our views of this, and fully aware of how we think about this particular issue.  There\u2019s no new news to report. The decision is really more in their court at this point.  You asked about potential synergies of owning the whole thing. Remember, in this case, in the short-term, what we would say is it\u2019s a trade-off of the extraordinary earnings and capacity of the company. Basically swapping, since we would do this mostly on a cash basis, is swapping that for earnings. We think that\u2019s financially attractive.  In the longer term, we think that wireless markets will regionalize a lot more than they are now. Even Vodafone signaled that with its recent reorganization, so when you think out over two, three, four, five years, what you have is the issue of convergence, which is products and services between wireless and Verizon business. You see consumer plays between wireless and FiOS. You see opportunities for all sorts of bundling.  I think in the longer term, the synergies will come with more product and being a lot more responsive to the convergence of software, consumer electronics, and carrier services that will give us a chance to develop a much stronger presence in the marketplace.  On the cost side, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more we can do. I think that Vodafone and we have done just about everything that we should be doing in the business, so really in the longer term, owning 100% of the assets will make us a lot more competitively regionally, the same way that global wireless markets are beginning to evolve across the globe. \nDoreen Toben: Jeff, by the way, thanks for the kind words on Dominic. We certainly agree, and I know that we\u2019ve gotten that comment from lots of the folks out there. \n Ivan Seidenberg : We gave him a much harder job. \nDoreen Toben: I think on the cost side of the FiOS equation, the savings, most of what we\u2019re seeing is still anecdotal. We are certainly very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. We are not yet into self-provisioning. However, you\u2019ve probably seen the customer satisfaction levels are incredible, and both whether it\u2019s data or video in the product, the churn is extremely low.  As far as the cost at this point, it\u2019s still anecdotal, and we\u2019ll get more to you in the future. \n Jeffery Halpern - Stanford Bernstein : Great, thank you. \nRonald Lataille: Thanks, Jeff. Next question, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Mike McCormack of Bear Stearns. Please go ahead with your question. \n Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns : Maybe just a quick update on what\u2019s happening at MCI. The SME growth looked maybe a little bit weaker than the peers, but maybe you can break it down for us between the legacy Telco versus MCI.  Then, within MCI, can you give us a sense for how quickly you think mass market revenues are going to decline? Secondly, the competition with respect to the Bell South/AT&T transaction, doesn\u2019t that change your competitive positioning out of region? Thanks. \nDoreen Toben: On the legacy Telco versus MCI, I\u2019m not going to go into performance on each of those. It\u2019s extremely difficult. If you think about it, what we\u2019ve done on our ledgers is literally taken people and products and moved them both, so we really don\u2019t have anymore clean here\u2019s what MCI was, here\u2019s what Telco was, from that perspective.  I think if you competitively benchmarked the Enterprise business, I think we\u2019ve done better than maybe some of the others and certainly better than we\u2019ve seen in the past, but that is a combination of both the old Verizon Enterprise as well as the MCI.  Mass market decline, I don\u2019t know that we have a great view of where it\u2019s going. On the out-of-region piece, as I mentioned in our script, we\u2019re not really spending a lot of time with the out-of-region piece, so we expect that will continue to decline. On the in-region piece, where it makes sense, we will move those customers and go after them to move them to retail customers, but you won\u2019t see much focus on the out-of-region customers, and you will continue to see certainly a decline.  Ivan, do you want to do the competition one?\n Ivan Seidenberg : Mike, on the issue of the Bell South/AT&T, the way we would look at it is they\u2019re certainly an important and formidable and obviously the number one player in the market. The way we look at this is that so much of the data market is east of Denver, and we also look at a couple of things. We have a superior wireless proposition, so you balance that with Verizon business, we\u2019re in very good position. We have superior position in a lot of the Enterprise accounts with respect to federal government, state government and the big accounts. MCI had previously a superior position in the international, so we will capitalize on all of that as we go forward.  Where AT&T and Bell South, when you put them together, they probably have some opportunity on the access side to reduce costs, so I think the competition we see there is more on the cost side than it would be on the growth side, so I think we have significant opportunity on the growth side. On the cost side, we\u2019ll just have to work through how we make the critical mass we have, which is pretty significant, work better.  In the first quarter, you saw, as Doreen reported, we had a significant reduction in controllable expense on the part of Verizon business, and we think we have a lot of headroom to continue to drive that down as we go forward. So you should look for us to think of ourselves as the higher growth, and we\u2019ll maintain our presence on the cost side by continuing to improve from where we are. \n Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns : Great, thanks, Ivan. \nRonald Lataille: Thanks, Mike. Next question, operator. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from David Barden of Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\n David Barden - Banc of America Securities : A couple of questions. First, I just want to be clear, if I can, on this issue Ron, you mentioned earlier. You\u2019re not stripping out the amortization of customer lists from your earnings reporting, so if we wanted to do apples and apples comparisons, we\u2019d have to add that roughly $0.05 of earnings back into the numbers to make it comparable with some of the other reporting going on? I just wanted to clarify that.\nDoreen Toben:\n David Barden - Banc of America Securities : Okay, thanks. The transitive property. The second question was obviously great success in the post-pay market to this point in time. Are you at all concerned, or what\u2019s your appetite for a strategy for the pre-paid market? It sounds like a lot of people are really trying to mine that opportunity. Do you feel like you\u2019re letting an opportunity slip by by not being more aggressive on that front? What\u2019s your picture strategically for that market over the rest of the year? Last, just on the FiOS business, could you speak to the conversion rate from old DSL customers to new FiOS customers? Thanks a lot. \n Ivan Seidenberg : When you say what\u2019s the appetite, first of all, we do have some fairly aggressive projects going on in the reseller market with ramp, right? So I think we\u2019re looking at that, but I just think we have to be careful what Kool-Aid we\u2019re drinking here. I think in our view, we have an extraordinarily powerful engine to attract high quality customers on the retail post-pay. We see no reason why we shouldn\u2019t continue to do that, and we don\u2019t want to lose our focus on that.  The reseller and the pre-pay markets, I\u2019m not suggesting they aren\u2019t good customers, but they are higher churn and lower, in the long term, margin customers. So the issue is we want to work our way through that. I think we feel good about where we are with our two trials, and then of course, we have significant, as Doreen pointed out in her remarks, significant activity going on in the distribution channel. So in the longer term, we want to make sure we\u2019re in the right position to vertically grow our business, so the big change that we would like people to look at this quarter is to see what share we took of revenues. And then what you can see is instead of focusing on customer acquisitions, which we have done well on and will continue to do well on, we see now all of the intellectual property that\u2019s been built into our business is now starting to produce a little bit of a breakaway on taking revenue share. \nDoreen Toben: On the DSL question, it\u2019s just under a third conversion to DSL to FiOS.\n David Barden - Banc of America Securities : Very good. Thanks a lot. \nRonald Lataille: Thanks, Dave. Next question, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. \n Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Thanks very much. Doreen, could you give us an update on the expectations or FiOS dilution for the rest of the year, and are we still looking at a 6 million homes past at the end of the year? Also, any comments on the upcoming Spectrum auctions? Thanks. \n Ivan Seidenberg : I could do that. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change, Simon, on either the first two numbers. There\u2019s no change, right? \nDoreen Toben: No, we had said last time, it\u2019s about $0.25 to $0.30, so it\u2019s around $0.06. It might ramp up a tad in the second half of the year. \n Ivan Seidenberg : Great. Simon, on the issue of the SEC\u2019s auction, we are evaluating our options and what I\u2019m told is you have to file an application in a few weeks, and then the bidding doesn\u2019t start until June, so we have a whole month here to sort of organize our thinking of it. As soon as we figure it out and decide, we\u2019ll let you know. \nDoreen Toben: Also, the 6 million hasn\u2019t changed, and I think I used the number in the text where we are, so we\u2019re in good shape for the 6 million. \n Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. \nRonald Lataille: Thanks, Simon. Next question, operator. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Timothy Horan of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead with your question. \n Timothy Horan - CIBC World Markets : Thank you. Good quarter. Two questions, a lot of emerging carriers are seeing the same kind of seachange in the wholesale IP marketable enterprise, I guess, and wholesale. Are you guys seeing the same thing out there in terms of pricing, maybe volumes? Any change there?  On the Vodafone issue, I think one of the concerns had been paying taxes on any sale historically. Is that still a concern, and are there any other steps you could take, maybe having a publicly traded wireless stock to spin out the shareholders, or anything else to get around that? Thanks. \n Ivan Seidenberg : I don\u2019t want to get in over my head here, but on the first question about the wholesale IP and the seachange, here\u2019s the way I think we would look at that. The way we look at the market and what our people are telling us is that there\u2019s tremendous activity out there right now for next-generation products, new products and services, and all these managed network services -- in that area, we feel that there\u2019s some stability and rationality to how we\u2019re bidding and how we see the market accepting these bids.  With respect to conversions and all these other renewals and everything else, we\u2019re not sure that we\u2019re seeing the same seachange. Maybe others have, but we talk to the same customers they do. We\u2019re not sure of that.  So I think the quicker we get to the next generation products, that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the stability come in, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on the growth areas in this market.  Overall, I think that we\u2019re better off today after the consolidation with the new AT&T and the consolidation for Verizon. I think we\u2019re heading in the right direction, but seachange is a strong term. So I think we\u2019re incrementally moving in the right direction.  With Vodafone, the issue is that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been any change in assumption that whenever a transaction would be consummated, whether it\u2019s now or two years or 20 years, there\u2019s going to be a tax bill. I don\u2019t think anybody should think that there\u2019s any way around that. I think that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s the reason why if you look at a transaction, you pay a premium on an EBITDA multiple-basis, a cash flow basis that would cover some of that. I think it\u2019s part of the drill.  By the way, I think the same -- you do get some efficiency by coupling Omnitel with the transaction, which I didn\u2019t mention before, but we\u2019re certainly going to do that.  So I think, Tim, we are very comfortable with trying to be as efficient as we can, but I don\u2019t think that we understand a structure right now that would eliminate the gains on a business that we had built in the past ten years, and the gains are extraordinary. I think it\u2019s just part of the deal unless, Doreen, you have a\u2026\nDoreen Toben: No, I don\u2019t have any. I don\u2019t think we would look to IPO it. \n Ivan Seidenberg : No. \n Timothy Horan - CIBC World Markets : Okay, thank you. \nRonald Lataille: Okay, Tim, thanks. Next question, operator. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. \n Michael Rollins - Citigroup : Good morning. A couple of questions. First, back on the wireless side, as you\u2019re looking to manage revenue share in wireless, can you talk about the prospects of possibly returning to growth in ARPU and how you look at those opportunities and whether you think that\u2019s feasible over the next 12 to 24 months.  The second question is just back on the MCI side. When you talked about the integration process and laid it out, you talked about a lot of work that had to be done to the network, a lot of investment that you wanted to put into the network to further integrate it. Can you talk about where we are in that process and how we should expect those integration expenses to be invested through the year? Thanks. \nDoreen Toben: On the revenue, first of all, I think over the longer term, data growth, we\u2019re over 11% now. We have 3G coming. V CAST is really starting to really go. You\u2019ve got music really starting to kick in, so I would say over the longer term, you\u2019ll see a difference, but I do want to say that we -- the most important thing that I measure is really revenue growth and margins. To the extent that the ARPU is flat or a little bit down or a little bit up, the two key metrics really is what\u2019s your revenue growth and how high is my margin.  Having said that, data will continue to be a much bigger piece going forward. \n Ivan Seidenberg : Absolutely. I think that when you think of all of the upside opportunity, when you lay your broadband network on top of wireless, I think you\u2019re going to see tremendous vertical opportunity going forward. Frankly, I think as all the carriers start investing in these things, and some of them have a little bit of a catch-up here, but as we all start doing that, I think the whole industry will start moving in the direction of more vertical growth. To me, that\u2019s a good sign.  On the MCI thing, I guess the one point I would make is that I think Doreen laid out the synergy plan here. I think we have a very fast operational start. We also talked about, we had some significant force reductions in March that will start to show up in April, May and June and the rest of the year. We have a capital program in MCI of about a little over $1.6 billion I guess it is that we said. That\u2019s about the right number. It could deviate by $100 million here or there, but we\u2019re in the right ballpark on that.  If I may make one point, the one thing we\u2019ve never said is prior to the transaction, a lot of us here had some question about what we would find once we closed the transaction. The good news is that once we closed the transaction, there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve seen on the network side or the IT side that was different than what MCI told us, so we feel very comfortable that we have a good path on the $550 million in synergies this year, and all of the other grooming and all of the other restrictive minutes that we\u2019ve been able to do with Verizon Wireless and Verizon Telecom.  So I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s anything else that we could suggest, other than we feel very comfortable in where we are in the process for our 2006 plan. And as we move into \u201907, we\u2019ll talk about that more later in the year. \n Michael Rollins - Citigroup : Thank you. \nRonald Lataille: Thanks, Mike. Next question, operator. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\n Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. A couple of questions. First on video, you obviously had some good traction with video penetration in some of the initial markets. I\u2019m wondering if you could update us on the success-based costs in the video installs, sort of how that\u2019s trending.  Second question, just to hit Vodafone one more time, maybe from a different angle, I\u2019m wondering specifically if you could talk about any sort of tax or balance sheet advantages to buying the entire stake versus doing a transaction in pieces. Finally, just a housekeeping question on international. You mentioned the sale of directory publication rights in Puerto Rico, and I think associated with this was some sort of a one-time royalty step-up which impacted revenues and EBITDA. I\u2019m just wondering if you could quantify that amount. Thanks. \nDoreen Toben: On the international, it was in my script. It was $160 million, maybe $165 million revenue. So that was that piece of it.  On the video penetration, we are on the home path number probably where we said we needed to be, so we are doing extremely well there. My sense is we will probably beat the number that we had out to the streets there, so real good progress.  On the connected, we are not where we need to be at, so we\u2019re making progress, but certainly not there yet. However, I will make a comment for \u201906. The past capital number is a much bigger number than the connected number, as you would imagine, because we\u2019re capping 6 million homes, but there\u2019s no capital push on the budget for \u201906 or on what we\u2019ll spend, but we need some more work to do on connected, and cash is in really good shape. \n Ivan Seidenberg : In all fairness to Vodafone, there really isn\u2019t much else to say on this one. As I said earlier, we\u2019re interested in acquiring the share, and that\u2019s a good asset, but the next step is really up to our partners in Verizon Wireless, Vodafone. And they fully understand our views on this.  You\u2019re right, there are probably a gazillion ways of looking at this, and I can assure you we\u2019ve looked at all gazillion ways, so let\u2019s just leave that sit now and we\u2019ll get back to it when it\u2019s appropriate. \n Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs : Okay, thanks. \nRonald Lataille: Thanks, Jason. Operator, I would like to turn the call over to Ivan Seidenberg right now for some concluding remarks. \n Ivan Seidenberg : Thank you always for your interest in the company. I only have a couple of comments. I think most of your questions cover the highlights. As Doreen indicated, we feel we\u2019re off to a solid start in \u201906. We\u2019ve got superior momentum in wireless. There\u2019s always the question that we get about the sustainability in the quarter-over-quarter build. Hopefully you see in this quarter, we\u2019ve added some new dimensions, a significant pick-up in data revenues, terrific churn performance, which really shows the depth of our network reliability and best network concept. We\u2019re really focused on lots of new products into the marketplace, and taking revenue share.  MCI off to a fast operational start, and I know everybody always looks for inflexion points, whatever that means, but I think we\u2019re at a point here where for the rest of the year, you\u2019ll see us building momentum here on both the revenue and the margin side, and the MCI transaction. We\u2019re very excited about the customer activity out there that would suggest that the market may be ready for a lot of new products and services in this space, which should bode well for the entire sector, frankly.  On the Telco side, the questions that you asked are all good ones. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have more. The exciting thing for us is that the theory of the case is starting to be demonstrated in results that we\u2019ve seen, this terrific focus on speed of internet access and speed of delivery of services. We\u2019ve seen what the video bundle does. We see what the 15 to 30 megabytes data speeds do. We feel that\u2019s a terrific proposition. Our goal is to scale it as fast as we can and move through the process. But bundles are great and we think that will do very well.  Hopefully you notice that while we\u2019re doing all that and we still have competitive activity. We\u2019ve taken some steps with regional and local pricing, as well as a very strong focus on controllable expenses in the quarter, so we\u2019re able to hold margins in the legacy Verizon Telco and overall, and move our business forward.  The overall business model for us is really a focus on improving revenues throughout the year, improving margins throughout the year, and improving cash flow throughout the year.  We didn\u2019t talk in the call about other activities that we have in place, the return guide to shareholders, but we\u2019re moving along in the disposition of our three international properties. They\u2019re moving along quite well and we should start to see the fruits of that in the second quarter with perhaps one or even two of the transactions moving to closure before we announce earnings for the second quarter.  Then we\u2019re moving along in our planning and the disposition of directory, and we\u2019ll have a lot more to say to you about that during the second quarter. So we feel that we\u2019re in a very good position to show incremental improvements throughout the year. With that, Ron, I think that I have no further comments and we all thank you very much for your being with us this morning. \nRonald Lataille: Thanks, Ivan, and thank you everybody for joining us this morning."}], "2008": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2007, "date": "2008-01-28 13:52:32", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Doreen A. Toben - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President Dennis F. Strigl - President, Chief Operating Officer Ivan G. Seidenberg - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nAnalysts: John Hodulik - UBS David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch David Barden - Banc of America  Michael Rollins - Citigroup Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns Tom Sykes - Lehman Brothers Daniel Gabedi - Morgan Stanley Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse  \nRon Lataille: Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny  Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication, and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.  This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.  Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I\u2019d like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter.  Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.37. Adjusted earnings, or EPS before the effects of special items, were $0.62. We are excluding the following special items from adjusted results.  The first is a $477 million after-tax charge, or $0.16 per share for severance and other related expenses. These costs are being recognized as a result of work force reductions which began in the fourth quarter and will continue throughout 2008. The charge is associated with the reduction of approximately 9,000 employees. Nearly 4,000 were in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the remainder will be during 2008.  Next is a $139 million, or $0.05 per share charge for additional taxes and related expenses associated with an increase in the distributable earnings from Vodafone Omnitel.  We are also excluding a $36 million after-tax charge, or $0.01 per share, for non-operational costs incurred in connection with the spin-off of access lines in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. These costs are mostly related to network, software, and other activities which will enable the impacted facilities and systems to function on a standalone basis.  The last item is a $58 million after-tax charge, or $0.02 per share, for merger integration costs.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. \nDoreen A. Toben: Thanks, Ron and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter capped a year of very strong performance and momentum as all key strategic areas of growth did well. One of our objectives in 2007 was to noticeably increase shareowner value by accelerating growth. Top line growth improved to 5.8% compared with 3.3% pro forma growth in 2006. We also focused on productivity and margin improvements.  Both operating income and EBITDA margins expanded over last year. Operating income increased $2.5 billion, or 17.9%. As for earnings, we posted double-digit growth in adjusted EPS from continuing operations.  Our $0.62 compares with $0.52 a year ago, up 19.2%. We finished the year at $2.36 per share, up 15.1% from 2006. In September, we announced a dividend increase of 6.2%, or $0.10 per share per year, a clear indication of the confidence we have in our cash outlook, and we\u2019ve continued to repurchase shares.  In the fourth quarter, we repurchased more than $1.1 billion of our common stock, bringing our 2007 total to more than $2.8 billion. Over the last two years, our stock buy-back program has totaled $4.5 billion and at current prices, we will continue to be buyers of our stock.  Our strong performance in 2007 reflects our commitment to investors to accelerate growth, expand margins, and create shareowner value.  On slide four, you can see that fourth quarter revenues increased to $23.8 billion, up 5.6% year over year. For the full year 2007, consolidated revenues totaled $93.5 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion, or 250 basis points of incremental growth.  In addition to these revenue gains, our focus on cost reductions and several ongoing productivity initiatives helped improve margins. Our fourth quarter operating margin of 18.2% represents a 200 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year. EBITDA margin of 33.5% was also up 110 basis points compared with fourth quarter last year. For the full year, operating income margin expanded 180 basis points. So good progress at the margin, with profitable revenue growth in both wireline and wireless segments.  Turning to cash flows, we received a net $2.1 billion in dividends from Vodafone Omnitel in December. This helped cash flows from continuing operations to reach $26.3 billion for 2007, an increase of 14.2%. We finished the year with just over $31 billion in debt, paying down more than $5 billion during 2007.  Capital expenditures for 2007 came in at $17.5 billion. Wireline spending was just under $11 billion and wireless was $6.5 billion, and our ratio of CapEx to revenue improved to 18.8%.  Our balance sheet is as strong as it\u2019s ever been, so let\u2019s look now at our segment results, beginning with Verizon Wireless on slide six.  In wireless, we had another strong quarter of customer growth with 2 million total net adds, 1.9 million of which were retail. We ended the year with a customer base that is 97% retail, reflecting our continued focus on this market. Eighty-seven percent, or 1.65 million of the retail net adds in the quarter, were postpaid. We now have 61 million retail postpaid customers.  Our industry leading churn rates continue to be excellent. Total churn was 1.2% and retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, so a very strong year of customer growth with 6.9 million retail net adds, and 6.3 million retail postpaid.  Turning to slide seven, total service revenues were up 13.7% in the fourth quarter and nearly 16% for the full year. Retail service revenues grew 14.4% this quarter as retail service ARPU increased 1.4% to $51.49.  For the full year, retail service ARPU grew 2.2%. Data revenues represented 21.3% of total service revenue in the quarter, as compared to 15.8% a year ago. We saw wireless data revenues grow $2.9 billion, or 65% in 2007. In 2007, retail data ARPU increased 44% or $3.09 per user. Retail data ARPU in the fourth quarter was $11.06. We see enormous potential for growth in wireless data for years to come.  With our national 3G network and track record of innovation and industry first, we are well-positioned to take advantage of this huge growth opportunity.  In summary, Verizon Wireless continues to lead the industry in retail customers, total revenue, customer loyalty, and profitability.  Wireless revenues of just under $44 billion, which represents 47% of total Verizon revenues, grew 15.3% in 2007. Half of this annual growth was from data. In fact, about 74% of our retail customers are data users.  Most important, we\u2019ve sustained our track record of profitable growth. 2007 EBITDA grew $2.4 billion, or 16.8%, and EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 44.6%. We have a proven business model. These results are further evidence of great execution, sustainable growth, and strong cash generation.  Within wireline, our strategic products also showed impressive growth in 2007. On the consumer side, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we now have more than 1 million FiOS TV customers.  As you can see on slide nine, we added 226,000 net new FiOS TV customers in the fourth quarter, ending 2007 with 943,000 subscribers and a penetration rate of 16%. At the end of the year, we were marketing FiOS TV service to about 5.9 million homes, up 1.2 million from the end of third quarter. Almost half of the increase at homes open for sale came in December.  Total broadband subscribers, DSL plus FiOS Internet, increased to 8.2 million, up 1.2 million or 18% from a year ago. During the quarter, we added 245,000 net new FiOS Internet customers and 19,000 net DSL subscribers for a total of 264,000 net broadband adds. We now have more than 1.5 million FiOS Internet subscribers representing 21% penetration of the 7.5 million homes open for sale.  Retail residential line loss of 616,000 in the quarter showed some improvement from last quarter and was about the same as the fourth quarter a year ago. We continue to see an increasing correlation between the availability of FiOS TV and improved line retention. At the end of the year, almost 80% of the 7.5 million FiOS homes open for sale could also subscribe to our video service.  Clearly our consumer retail business is increasingly centered on broadband, video, and bundles. As shown on slide 10, our legacy consumer revenue growth was 2.7% for the fourth quarter and the full year, a significant improvement from negative growth this time a year ago.  Increases in broadband and video revenue have driven consumer retail ARPU to $59.48, an increase of 11% year over year. All of our regional markets had ARPU accretion in 2007. Our strategy of investment and innovation is clearly driving consumer revenue growth.  Now let\u2019s take a look at Verizon business. In this market, we continue to see strong demand for data services. Total Verizon business revenues grew 0.5% for the fourth quarter, and 1.8% for the full year. The fourth quarter was disproportionately impacted by some customers moving traffic off of our network and some contract timing issues. However, we are confident in our ability to overcome these effects and expect revenue growth to be back on trend within the first half of 2008.  Our strategic services, which represent about 27% of total Verizon business, sustained strong revenue growth trends, increasing both sequentially and year over year. Here, our fourth quarter and full year revenue growth exceeds 25%. Growth was once again driven by Private IP, managed services, and security.  Looking at total wireline on slide 12, we continue to see revenue and margin improvement. In 2006, revenues declined nearly $2.9 billion, or 5.3%. In 2007, revenues declined $639 million, or 1.3%. This improvement was driven by growth in Verizon business as we continue to win new business and compete successfully as the transition to IP continues for large enterprise customers.  We also saw growth in small and medium business as legacy revenues topped $5 billion for the year and grew 3.6%. Within wholesale, special access revenues of $4 billion grew 4.1%, and on the residential side, even though line losses continue, we successfully increased revenue per customer, which resulted in improved legacy consumer revenue growth.  As in wireless, data services are a big driver of wireline revenue growth. Data in the fourth quarter represented 38% of total wireline revenue and grew nearly 12% for the year.  In terms of improving profitability, we are making good progress. Fourth quarter wireline operating income margins expanded 80 basis points year over year and 30 basis points sequentially to 9.7%. Estimated earnings dilution from FiOS was $0.09 in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $0.39. We\u2019ve seen improvements in customer acceptance rates, capital unit cost trends, and installation productivity.  While we continue to focus on driving top line and ARPU growth, we are equally focused on reducing costs across the entire business. We want to make sure that revenue growth and increased efficiencies continue to result in improved profitability and margins.  When looking at our cost profile, one of the big categories is obviously the employee workforce. As shown on slide 13, we\u2019ve steadily reduced wireline headcount by about 12,000 over the past two years. Ron mentioned severance associated with forced reductions that started in late 2007 and will continue throughout 2008.  As we look further out in the planning period, we see opportunities for ongoing force reductions. We also continue to see additional cost reduction opportunities through system consolidations by moving to common platforms and by innovations in the area of customer self-service. Both Denny and I remain very bullish about our opportunities to achieve incremental cost savings throughout the business.  So as we close the book on 2007, I\u2019d say we made great progress and delivered very strong financial and operating performance. But as a management team, we recognize there is much more to do. We are in aggressive pursuit of a number of revenue growth opportunities. Our network capabilities and the strength of our products and services position us well to sustain our growth momentum.  In wireless, our business plan targets continued double-digit revenue growth and in wireline, revenue growth will continue to improve.  As I said, we are equally focused on productivity and operating efficiency, which provide opportunities for margin expansion. In wireless, we continue to see service EBITDA margins in the range of 43% to 45%. In wireline, we are striving for continued margin improvement. Our goal is to expand wireline EBITDA margins targeting a range of 30% to 33%.  We will continue investing in the networks and new technologies to provide the platform for growth, innovation, and productivity. For 2008, we are targeting capital spending to be below this year\u2019s number of $17.5 billion, and we\u2019ve set targets for wireline and wireless that are slightly lower than 2007.  Before we get to your questions, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation about the potential impact of an economic slowdown. I would say that we have not seen a change in sales expectations through January. Obviously we are monitoring numerous metrics very closely and at this point, we don\u2019t see any material changes.  We expect 2008 to be a solid year. We are targeting another year of meaningful earnings growth and growth in operating income margins. Our cash flow projections provide for continued network investment and the ability to pay a competitive dividend. And we will also continue to regard share repurchases as a prudent use of cash.  In summary, we are very confident in our outlook for 2008 and the ability to deliver strong results and create shareowner value.  With that, I will turn it back to Ron. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Denny and Doreen are now available to take questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from John Hodulik with UBS. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS:  Two quick ones; first, on the FiOS homes passed, the 9.3 million is a little bit more than I think you guys had targeted. Could you talk a little bit about \u201908 and what the plans are there? And second of all, the wireline margins were also a little bit better than we thought and then, I think the guidance you guys just talked about, 30% to 33% -- first of all, could you talk about over what timeframe you expect to get to those levels and what the cause of the strength was in the fourth quarter here?\nDoreen A. Toben: I think if I take them in reverse order, the wireline 30% to 33%, I would say that\u2019s over the planning period, which I would say is three to five years from that perspective.  As far as why the margins kicked up, I think clearly a lot of the people went off in the fourth quarter. They went off late third quarter, into the fourth quarter so the biggest bump of headcount really came in the fourth quarter. We were also able to do some things. We had outsourced EDS last year and we really started to get the bulk of those benefits in the fourth quarter because it was much higher last year, so those really have come down.  And just continued emphasis on cost reductions, and I think Denny\u2019s talked about before, in some of our centralized organizations has really started to kick in. We\u2019ve seen some of the synergies in Verizon business really start to help us, so they have been on the right trajectory for continued margin improvement as we go into \u201908.  And on the FiOS homes passed, I think -- \nDennis F. Strigl: Three million more this year. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS:  Okay, great. Off of the 9.3, I take it? Sounds great. Thanks. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from David Janazzo with Merrill Lynch.\nDavid Janazzo - Merrill Lynch: Doreen, you mentioned the economy and looking at numerous metrics. Can you review with us what those metrics are? And versus history, I mean, the business mix is a little bit different now -- no more directories, obviously more wireless and wireless substitution. How do you think about the response of the business in the future versus some of the historical measures?\nDoreen A. Toben: Okay, David. As you would imagine, I have been all over this for months, so on a daily basis I look at wireless sales, wireless disconnects, net adds, and churn, all by region, so very localized. For wireline, I look at access lines, I look at broadband, FiOS DSL, FiOS TV, all also by region and enterprise, I look at sales.  On more of a weekly/monthly basis, where I\u2019ve been really looking hard is what you expect the discretionary services, so if I look at wireless, what are the ringtones doing, what is music doing, what is games doing? If I look at FiOS, I\u2019m looking at the premium channels, the VODs, the DVRs. Broadband, I\u2019m looking at speed.  By the way, I\u2019ll get to the trends in a second but just to mention, we went live with some self-provisioning on our remote shortly and the premium channel take-up has really increased, so really good trends.  And then, both wireline and wireless, of course I\u2019m looking at the write-offs, I\u2019m looking at bad debt, disconnects, non-pay, the percent that the collection agencies are actually collecting, CPE sales, and of course volumes of DS1s and DS3s.  And then externally what I try to do is I look at housing starts, mortgage delinquencies, unemployment, and then I actually do sort of a running regression to see which are the most impactful, and then competitive activity. So if I put all that together and say what do I see, I really don\u2019t see much trend change at all for us, including through January. A real small pocket of one or two states in the Midwest where I see some impact having to do with the economy. Very small numbers of lines for us in those states, so not impactful at all. Not really seeing anything in any of the urban areas. I have seen a small impact on, and Denny mentioned this previously, on Verizon Wireless and the over 90-day on collectibles. Still very low, below 2% but some impact.  But I think the point of your question was right -- our base has really changed. So we have a lot more customers now under contract than we ever had. From the enterprise side, we have much more international exposure. Typically we would have seen the first impact years gone past in directory on non-pay but we don\u2019t really have directory anymore. Our wireless customers are always the highest credit standards, the need for broadband continues, so to say I\u2019m looking at this on a daily basis is absolutely accurate and not seeing trend changes, so I\u2019m encouraged by that. \nDavid Janazzo - Merrill Lynch: And just to comment maybe on some of the FiOS markets, particularly the FiOS video market versus a non-FiOS market?\nDoreen A. Toben: The FiOS markets are clearly stronger from that perspective. As far as when I look at access lines and the trends at access lines, it is absolutely clear that FiOS is impactful. However, even looking at areas of non-FiOS, we\u2019re still not seeing a change in trend but FiOS is clearly helpful. \nDennis F. Strigl: I would add to what Doreen has said here that if we did see an impact developing on the business, I believe that we can take steps to avoid any material disruptions. For example, we can make adjustments to the force, overtime levels, consulting and contractor expenses, travel and so on.  The point is that I think Doreen and I remain very confident about 2008 despite all of the noise we are hearing about the economy. \nDavid Janazzo - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from David Barden with Banc of America. \nDavid Barden - Banc of America : Just maybe two, first on wireless; obviously there\u2019s a growing sense that as we get north of the 80% penetration rate in wireless that the quality of the incremental subscribers is going to decline and to the extent that the industry\u2019s been feasting on Sprint a little bit, that that might moderate or diminish this year.  I noticed 16% of the net adds were, retail net adds were prepay this quarter and I was wondering if you could kind of just speak to the general mix of how you see volume and ARPUs driving revenues in \u201908 versus \u201907.  And then the second on the wireline margin, I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re still targeting EBITDA positive on FiOS this year. If you marry that with the headcount cuts, presupposing that the overall wireline climate doesn\u2019t deteriorate, we should be looking for some reasonable tick-up in wireline margins in \u201908. I was wondering if you could kind of put some parameters around that and maybe talk about how pensions might affect that in \u201908 too, Doreen. Thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: Let me start on the wireless side and then turn it over to Doreen. First of all, yes, 80% penetration levels in wireless. We continue to expect to take a disproportionate share of the industry gross adds over the planning period. Our focus is on revenue growth and maintaining industry-leading margins.  Relative to prepaid, our focus has always been on the retail post-paid market. However, we have seen more adds coming from prepay. We enhanced our own prepaid products late last year and we expect continued strength in retail postpaid and some increase on the prepaid side of the business.  I think looking at ARPU, our ARPU has been driven in large part by growth in data revenues and our retail data ARPU grew 44% in 2007. And our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to see some strong data growth going forward into \u201908, so that\u2019s the data side, the wireless side of the business. \nDoreen A. Toben: On the wireline margin, yes, we are -- I am still confident that we\u2019ll be EBITDA positive in \u201908. In fact, we have at least one or two states that are EBITDA positive now, those that have been around longer, so we feel good about that.  Other than to tell you the target is sort 30% to 33% and I feel confident that we will have improvement next year, I\u2019m not going to give you a pinpoint number.  On the pension and OPEB, expect it to be relatively flat year. There will be some medical costs that will tick up so that -- basically pension and OPEB you should plan to be relatively flat. \nDavid Barden - Banc of America : Okay, guys. Thanks for that. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. \nMichael Rollins - Citigroup: Just a couple of questions; first, I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on what\u2019s happening with DSL, especially outside of the FiOS markets and what we should expect on that front for 2008.  And Denny, just a quick clarification; a few weeks ago you mentioned that the long-term wireline OIBDA margin could approach 33% to 34%, which is the higher end of the range that you guys provided this morning. So is that still the long-term goal for OIBDA margins or do you see a need to take that long-term goal in a little bit? Thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: Michael, we continue to see that as the long-term goal, yes. On the DSL side, if you look at the combined net adds for DSL, FiOS Internet, and FiOS TV, the net add numbers are fairly constant, about 490,000. What\u2019s changed is the mix, which reflects our investment and the marketing focus that we\u2019ve had over the last year. You see some DSL migration to FiOS Internet. You also see DSL migration to wireless broadband and churn incidentally has actually remained fairly constant. DSL subs actually grew 6.5% in \u201907 and revenue grew nearly 14%. So I don\u2019t see these dynamics changing going forward. \nMichael Rollins - Citigroup: Thank you. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Mike McCormack with Bear Stearns. \nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: A couple of things; on the enterprise side, it looked like the year-over-year rate of growth slowed pretty dramatically and I know at least historically, fourth quarter is typically a pretty tough quarter for that. I\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019s typical seasonal patterns or whether you are seeing something else there. And secondly on -- the primary voice lines continue to deteriorate and you had another fairly bad quarter on primary lines. I\u2019m just wondering when we\u2019re going to start to see the impact of FiOS line retention on some of those primary line counts. Thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: First, looking at the enterprise side, our enterprise sales momentum actually is continuing to be very strong and actually what occurred in the fourth quarter was frankly kind of annoying to me. We did not offset the take-back fast enough. This is a timing issue. The lower growth number this quarter really shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as a shift in the structure of the business. All traffic from these few primary, major customers that we lost will be gone within the first half of the year. We expect revenue growth to be back on trend within the first half of the year as we grow through the loss. Incidentally, one of the losses was a large cable company, so no surprise there. \nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: Denny, could you give us a sense -- I think that was on the wholesale side. I was looking more --\nDennis F. Strigl: -- million dollars in the first half of \u201907 and the fourth quarter growth would have been 1.2% excluding that issue. \nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: Hey, Denny -- \nDennis F. Strigl: By the way, if you look at our enterprise customer base, all-in with international revenues, for example, our revenue grew 2.4% in the fourth quarter.  On the line loss, I\u2019d just simply say my goal is to retain as many customers as possible. We\u2019re not seeing any change in the macro drivers, technology substitution, or competition. A very competitive marketplace and as I think you know, as we are more successful, we\u2019re more successful actually in retaining customers where we have FiOS TV, so as we expand the availability of FiOS it should help our retention. \nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: If you could just pull apart the VZ business revenue, I think we understood the wholesale pressures but it looked like the retail enterprise also had a deceleration in growth. Is that just typical seasonal patterns?\nDennis F. Strigl: Yeah, the cable was in enterprise. \nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: Okay. Thanks. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tom Sykes with Lehman Brothers. \nTom Sykes - Lehman Brothers: SME still grew around 3.6% but DSL, I guess particularly out of the FiOS region, continues to be somewhat de-emphasized so I\u2019m wondering, given the economy, what\u2019s driving that growth? Is FiOS having an impact on SME? And given the softening economy generally impacts small business first, can you give us any trends in that area? And then I was wondering if you could update us on any progress you might have made with some of the big metropolitan areas. There were some press reports regarding FiOS in New York City and any update there would be appreciated. Thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: I think both questions are very closely related. FiOS is helping us in the small business market, yes, but not to any great extent at this point. Relative to the MDUs, as we put in place more big city franchises, you will see us passing more multiple dwelling units. That will help on the small business side as well as just the typical apartment housing and so forth.  Where do we stand in that regard? You will see in the course of 2008 that we will have a few major cities where we expect to have franchises granted. This will have an impact toward the end of \u201908 and into the \u201909 year. We think we\u2019ve got some very good opportunity in the MDU market place. This will also help us significantly on the cost side. \nTom Sykes - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you very much. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Tom. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nDaniel Gabedi - Morgan Stanley: This is actually Daniel [Gabedi] on behalf of Simon. My question is on broadband penetration. What\u2019s your estimate of broadband penetration of households in your major markets and how much more room for growth is there? And if you could also talk about any plans to boost speeds of DSL in non-FiOS markets? Thank you. \nDoreen A. Toben: I think if you look at broadband penetration of those homes that have a PC and those that are broadband, using broadband, it\u2019s really close to 75%, so we think that there\u2019s a relatively high penetration already of broadband.  And then as far as doing higher speeds of DSL, yes, we are actually looking at that. We\u2019ve made some announcements of doing 7-meg so we\u2019re rolling that out this year -- well, actually, we rolled out last year. We are rolling out more of it this year because we do think it\u2019s important to kick up the speeds of DSL. \nDaniel Gabedi - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. \nRon Lataille: Thanks, Daniel. Operator, this will be our last question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Your final question is from Chris Larsen with Credit Suisse.\nChris Larsen - Credit Suisse : I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the FiOS, the installation trends, both in costs and lead times, and then maybe the demands for services as it relates to the free TV offer that you had in the fourth quarter and maybe some thoughts going into \u201908 for those install times.  And then secondly on the FairPoint transaction, if you could just give us an update on timing and I know that there\u2019s been some request for less debt -- if you could give us an idea of what the expected impact and your relative ability to delever off that transaction is. Thanks. \nDennis F. Strigl: Chris, let me take the FiOS part of this and we have made some significant progress throughout the course of \u201907. In fact, we eliminated two to three hours off the installed time during the year. I\u2019m still not satisfied with that but I\u2019m confident that we can be more efficient, both from a time-to-install productivity overall on FiOS, so I think we have some good upside in that regard.  I\u2019m at this point happy with the FiOS TV and Internet volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve made some steady progress in reducing our overall costs and again, we expect to be able to continue that into \u201908.  During the fourth quarter, we did allow more overtime to meet the heavy customer demand that we experienced. Of course, that was our choice. The impact of the free TV offer during the quarter was really not material to our overall costs. \nDoreen A. Toben: And then on FairPoint, I think we were expecting it to close first quarter still and the de-levering is about maybe $300 million, so not a huge number for the total transaction. \nChris Larsen - Credit Suisse : Thanks a lot, really appreciate it. \nRon Lataille: Okay, Chris. Thank you, everybody for joining our call today and have a good day."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-10-29 11:51:03", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - IR  Doreen Toben - CFO  Denny Strigl - President, COO \nAnalysts: David Barden - Banc of AmericaSecurities  Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns  John Hodulik - UBS  Michael Rollins - Citigroup  Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley  Tim Horan - CIBC  David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch  Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers \nOperator: Welcome to the Verizon third quarter 2007 earningsconference call. (Operator Instructions). It is now my pleasure to turn thecall over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President of InvestorRelations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille:  Good morning andwelcome to our third quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Thanks for joiningus this morning. I am Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, ourPresident and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Toben, our Chief FinancialOfficer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earningsrelease, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and thepresentation slides are on the Investor Relations website. This call is beingwebcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from ourwebsite. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information inthis presentation contains statements about expected future events andfinancial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained inVerizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financialmeasures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directlycomparable GAAP measures are also on our website. Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of ourresults, I would like to cover the differences between reported and adjustedearnings for the third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.44.Adjusted earnings, or EPS before the effects of special items, were $0.63.  There are three special items which we are excluding fromadjusted results: The first is a $471 million or $0.16 per share charge forinternational taxes and related expenses that would be payable as a result ofpossible distributions from our Vodafone Omnitel investment. We're estimatingthat our portion of their distributable earnings may amount to as much as $2.5billion pre-tax over the next 12 months. The second item is a $44 million after-tax charge, or $0.02per share, for costs incurred in connection with the spin-off of access linesin Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.These costs, which we are excluding as non-operational, are mostly related tonetwork, software and other activities which will enable the impactedfacilities and systems to function on a standalone basis. We will continue toincur these types of costs between now and closing, so you can expect a similarspecial item to be excluded from our results next quarter. The last item is the $28 million, or $0.01 per share, chargefor MCI merger integration costs. With that I will now turn the call over to Doreen.\nDoreen Toben: Thanks, Ron and good morning, everyone. Before we get intothe numbers, I would like to make a few observations. The third quarter wasanother very solid quarter for us. All key growth areas of the businessperformed well. Wireless and FiOS customer growth was particularly strong.Verizon business revenues increased once again, and we continue to makeimprovements in wireline revenues and margins. Our results once againdemonstrate the focus we have on accelerating customer and revenue growth,controlling costs and expanding margins. Consolidated revenues increased to $23.8 billion thisquarter, up 6% year over year and more than 2% sequentially. Our operatingincome margins expanded to 18.1% as operating income increased 18.5% year over yearand more than 3% sequentially.  As for earnings, this is our third consecutive quarter ofdouble-digit growth in adjusted EPS from continuing operations. Our $0.63compared with $0.55 a year ago, up 14.5%. Year-to-date, EPS from continuingoperations have increased 13.6%. Let's take a closer look at consolidated revenues andmargins. Our accelerating revenue growth has resulted in a $500 millionsequential increase and a $1.3 billion year-over-year improvement. During thethird quarter, we saw strong top line performance in our key growth areas.Verizon wireless revenues were up 14.4%, legacy consumer revenues grew 3.1% andVerizon business revenues increased 2.2% compared to a year ago. This revenuegrowth has resulted in higher ARPU and margin expansion. In addition, productivity initiatives are helping to reshapeour cost structure. On slide 4 you can see the operating income marginimprovement. Of note, both wireless and wireline are contributing to positiveoperating income growth. Our third quarter operating margin of 18.1% represents190 basis point improvement over the same quarter a year ago. ConsolidatedEBITDA was 33.3% or 100 basis points better than a year ago; so very profitablegrowth as we drive the business to accelerate revenues, increase ARPU andexpand margins. Our cash flows from continuing operations remain strong. Ouryear-to-date totaled $18 billion, representing 5% growth over last year. Wehave continued to repurchase shares. During the quarter we repurchased nearly $800million of our common stock. Through nine months, we have bought back more than$1.7 billion. Our capital spending remains on target at $12.8 billion for thefirst nine months with both wireline and wireless right where we expected themto be. Now let's look at our segment results beginning with Verizonwireless on slide 6. Inwireless, our key focus is on the retail market, and we have sustained ourindustry leadership. As we have said before, more customers use Verizon wirelessthan any other wireless brand. We had another strong quarter of customer growthwith 1.8 million retail net adds. We are up to 61.8 million retail customers,which is more than 97% of our total customer base. Almost all the retail netadds were postpaid. Retail postpaid customers grew 1.7 million to 59.4 millionthis quarter. I would also highlight our continued leadership in customerloyalty. Retail churn was 1.21%, and retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, bothseasonally higher on a sequential basis. Postpaid churn was essentially flatyear over year. Retail gross add performance was very strong, up 12.3% sequentiallyand 3.8% year over year with more than two-thirds of these retail sales comingfrom direct channels. Total net adds for the quarter, including wholesale, were1.6 million. Turning to slide 7, total service revenues were up 15.1% inthe third quarter, sustaining our strong growth trend. Retail service revenues,which comprised nearly 98% of total service, grew 15.9%. Retail service ARPU of$52.17 was up nearly $1 year over year and $0.33 sequentially. Data revenuesgrew 63% year over year and now represent more than 20% of total servicerevenue, up from 14.1% one year ago. Retail data ARPU grew to $10.59, up 43% from a year ago.About 68% of our retail customers are data users. More than 35% of retail datarevenues come from business applications driven by laptop AIR cards and email.Quarterly revenues from these applications are showing strong sequential growthand were up nearly 74% compared with a year ago.  Messaging revenues, which make up just less than half of allof our retail data, continue to grow steadily, up 58% versus last year. Duringthe quarter, customers sent or received more than 36 billion text messages, upfrom 28 billion in the second quarter. Data applications such as Get It Now, VCast,mobile web and ringback tones are also generating significant growth.  Verizon wireless continues to lead the industry in retailcustomers, total revenue, customer loyalty and profitability. On slide 8 youcan see steady increase in quarterly revenues, now well in excess of $11billion. In terms of the data opportunity, while we are seeing strong demand,we certainly see more upside. For example, only a little more than half of ourretail customers have a broadband capable device.  We have recently previewed some great new devices -- the LGVoyager and Venus, the Samsung Juke and the world's first high-speed BlackBerryPearl. These and other devices will be part of our strongest lineup ever forthe fourth quarter. In August we announced an innovative partnership with MTVand RealNetworks which will further differentiate our mobile music service.  Our EBITDA was $4.4 billion this quarter, up 14.3% sincelast year and our EBITDA margin was a very strong 44.7%. All in all, anotherexcellent quarter for Verizon wireless. Let's move to wireline. Within wireline we had a strongquarter of residential customer growth, particularly with our FiOS services. InFiOS TV we added 202,000 net new customers this quarter, about 21% more thanour second quarter net adds. That is an average of about 3,200 net adds perbusiness day for the quarter.  As of September 30, we were marketing FiOS TV service toabout 4.7 million homes, up from 3.9 million at the end of the second quarter.We now have 717,000 TV customers representing a penetration of more than 15%.In virtually all of our regional markets we have achieved double-digitpenetration and in one region, our TV penetration exceeds 30%. With respect to revenues, our FiOS TV ARPU has increasedconsistently each quarter and compares well to industry norms. We are alsoseeing great customer acceptance of FiOS Internet service. During the thirdquarter, we added 229,000 net new FiOS Internet customers, representing about a13% increase over last quarter and an average of about 3,600 net adds perbusiness day. We now have 1.3 million FiOS Internet customers, representing apenetration of 20% of the 6.5 million homes open for sale. In all of ourregions, we have reached penetration rates of 13% or better with two-thirds ofour regions exceeding 20% penetration. Last week we announced the new symmetrical FiOS Internetservice featuring upload and download speeds of up to 20 Mbps. This uploadspeed is unmatched with nothing else even close.  Total broadband subscribers increased to 8 million in thethird quarter, up 1.4 million or about 21% from a year ago. During the quarter,there were 285,000 net broadband adds. As I noted, 229,000 of these net addswere FiOS Internet customers. Our DSL net adds this quarter were 56,000.Overall, FiOS TV and broadband, as well as our bundling initiatives, areresulting in net customer growth. The total number of primary consumer units grew 1.8% year overyear, and we ended the quarter with 32.3 million total RGUs which were modestlyhigher than a year ago. On an absolute basis, our total line losses thisquarter increased sequentially, but were fewer than the amount we lost in thethird quarter last year. Retail residential line losses of 664,000 were more than welost last quarter but are 4.5% less than we lost a year ago. Today, about 72%of the 6.5 million FiOS homes open for sale can get the triple play from us. Aswe continue to increase the availability of FiOS TV, we are seeing anincreasing correlation to improve line retention.  We are encouraged by the fact that in highly penetratedvideo markets, access line retention is significantly better. Take Rhode Island, for example. We began offering FiOS TV inparts of the state earlier this year. In those markets where we offer FiOS TV,we are actually seeing access line gains; where only six months ago we werelosing lines in excess of 10% annually. Our consumer retail business is increasingly centered onbroadband, video and bundles. As you can see on slide 10, our legacy consumerrevenue growth was positive again this quarter, increasing 3.1%. Year-to-date,legacy consumer revenues have increased by about $300 million. Increases inbroadband and video revenue and an increase in the number of bundled customershave all helped drive consumer retail ARPU up $5.73 or nearly 11% year over year.All of our regional markets had sequential ARPU accretion.  In total, broadband and video revenues were up 67% thisquarter compared with a year ago. Last quarter the year-over-year growth ratewas 55%. We continue to see growth and retention opportunities as we increasetriple play availability, and we have begun adding wireless to the mix. Inearly October we announced some great new home and wireless bundles. Now let's take a lot at Verizon business on slide 11. Wecontinue to see strong growth in data demand and some stabilization in voicepricing. Our 2.2% revenue increase is the fourth consecutive quarter ofpositive year-over-year revenue growth. In enterprise -- which includes premiermultinational customers, domestic and government accounts -- revenues grew to$3.7 billion, up 2.4% year over year and 1.3% sequentially.  Wholesale domestic revenues grew 3.7% year over year,primarily due to increases in wireless traffic. International revenues, whichinclude both retail and wholesale, were $789 million. This is the same as lastquarter and down $4 million versus last year. Retail revenues increased, butwere offset by volume declines in wholesale.  Strategic services showed strong revenue growth again thisquarter, up 28.6% versus last year and 8% higher on a sequential basis. Growthwas driven by private IP, managed services and security. Strategic services arebecoming a much larger piece of the overall revenue stream. It is now more than25% of total Verizon business, up from 20% a year ago. With the majority of ourcustomers transitioning to IP, we continue to see significant opportunities toincrease our market share. We believe we are very well-positioned to takeadvantage of the global demand for IP, managed services, security and hosting. Overall, we believe this quarter provides further evidencethat our strategies are paying off in the wireline business. On the residentialside, even though line losses continue, we have successfully increased revenueper customer, which has resulted in improved revenue growth. In Verizon business,we continue to win new business and increase market share.  And as you can see on slide 12, wireline revenues havecontinued to show steady improvement as the year-over-year rate of decline haslessened each quarter. Third quarter revenues declined 0.8%; excluding formerMCI mass-market, wireline revenues actually increased 0.9%. As in wireless, dataservices are a big driver of revenue growth. Data now represents 37% of total wirelinerevenue. This quarter, data revenues were up 13% year over year. In terms of profitability, third quarter wireline operatingincome margins expanded 60 basis points year over year and 40 basis pointssequentially to 9.4%. Margin expansion is being driven by revenue growth, aswell as a number of productivity initiatives currently underway. Wireline headcount is down more than 2,800 for the year.FiOS earnings solution declined sequentially to $0.09. We are pleased with ourprogress in improving installation productivity and expect to see betterefficiencies as we gain scale. So we're making good progress in improvingprofitability. So let's wrap this up and get to your questions. If I take astep back and look at the big picture, I would say that our focus on revenuegrowth, productivity and margin expansion is clearly taking hold. Our growth inearnings from continuing operations is solidly in the double-digits. All keygrowth areas are performing well.  Wireless had another strong quarter in terms of profitablerevenue and customer growth, as well as strong cash generation. In wireline,revenues and margins continue to improve. In the consumer market, ourbroadband, video and bundling initiatives are driving ARPU expansion and demandfor our FiOS services has never been better. We are well positioned to increasemarket share and capitalize on growth opportunities in Verizon business.  Our strong balance sheet gives us the financial flexibilityto continue investing for growth and at the same time return capital toshareowners. In September we raised the dividend by 6.2% or $0.10 annually, aclear indication of the confidence we have in our cash outlook. We haveincreased our share repurchase program target to at least $2.5 billion for thefull year, up about $500 million from our original guidance.  In sum, good progress in key strategic areas and we arepleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results.  With that, I will turn it back to Ron.\nRon Lataille: Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Denny and Doreen are now availableto take questions.\nOperator: Your first question comes from David Barden - Banc ofAmerica Securities.\nDavid Barden - Banc of America Securities: First on the wireline margins, up it looks like 50 basispoints sequentially. Is it all just incremental FiOS revenues that are movingthe margin up there? What are the moving parts behind that margin? Asimportantly, where do you think that those wireline margins can go over thenext year? If you could just talk to the FCC talking about getting ridof the exclusive contracts between cable companies and multi-tenant dwellingunit landlords. Is that a barrier to getting more aggressive in the MDUfootprint with the FiOS product, or are there still technological barriers tobe overcome? Thanks a lot.\nDenny Strigl:  I will handle both ofthose. First of all, on the margin question, obviously we have made progressthis quarter. We saw margins better than the last quarter. But to be candidwith you, I'm not satisfied with that. We are working to improve our marginsevery day and I am confident that we will see continued improvement. The teamis very focused on productivity improvements and overall reduction in cost. So looking at the opportunities that we have to improvemargins, FiOS metrics were on target to be EBITDA positive in '08. Reducingaccess costs in Verizon Business will also help. We will get our EBITDA marginsto at least 14% to 15% in the next couple of years. Also, we have some cost reductionopportunities across the business, including real estate, procurement sourcingand through IT in aggressively transforming some of the transaction-relatedoperations. So for the fourth quarter and '08, we are very focused oncontinuing to drive growth, top line revenues and overall increasing ourmargins. On the MDU issue, there really are no technology areas thatare in our way in MDUs. The issues for us with MDUs are first to get a premiseaccess license arrangement. That is, permission to get into a building withFiOS. Secondly, with the landlords marketing agreement, that is the ability tomarket within the building. Finally, to sign up customers. Of course, all ofthis is gated upon our ability to get a video franchise. Some statistics you may be interested in, about 25% of our accesslines are in MDUs. Thus far, we have cast about 2.1 million MDUs, and we haveopened 400,000. We're feeling pretty good about where we stand, and we arelooking for a strong result in '08.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns.\nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: First on the wireless side, we saw the iPhone price cut in mid-September-ish.Can you give us sense for how your margins reacted throughout the quarter andwhether or not you had a competitive response? More importantly, looking intoQ4 and the holiday season where I think we will have a number of iPhone sales,is there something we should be looking at from your margins as to how you'regoing to respond to that threat? Secondly, on the business access lines, it looked like anout of trend, worse than normal quarter, on a year-over-year percentage declinebasis. Is there something there from cable companies, or is there an impactfrom a softer economy we should be thinking about? Thanks.\nDenny Strigl:  On the iPhonequestion, Mike, we have seen minimal impact in the iPhone thus far. We did see,as we mentioned last quarter, an initial jump in our local number portabilityrates and quickly after two to three weeks, back to normal. We saw the sameoccur when the price was lowered on the iPhone. I think as you see from ourchurn number, not appreciably different than what you have seen in other thirdquarters. So relative to iPhone, we don't see any major impact on our business. Now as Doreen mentioned in her initial comments, we have avery aggressive fourth quarter planned in terms of introduction of newproducts. A product called the Voyager, which we think will be a very closecompetitive offer to the iPhone; but a number of the other handsets that arebeing introduced in the quarter. I think all are fairly priced, and we lookforward to a good fourth quarter and are not overly concerned about the impactof the iPhone.\nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: Denny, before we move off wireless, can you just give us anindication of what the wholesale disconnect issue was this quarter?\nDenny Strigl:  We have overall anumber of wholesale customers, but two large ones. The major disconnects havecome from the two major resellers that we have, as you might guess, and it is justan issue on pricing and volumes, Mike. Nothing extraordinary there; as you seeour last few quarters, we have taken some disconnect on the wholesale side. Noreal change in our strategy relative to resellers.\nDoreen Toben: On the business access line, Mike, what I would say is therewas nothing unusual. There was no big tick-up from competition. I think youhave to be really careful with the business access line number. At least 50% ofit is enterprise, which is really not a relevant measure because there are so manyprivate lines going to DS1s, DS3s or OC12s or whatnot. So nothing unusual thathappened on the business line access line side.\nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns:  When you look at thenumbers, you have not had a decline of 3.8% since early 2004. So I just thoughtthat was unusual.\nDoreen Toben: Yes, but as I said, nothing unusual. I think it is much moreon the enterprise side of the house that it was on the small business side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik - UBS.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: First on FiOS, the dilution there seems to be coming downabout $0.01 a quarter, and you are obviously sticking with the EBITDA positiveguidance for '08. The changes we should see over the next 12 months, is thatmore a function of scale or improving cost metrics in terms of installationtimes, marketing, that kind of thing? Second of all on the business, growth slowed a bit duringthe quarter. Are there any underlying trends we should know about there, or howdo you expect the growth to shape up in that segment over the next 12 months?\nDenny Strigl: John, on the overall FiOS where do we go from here, I thinkthat we definitely will be ramping up, particularly with a greater number ofhomes passed. Actually, we are rolling out FiOS probably as fast as we can atthis point. We still have some major urban markets to open in the next 18 to 24months, which will significantly expand our opportunities. Frankly, we're notgating our FiOS rollout from a dilution or a franchise perspective. So the answer to your question in general is yes, we will beramping FiOS even further with more homes passed. Productivity has improvedacross the board in all of our regions, but there's still more work to do inthat regard.\nDoreen Toben: I would just add on the FiOS dilution question, you heardthat it is still going to be EBITDA positive in '08. I would say we are ontrack with where we thought we would be, and it is a mix, John. We haveproductivity improvements that will drive the number, as well as the fact asyou continue to get scale. We still have a lot more states and areas that weare opening up, of which the longer that you are in a particular region and youexpand it, your costs come down. So the answer would be a mix.\nDenny Strigl: John, on the Verizon Business growth, the question that youasked, absolute revenues increased sequentially and the growth rate down onlyabout 10 basis points. In that regard, there's nothing really to note. We arenot seeing any change in our metrics or our sales funnels that would indicate aslowdown. We're encouraged that strategic services continued to show verystrong growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins - Citigroup.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup: Good morning. On the DSL, can you talk about the slowdown inDSL out of the FiOS region? What impact FiOS might be having on the straightDSL product? Is it more of an industry or competitive issue? And is it one alsoI guess that could be economic?\nDenny Strigl: Michael, good morning. We are really not seeing any overalldecline in our broadband metrics, and I think we need to look first at thetotal broadband market rather than just DSL alone. So this quarter we sawcontinued healthy growth in broadband. Broadband subs year over year were up21%. We have 8 million broadband customers in total. We added 285,000 newcustomers this quarter and about 1.4 million over the last 12 months. I thinkDoreen mentioned in her comments that we are adding about 3,600 FiOS Internetsubs per day. In fact, FiOS alone took more than 40,000 DSL subs in the thirdquarter. So just a couple of other comments on this. Looking at thepercent of homes covered by FiOS Internet and video, those number of homes areincreasing. FiOS Internet now covers about 20% of households in our footprint.That is up 35% since the beginning of the year, and our availability of FiOSvideo has doubled this year to 15% of households. So overall, we continue toexpect strong broadband growth going forward, and this will particularly relateto the increased coverage that we have.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup: When you look at the FiOS adds only about 20% of that comingfrom DSL, does that mean that you're taking significantly more share from cablecompetition when you're adding high-speed Internet customers to the fiberproduct?\nDenny Strigl: As you might guess, from cable and also some new to thecategory, but the answer to your question would be yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - MorganStanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Denny, first on wireless, the cost of services and sales wasup about 8% sequentially. What is driving that? Is that equipment subsidies, orare there other things going on there, some seasonality?  Doreen, could you just take us below the operating incomeline and talk about the tax rate? It seems to have come down a bit. What weshould expect for fourth quarter and if there's anything unusual in equity andunconsolidated or other income expense?\nDenny Strigl: Yes, to answer your question on the wireless costs, that isprimarily handset-driven; obviously greater functionality in the handsets andhigher costs.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley:  Should that persistin Q4?\nDenny Strigl:  I think you canexpect this to continue in the fourth quarter.\nDoreen Toben: On the tax rate, I think we had some out of periodadjustments this quarter. We were able to amend some of our prior tax returns,which allowed us to record a benefit for additional foreign tax credits. I would say for the full year, I have notchanged the 35% to 37% range. However, in the fourth quarter, you will probablysee a rate that is lower than the average of the first three quarters. I actually think that you're going to see a 35%to 37% go through 2008 as well. So you will see a little bit of a higher taxrate. We can take you through a lot of what is below. Op incomehas to do with CANTV in particular and Omnitel one-timers that happens eitherthis year or last year. CANTV does not book in the same place PRTC orDominicana did. So I think those are the two units that really caused the \u201clooksfunny\u201d that you might see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan - CIBC.\nTim Horan - CIBC: The wireless data was a very, very strong quarter, probably thestrongest we have seen, maybe ever. Could you give us some more color aroundthat, and where do you think that can get to as a percentage of revenue? I might have missed it, but Doreen, could you tell us whatthe FiOS dilution was this year?\nDenny Strigl: First, if you look at the number of data capable devicescoming into the market this of course, is a big driver. About 50% of our retailsubs currently have a broadband capable device, so we think there is lots ofopportunity there. The second driver is also that we're seeing new applicationscoming into the market. Obviously we will see customers increasingly use thoseapplications. We now see about 35% of our retail data revenues coming frombusiness applications, and that is up significantly from the prior year. But I might point out that messaging revenues continuestrong growth, about 50% to 60% remarkably each quarter. About 68% of ourretail customers are now data users. So to your question, where do we go long term here?Eventually we can see that we may hit the 30% range, and a lot of factors inthat coming into play. The capable handsets, deeper penetration of our productsand a rollout of new services, just to name a few. Our wireless team continuesto be highly focused on growth in data ARPU overall.\nTim Horan - CIBC:  But it seems like thetrends, I'm very surprised how strong it has been, but might even be like a 35%longer-term number. I know you're not putting it out there now, but do youthink that is possible?\nDenny Strigl:  It is possible.\nDoreen Toben:  Tim, in case youmissed it, on the FiOS, it was $0.11 first quarter, $0.10 second quarter and$0.09 third quarter.\nTim Horan - CIBC:  Can you break thatout EBITDA versus depreciation? Is there any way to get color on that?\nDoreen Toben:  No, I mean we arethinking about whether next year we will just show EBITDA if we show anything,but not off the top of my head as far as that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch.\nDavid Janazzo - Merrill Lynch:  A couple of weeks agothere was some reference in the news to a meeting between Verizon and Google.Presumably it relates to 700 megahertz option, maybe wireless broadband in thefuture. In general, how are you thinking about opportunities to partner, and interms of at Verizon and at Google, what could each party do you think bring tothe other?\nDenny Strigl: First of all, as you would expect, we meet with lots ofcompanies and people all of the time, including companies like Google. Frankly,we don't have any other comments, and as you know, it is our policy not tocomment on rumors, or discussions that we may or may not have had. So I think Iwill leave it at that.\nDavid Janazzo - Merrill Lynch:  Anything justgenerally on what you could bring to a company like that or what they couldbring to you?\nDenny Strigl:  I have no furthercomment on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers.\nTom Seitz - Lehman Brothers: When you look at what is going on in places like Rhode Island where you have rolled out FiOS and you'reactually increasing access lines, are you tempted at all to push back thedilution estimates such that you can take advantage of a product that has gotreal momentum right now? I mean listening to the cable operators on theearnings call, their change in tone of perception about FiOS is remarkable. Secondly, can you update us as to where we are in gettingmargin improvement out of the system integration with MCI and the access linesavings from the CapEx spend this year? I mean not to get perfectly exact, butcan you give us a sense of perhaps maybe what inning we are at in terms ofrecognizing those improvements?\nDoreen Toben: Denny went through some of this, but I would say as far asincreasing FiOS deployment, at the moment at least we are about going as fastas we think we can. We do have, as you mentioned, some urban markets that wehope to open up in the next 18 to 24 months. That will significantly expand ouropportunities. I would say that from a rollout perspective, we are not tryingto manage dilution based on the rollout. So if we wanted to roll out quicker,we would go ahead and do that.\nDenny Strigl: I will comment on the synergy targets. For Verizon businessin 2007 we're planning about $900 million in synergies. That is up,incidentally, from an original target of $825 million. In the third quarter ofthis year, approximately $300 million in synergies.\nDoreen Toben: Yes, and then I guess if you ask me what inning, I would saywe are probably with a three-year program so we have got one more year to go,and we think we will be where we need to be.\nRon Lataille:  Operator, that willconclude our call for today. Thank you, everybody for joining us."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-07-30 12:22:55", "content": "TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :\nExecutives: Ron Lataille - IR   Ivan Seidenberg - Chairman and CEO   Denny Strigl - President and COO   Doreen Toben \u2013 CFO \nAnalysts:  Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse   Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns   David Barden - Banc of America Securities   John Hodulik - UBS   Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley   Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs   Michael Rollins - Citigroup   David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch   Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers \nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, SVP Investor Relations of Verizon. \n Ron Lataille: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and CEO; Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.  This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.  I would now like to turn the call over to Ivan Seidenberg for some opening remarks. \nIvan Seidenberg: Thank you and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your dialing in this morning. In just a moment, we will go over our quarterly results. We're pleased with the performance there, and you will see that we have lots to talk with you about on our performance in the second quarter.  You also know that we just announced this morning an acquisition of Rural Cellular Corporation's assets. I thought at the beginning of the call, we would take just a moment to provide you with some information and some color about this. Rural is an attractive corporation. They operate in the 850 megahertz cellular footprint. We understood over the past several days that they wanted to complete their transaction and the sale of the company by this weekend.  This is an asset that we have had under some surveillance for awhile. We constantly look at these things. We thought there was a significant synergy opportunity for our company. It would provide a meaningful expansion of our footprint, as well as improve service for our existing Verizon Wireless customers. Of course, we believe that the valuations for both Rural\u2019s shareholders and Verizon\u2019s shareholders were in line, and therefore, we moved forward over the weekend.  Just a couple of quick details about the transaction. As you read in the press release, purchase price was $2.67 billion, $45 per share. Broken down the equity price is $757 million; the residual of that is debt, for a combined total of enterprise value of $2.67 billion. The $45 represents a 16% premium over the last ten trading days and a 41% premium over the closing price on Friday. We think there are opportunities for more than $1 billion in synergies through reduced roaming and operating expense savings. We think obviously this transaction will be attractive to our shareholders. It will be neutral to modestly accretive in 2008 and accretive in 2009 and thereafter.  One interesting point about this is the customer base for Rural is over 700,000. They operate in about 15 states. We think regulatory approvals will take some time during the second quarter, no later than the first half of '08. Lastly, this company operates both GSM and CDMA networks. Our plan would be -- just to make sure there's clarity about it -- would be to build an overlay CDMA network, convert their existing customers to CDMA, but we will continue to operate the GSM network to serve the roaming needs of the GSM carriers that utilize those facilities.  We're excited about the transaction. We think it was opportunistic. Rural is a good company. We think this is very attractive for Verizon shareholders both strategically and financially. So with that, Ron, let's go back to the routine call, and we will pick up on the quarterly results. Thank you. \nRon Lataille: Thank you, Ivan. Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I would like to point out that both reported and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.58 for the second quarter. The only special item that we're excluding from adjusted results is relatively small, a $17 million after-tax charge for merger integration costs.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. \nDoreen Toben: Thanks, Ron and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were strong and we sustained our momentum. Verizon Wireless had an excellent quarter with a continuation of their very strong growth in customers, revenues, margins and cash flow. We also saw higher wireline revenue growth in both consumer and global enterprise services. Top line growth continued to accelerate this quarter as consolidated revenues grew 6.5% compared with last year.  We also improved margins as operating income increased 14.9% year-over-year. Our $0.58 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations resulted in another quarter of double-digit growth, up 11.5% from a year ago. For the first half of the year, EPS from continuing operations grew 13.1%.  Let's take a closer look at consolidated revenues and margins. Our accelerating growth has resulted in a $2.6 billion increase in consolidated revenues year-to-date. 90% of our revenue base had positive year-over-year growth. In the second quarter, we continued to see organic growth across all business units. Verizon Wireless revenues were up 17.1%, legacy consumer revenues grew 3.4% and Verizon Business had 2.4% growth. Operating income grew to $8.1 billion in the first half, an increase of $1.2 billion versus last year. So, as you can see, very profitable revenue growth as we continued to drive the business to accelerate revenues and expand margins.  Cash flows from continuing operations in the quarter were strong. Our first-half total of $11.6 billion represents 7.5% growth over last year. Total debt was $32.5 billion at the end of the quarter, down $2.2 billion since last quarter and just under $10 billion lower than a year ago.  We have continued to repurchase shares. During the quarter we bought back more than 500 million of our common stock. In early July we passed the 1 billion mark for the year. Again, our intention is to repurchase at least 2 billion over the course of this year. Our capital spending was on target at $8.5 billion for the first six months with both wireline and wireless right where we expected them to be. You see the improvement in our CapEx to revenue ratio this year compared to last.  Let's begin our segment review with wireless on slide 6. As you know, the retail market is our key focus. More customers use Verizon Wireless than any other wireless brand. We had another strong quarter of customer growth with more than 1.6 million retail net adds, increasing our retail customer base to 60.1 million or 96.8% of total. Retail postpaid customer grew 1.5 million to 57.7 million.  We continued our industry leadership in customer loyalty. Retail churn was 1.08%, and retail postpaid churn was a record low, 0.85%. Retail gross adds increased 2.2% year over year and were up nearly a 1% sequentially with more than two-thirds of these retail sales coming from direct channels. Total net adds for the quarter, including wholesale, were 1.3 million. During the quarter the wholesale customer base declined by about 300,000 primarily due to one reseller. We have removed all customers associated with this reseller from our subscriber counts this quarter.  Turning to slide 7, total service revenues were up 17% in the second quarter, sustaining our strong growth trends and marking the sixth consecutive quarter of better than 15% year-over-year growth. Retail service ARPU of $51.84 was up 3% year over year and 2.2% sequentially. This growth is the highest we have seen in the past two years.  Data products and services continue to be a significant driver of growth. In fact, more than half of the growth in total service revenues was from data. Data revenues grew 70% year-over-year and represented 19% of total service revenue, up from 13% a year ago. Retail data ARPU grew to $9.84, up 48% from a year ago. Almost two-thirds of our retail customers are data users. More than one-third of all retail data revenues came from business applications, and nearly 60% of our data revenue growth was from services other than messaging.  During the quarter customers using our VCast service completed about 25 million music and video downloads. Customers sent or received over 28 billion text messages in the second quarter with 10 billion in the month of June alone.  Verizon Wireless continues to lead the industry in retail customers, total revenue, customer loyalty and profitability. As you can see on slide 8, we have sustained a steady growth trajectory in revenues which were $10.8 billion in the second quarter. Quarterly EBITDA was well in excess of $4 billion, up 8% sequentially and 21% since last year. Our second quarter EBITDA margin was a very strong 45.8%, and we intend to sustain our leadership by differentiating ourselves from the competition.  Earlier this month we announced that we have expanded Rev. A to 100% of our EV-DO footprint, which covers more than 210 million pops. In May we introduced our global BlackBerry service and the new BlackBerry 8830 world addition. Both of these have been extremely well-received as we are getting great feedback from customers, particularly business travelers. We have enhanced our music capabilities with VCast Online service, which enables over-the-air recognition of tunes for digital downloading, and our VCast Mobile TV service is now available in more than 30 markets. All-in-all another excellent quarter for wireless.  Within wireline we had a strong quarter of residential customer growth, particularly with our FiOS services. We also saw some line loss improvement. In FiOS TV we added 167,000 net new customers to end the quarter with 515,000, a penetration of more than 13%. That is an average of about 2,600 net adds per business day this quarter. When you add in our DirecTV bundled customers, we now have nearly 1.3 million video subscribers. At the end of the quarter, we were marketing our FiOS TV service to about 3.9 million homes, up from 3.1 million at the end of first quarter and our FiOS TV ARPUs remain within industry norms.  We are also doing well with our FiOS Internet service. We added 203,000 net new FiOS Internet customers this quarter, which is about 15% more net adds than in the first quarter. We now have 1.1 million customers representing a penetration of 19% of homes open for sale. During the quarter, we averaged about 3,200 net adds per business day. Six of our state markets have FiOS Internet penetration rates over 20% and one state exceeds 35%. In virtually all markets, except those in which we've just introduced the service, we reached double-digit penetration.  Total broadband subscribers increased to 7.7 million in the second quarter, up 1.6 million or about 26% from a year ago. During the quarter there were 288,000 net broadband heads. As I noted, 203,000 of these net adds were FiOS Internet customers. Although we usually see seasonally slower DSL net adds in the second quarter, this quarter's 85,000 DSL net adds were lower than consensus. However, as we continue to scale up the availability of FiOS, some reduction in DSL volumes should be expected. Overall about 22% of FiOS Internet sales are migrations up from DSL service.  Overall FiOS TV and broadband, as well as our bundling initiatives, are improving customer growth trends. The total number of primary consumer units grew 2% year-over-year, and we ended the quarter with 32.4 million total RGUs, which are up on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. We have also seen an increase in retail residential bundled customers this past year. Clearly broadband and video products have proven to be more retentive, and we have seen some improvement in line losses this quarter, which is certainly a change from recent trends. The amount of total quarterly line losses have improved by 15% since the second quarter last year. On a percentage basis, the 7.8% year-over-year decline is also slightly better than last quarter.  Of note, the improvements were in retail lines and can be attributed to an aggressive retention program as well as win-back efforts. More specifically, retail residential line losses have improved sequentially on both an absolute and percentage basis. During the quarter, we lost 579,000 lines or 9.2% year over year. This compares with 619,000 lines or 9.3% at the end of first quarter. Clearly we see a correlation between FiOS penetration and line loss improvements in some markets.  Our consumer retail business is increasingly centered on broadband, video and bundles. As I mentioned earlier, our legacy consumer revenue growth was positive again this quarter, increasing 3.4%, more than doubling the rate of growth in first quarter. Broadband and video revenues grew 55% this quarter compared with the year ago. Last quarter that growth rate was 46%.  Increases in broadband and video revenue, more bundled customers, as well as certain strategic pricing changes all helped drive consumer retail ARPU up $5.64 or nearly 11% year over year. The 3.3% sequential growth in ARPU is primarily broadband and video-related. In Texas the retail ARPU growth was in excess of 20%, and there are several other large markets with double-digit growth including New York, New Jersey and Virginia. We continue to see growth and retention opportunities in the retail consumer market, particularly as we introduced new bundles, many of which will include wireless.  Let's turn now to Verizon Business on slide 11 where we are taking advantage of the positive trends in the large enterprise market to increase market share. In discussions with investors over the past few months, there seems to be less focus here than any of our other units. Our opportunities in this market should not be overlooked. Verizon Business revenues now represent 23% of our consolidated year-to-date total; which, by the way, is about 40% larger than our legacy consumer unit and there is significant upside potential here.  Our 2.4% revenue increase is the third consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth, and we're seeing this growth across all units: enterprise, wholesale and international. In enterprise, which includes premier multinational customers as well as domestic and government accounts, revenues grew to $3.7 billion, up 2.7% sequentially and 2.8% year over year. Wholesale revenues, which are domestic only, grew 1.6% since last year to $844 million. International revenues, which includes services from non U.S.-based retail and wholesale customers, were just under $800 million, up 1.3% year over year.  Strategic services posted a 25.5% revenue increase over last year. As you can see on slide 12, strategic services is also showing strong sequential growth, increasing 9.3% over first quarter. This grouping of services which includes IP, managed services, as well as Ethernet and optical ring services, are becoming a much more larger percentage of total Verizon Business, currently representing 24% of total, up from 19% a year ago.  We saw strong growth in a number of products including private IP, contact center solutions and Ethernet services. Revenues also increased in managed services like enhanced 911, IP VPN and security solutions. The year-over-year growth in strategic services revenues exceeded the decline in core service revenues for the second consecutive quarter. We believe this is significant, and we are very focused on continuing this trend.  As noted last quarter, the impact of rate writedowns from renewal contracts is improving; nearly a 40% reduction in the rate of decline from a year ago. With the majority of our customers transitioning to IP, we see significant opportunities to increase our market share. We believe we are very well-positioned to take advantage of the global demand for IP, managed services, security and hosting.  The wireline business model continues to evolve. Even though we have fewer customers in total, we have increased the revenue or value per customer. This has resulted in improved revenue growth. Revenues have continued to show steady improvement as the year-over-year rate of decline has lessened each quarter. Second quarter revenues declined 1.1%, a significant top line improvement from a 6.2% decline a year ago. Excluding former MCI mass market, wireline revenues actually increased 0.6%.  As in wireless, data services are a big driver of growth in wireline revenues. Data now represents 35% of total wireline revenues. This quarter data revenues grew an impressive 11.6%. Our wireline operating income margins were essentially flat on a sequential basis and down 60 basis points versus last year. The year-over-year change is due primarily to FiOS customer growth and the cost of provisioning significantly more new customers in the current quarter than a year ago.  Our focus on growth by driving ARPU and improving customer retention carried with it some higher marketing and advertising costs this quarter, when viewed on a sequential basis. We are sharply focused on driving continuous improvements in our cost structure, not only in FiOS provisioning but throughout the entire wireline unit. We continue to target margin expansion in 2007 and beyond. FiOS earnings declined sequentially to $0.10. We are pleased with our progress in this area and expect productivity improvement to continue as we gain scale.  A few concluding comments, and then we will answer questions. Growth is accelerating in all our key markets. Two-thirds of our revenues now come from wireless and global business. As I said earlier, 90% of our revenue base is growing. In the consumer market, our broadband, video and bundling initiatives are driving ARPU expansion and improving retention. We are building very positive momentum in FiOS, and we have many growth opportunities ahead of us. We're making good progress in improving profitability. We still have work to do, but wireless margins remain the highest in the industry. Our strong balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and return capital to shareowners.  In summary, we are very pleased with our second-quarter and first-half results, making us very confident as we enter the second half of the year. With that, I will turn it back to Ron so we can answer your questions. \n Ron Lataille: Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Ivan, Denny and Doreen are now available to take questions. \nOperator: Your first question comes from Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse. \n Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse: Thanks and good morning. A couple of questions on the Rural Cellular transaction, if you don't mind. Ivan, I think you said in your comments that they wanted to get the transaction wrapped up by this weekend. Is there anything specific of why that had to be done?  Secondly, how was the transaction going to be structured in relation to how it impacts the Vodafone relationship? Will this be all-cash out of Verizon Wireless and it does not change that?  Third, Doreen, on the synergies that you outlined of about $1 billion, can you break those synergies down between the roaming synergies and the actual operating call synergies that might come out of that? \nIvan Seidenberg: I will deal with that, Chris. On the first question, I think they had a process that has been open since May, and I think they felt that they wanted to get it completed. I think they had indicated they were looking to close it during the window prior to August 10 or 11, I believe. So there was nothing unusual as far as we were concerned, and we were able to move quickly and seize the opportunity. But I think this was really driven by the seller, and you might check with them, but we detected nothing unusual about it.  This will be an acquisition made by Verizon Wireless, and Vodafone enthusiastically supported it. We obviously covered it with them at a Verizon Wireless board meeting.  At this point, it is probably premature on the synergy question. I think we have over $1 billion. Over the course of the next six to eight months, it will be clear what that breakdown might look like, but you should expect that the vast majority of those savings will come from savings in roaming. \n Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse: A second one on the wireless side. Data ARPU continues to grow very rapidly. Could you give us as sense for what the ARPU growth might be without data cards? Are the data cards, the EV-DO cards, a big driver of the data growth, or is it mostly the messaging? \nDenny Strigl: It is mostly the messaging at this point. \n Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns. \n Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns : On the consumer side, just looking at the revenue growth opportunity there, how much longer do we have before the old MCI legacy consumer stuff rolls off?  Second on the enterprise side, I guess the trend there is slowing down a bit. So maybe you can give us a sense for the puts and takes there whether it is product mix shift that is impacting that or contract repricing really hit in the past quarter? Thanks. \nDoreen Toben: I will start with the consumer piece of it. They have sort of been down 25 to 30% each quarter. I think this is going to continue to roll at those kinds of levels into '08 and probably into '09. So it will take actually a couple of years before we think it rolls off in total. \nIvan Seidenberg: Mike, if you look overall at the VZB revenue growth, market and customer spending trends continue to be strong. We have completed over 50% of the IP migration, and after the migration, we're seeing stronger revenues. We are also, as we reported last quarter, seeing longer contracts with less pricing pressures, and we see improved global opportunities as we continue to focus on the multinational accounts. \n Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns : Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden - Banc of America Securities. \n David Barden - Banc of America Securities : Just on the consumer wireline, legacy wireline business, a couple of important inflections. One is on the line losses. I am wondering if you believe that that is related to a saturation effect in market share, if you will, the beginning of a saturation effect and whether you expect this can continue? The same question on DSL. Big slowdown there, obviously seasonal trends; probably people are waiting around for FiOS to show up, but are you starting to see some saturation there?  If I can ask a follow-up on that prior question on business. A lot of questions about where we are in the business cycle, Denny. Are we seeing the enterprise business start to roll over, or are we seeing some incremental strength? Are we building or diminishing on that segment? Thanks a lot. \nIvan Seidenberg: David, several questions there. Let me again begin with the access line loss question. First, I would say that access lines did not improve enough, and we continue to be focused on improving our access line losses. The improvement that we did experience was not unexpected. It comes from a rollout of FiOS and bundles and a great focus in the business on retention and win back. So we expect to lose fewer lines.  Looking at the DSL question, I agree that 85,000 net adds were lighter than what they should have been this quarter. As Doreen mentioned, as FiOS scales up, we do expect to see a reduction in DSL volumes. But I would also add that DSL was frankly not our focus this quarter. We quickly moved and trained service reps, installation forces that normally handled DSL, we moved them to FiOS in some markets like New Jersey, California, Florida, also Indiana toward the end of the quarter. So overall we expect broadband net adds to continue to grow, and we will roll out FiOS just as fast as we can. We are also back-filling on the DSL side, the service reps and the installation forces that we move. So our expectation is going forward more focus and better DSL results.  On the enterprise side, you ask if the business cycle is rollover or incremental. I think as we said last quarter, we are not the market share leader in the business market so we are tending to take more share from our competitors. I think this is a good story for us. We are seeing some rollover signup business, but frankly we have got some very good growth opportunity in taking share from our competitors. \nDavid Barden - Banc of America Securities: Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik - UBS. \n John Hodulik - UBS : Thanks, good morning. Just a quick question on wireline margins. Doreen, during your remarks you mentioned that you were going to focus on some cost cutting. We also saw the FiOS dilution come down in the quarter. Can you give a little bit of a forward-looking view of how would you expect that to trend? I know that you've got quite a bit lower EBITDA margins than some of your wireline compatriots. How do you expect that to trend, not only through the end of the year but maybe into '08 as well? \nIvan Seidenberg: Okay. John, if we look at the overall margins, they were flat, even given the lower FiOS dilution that we experienced. So they were flat sequentially, but this was not unexpected. And, in fact, we have said that we would see some lumpiness in our margins. As Doreen mentioned, we have been accelerating growth in our legacy consumer services in the small business and also in enterprise. Although some of the expenses were up for the quarter, marketing expenses in particular, I am confident that we will continue to drive our top line growth to the bottom line. We continue to be very focused on improvement in productivity and also cost reductions going forward. \n John Hodulik - UBS : Are those marketing expenses expected to continue to reoccur throughout the rest of the year, or is it just a second quarter issue? \nIvan Seidenberg: No, it is not a second quarter issue. Our marketing expenses will be up probably on the level like we have seen in the second quarter. But I also think that our continued productivity improvements and cost reductions we will continue to see in the third and fourth quarter of this year. \n John Hodulik - UBS : Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley. \n Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Thanks a lot, good morning. Doreen, very strong wireless margins. You have given a guidance range here of the mid-40s, low-40s over the last several quarters. Is there a chance here that we can -- if the trend stays down here -- take that margin up to a new higher range, or is this sort of the upper end of the range and it will stabilize from here in the second half? \nDoreen Toben: Hi Simon. No, I think we're going to stay with our 43% to 45% margin and guidance, so no change to that really. \n Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : So what was it this quarter that sort of gave you the particularly strong numbers that will reverse next quarter? \nIvan Seidenberg: I think, as you have seen in our number, our growth was 1.6; subtract from it the 300,000 in the reseller side, but frankly we had a little bit lower growth than what we had anticipated. \n Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs. \n Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple of follow-ups on Rural Cellular and then one on the auction. On Rural Cellular, can you talk about how this impacts dividend timing out of Verizon Wireless? You've talked about 2009 as an estimated timeframe before for implementing the dividend again. Was there an assumption in there for this type of deal? I know there were assumptions built around auctions expanding there, so does this sort of delay the timing beyond 2009?  A second question on Rural Cellular. You are migrating a large amount of GSM subs over to CDMA. We have seen this be problematic before in the industry. What gives you confidence here that this process will be seamless? \nIvan Seidenberg: On the first question is this transaction is not all that gigantic. So I think when you look at the dividends, it will not impact it materially. I think that when we talked this over with Vodafone, they understood that quite correctly. Their assumption on the dividends is, I think the way they look at it has been accurate. I think absent other changes to what we do with Verizon Wireless, they have been anticipating free cash flow opportunities. So I think the way you should think about this, Jason, is that our first goal -- and it always has been -- is to continue to grow both the top line and the bottom line of Verizon Wireless. I think in this case we can deploy capital better by reinvesting in the business than moving toward a quicker dividend. I think the 2009 timing could be impacted, but it is too soon to really determine the exact date of that.  I think on the build what gives us the view of this, I could say this and I will say it very clearly, I don't think that Verizon Wireless misses many operating targets or misses the opportunity to do these integrations. They have done probably 60 or 70 of them over the course of the last four or five years. So I think they will be careful, and they will look at it very carefully. Remember, we're going to do something on a dual basis here. We will continue to run the GSM network so that we can take care of roaming partners, and at the same time, we will have a careful transition of new customers onto the CDMA network. \n Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs : That is great. Just one follow-up question on the auctions related to accepting the new rules last week, can you just sort of walk us through the perspective there? \nIvan Seidenberg: Well, I think there is a couple of things. First of all, there is a block of spectrum is going to be auctioned off. Assuming it looks roughly like the AWS spectrum, there could be four or five licenses per market. We have made our position clear about the FCC not putting any unnecessary restrictions on any of these blocks. What we need to do now is see what the rules say and then develop a bidding strategy accordingly. I think it should be obvious to most people that the reason we're interested in the spectrum is it is attractive spectrum in the right bands and that we have had such extraordinary growth over the last few years that we tend to put the spectrum to use pretty quickly.  So we will just take a wait and see attitude, and I think that we will be in a position to decide how and whether we bid on any portions of any of the licenses that are open, and we will see how this unfolds during the year. \n Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs : Great, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins - Citigroup. \n Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can give us an update on the MCI integration process with respect to how the profit contribution is comparing to your original numbers? Within that context, as the integration continues, is there a point where MCI margins can take a significant step upwards? Thanks. \nDoreen Toben: As far as the original guidance that we gave in synergies, we're actually on target and really ahead of target, so no issue there. We have done extremely well. We are very quick to move all the traffic onto our own network, which gave us an awful lot of the synergies very quickly. We have done a lot of things between the wireline and wireless to give us even more synergies.  What was the second part of your question? \n Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup: As the integration continues, can margins take a step function up at some point from where they are today? \nDoreen Toben: Absolutely. I think what we said coming in was that MCI was at very low margins compared to their peers and we think over the next two and three years their margins will significantly improve. We have talked to you before about the fact that we're investing in what we call our 10-point plan to reduce access costs this year. We are heavily into that. We're doing some trunking and rearrangements in co-location cases, which will give us an opportunity to significantly increase our margin going forward. \n Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch. \n David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch : Denny, you had mentioned some of the productivity and cost reduction initiatives and you continue with some of the organizational alignments, the latest being the CTL. At the corporate level, you have talked about common platform and processes. Can you update us on any initiatives, targets or timeframes related to overall productivity? \nDenny Strigl: We continue to focus on the productivity gains, both in our customers\u2019 premises and in our garages, preparing our installation crews to get out to do the work. We have also in some of our jurisdictions been adding a lower-paid technician. Frankly, we have appointed a new executive this last week. I think you saw the appointment of Dick Lynch. Dick will be focused on all three of our networks, productivity gains and cost efficiencies, and I think you will see further improvement going forward. \n David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch : Any specifics you can give us on some of the initiatives? \nDenny Strigl: Not in this call. \n David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch : Just one last one. Can you update us on the FairPoint process? \nIvan Seidenberg: Yes, I will do that. The FairPoint process has moved along. I think you know we have a shareholders meeting scheduled for August 22 I believe it is, so they have cleared the SEC. We have gotten the documents out. They are going to have a shareholder meeting. There's lots of activity in all three Northern states. To us this is all part of the process, and we will work through all the issues. FairPoint is doing a good job at making its case, and we're doing what we need to do to support them.  So the next step will be shareholder approval, and what we are looking for is almost all of the decisions by the Public Service Commission should be completed late this year. So we are looking for hopefully a late this year, early next year close on this transaction. \n David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch : Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers. \n Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers : Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on wireline margins. Can you tell us where you are at in the process of deploying the $300 million in CapEx related to bringing down access charges? I imagine the strength in enterprise sales, while you're still paying more access than you want, hurts the margin here in the near term. I am wondering if you will give us some sort of timing as to when we will start to see that savings flow through?  A second question, I know it is not this quarter but I think everyone is interested. Can you give us some idea as to porting activity in wireless, whether a certain other carrier perhaps is getting more ports or whether they did for the first two weeks in July and maybe that slowed down? Thanks. \nIvan Seidenberg: Let me begin first, Tom, with your last question. We did see an impact in our porting rates for a short period of time. But in the last week, we returned to a net positive position against all of our competitors. In fact, we are now back to approximately two customers are in for every customer that we lose.  The first part of your question was the $300 million in CapEx? \nDoreen Toben: We are not quite halfway through that program. As you would expect, that is really capital not so much an expense, and it takes some time to capture those savings. So I would say we are very early into getting the benefits in the first half of the year from those. The bigger impact will come in '08. We will start to see some, especially in the fourth quarter, smaller in the third quarter, but the real big impact I would say comes much more in '08. \n Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers : Great, thank you very much. \nRon Lataille: Operator, I would like to now hand the call over to Ivan Seidenberg for some concluding remarks. \nIvan Seidenberg: Thanks, Ron. Just a couple of quick comments. I think when we look at the quarter, we are all very pleased with the fact that we sustained and built on our excellent momentum on the top line. So we have been deploying capital and making investments internally to create the kind of organic momentum that Doreen and Denny talked about here. That has also converted itself into some double-digit EPS growth, which is for us two quarters in a row a good milestone for us.  A lot of questions on this call about margins, so just let me comment from my perspective on this. I think what you are hearing, and all the questions are really very good. Our view on this is that the margin issue will continue to improve. You need to develop momentum on this. I think we have develop momentum on the top line, and I think as we make investments in IT and the network and marketing and improve productivity as Denny said, and start to deal with a lot of the longer-term synergy opportunities from the transaction with MCI, we will see this pick up momentum as we head into late '07 and into '08. But this is an issue of momentum. I think first you get the momentum on the top line, and then I think you will start to see momentum on the margin line. Nevertheless, we still had double-digit earnings growth this quarter, and we're making good progress.  I would also make the comment that we are in a situation where we have the best balance sheet we have ever had in our company. I think that gives us enormous flexibility, particularly in light of all of the recent crunches in the credit markets and all the things that are going on. So this has given us the ability to reduce debt. It has given us the ability to make a couple of transactions here, with CyberTrust and now Rural. So I think that we have the opportunity to acquire strategic assets to sustain both top line and EPS growth.  I think it also gives us a chance -- and Doreen will do this over the course of the next six months -- to think about new ways of improving returns to shareholders, given the place that the company is in. So all of the growth services that we have in wireless, broadband and managed network services in our three units are doing well. In our Verizon services organization, which basically focuses on productivity improvements and management of our infrastructure, they are also gaining momentum as we head into the year.  So we feel very good halfway through the year that we are positioned the way we want to be positioned, and we are very focused on increasing returns to shareholders and driving our stock price to continue to move in the right direction. Thank you. \nRon Lataille: That concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining us."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2007, "date": "2007-04-30 14:26:47", "content": "\nExecutives"}], "2009": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2008, "date": "2009-01-27 15:02:18", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President Investor Relations Ivan Seidenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Denny Strigl - President and Chief Operating Officer Doreen Toben - Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts : Tom Sykes \u2013 Barclays John Hodulik \u2013 UBS Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan David Barden - Banc of America Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Tim Horan - Oppenheimer Chris King \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus Phil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie Research\nOperator: Welcome to the Verizon fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us and I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being web cast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which of course are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. I\u2019d like to very quickly cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.43. Adjusted earnings per share before the effects of special items were $0.61. We are excluding two special items from adjusted results. The first is an after-tax charge of $424 million or $0.15 per share for severance and other related expenses. Included in this charge are pension settlement losses for employees receiving lump sum distributions resulting from our previous separation plan as well as charges associated with additional employee severance in 2009. We are also excluding an after-tax charge of $35 million or $0.01 per share for merger integration costs as well as a charge of $31 million after tax or $0.01 related to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investments in certain marketable securities. With that I will now turn the call over to Ivan for some opening remarks.\nIvan Seidenberg: Thank you Ron and good morning everyone. Before Doreen presents a full financial review of the quarter\u2019s results, Denny and I would like to provide a few opening comments. To state the obvious, 2008 was a difficult economic environment and there was more than the usual uncertainty as we try to plan for 2009. It is pleasing to report however that throughout 2008 we stayed focused on our strategic business model and made progress in delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We were able to grow earnings more than 7%, increase the dividend by 7% and grow free cash flow before dividends by about 14%. We feel confident that we took the right steps during the year to maximize growth and potential returns of the business going forward. For example, we improved our spectrum position with the purchase of nationwide 700 MHz licenses, we acquired the Rural Cellular and Alltel properties and we spun off some wire line properties in northern New England, passed more than 3 million additional phones with fiber, opened 3.3 million homes for sale of our FiOS TV service and expanded FiOS availability in big city markets like New York. We also reached long-term agreements with our labor unions, the CWA and IBEW and very progressively put that issue behind us. As we expanded our worldwide reach, product and service portfolio and customer support capabilities for our large enterprise customers served by Verizon Business. Our strategic investments are driving innovation and allow us to have better products and services and therefore be a very formidable competitor in every market we serve. As a result, we were able to effectively gain share and at the same time grow revenues by 5% and increase ARPU\u2019s, the key metrics for our success. Denny and Doreen will review many of the operating numbers with you but I think the results reflect solid execution by each business unit and in the context of 2009 indicate that we clearly have the potential to continue to perform well both absolutely and relatively in this very challenging market. With that I would like to ask Denny now to provide us with some additional comments on our operational performance.\nDenny Strigl: Thank you Ivan. Good morning everyone. I share Ivan\u2019s confidence. Our business will continue to compete effectively and we think it will do so within any environment. Within each of our businesses that means we must continue to innovate and be leaders in the marketplace and I think we can demonstrate that leadership in each of our strategic areas in 2008 and I\u2019d like to give you some examples. In wireless we launched a total of 36 new devices in 2008, more than 1/3 of which were PDA\u2019s or Smart phones and we already have about two dozen new devices scheduled to launch in the first half of 2009. We were the first to introduce nationwide unlimited plan aimed at the high end of the market and the first to introduce megabit pricing for data usage. Our open development initiative is another platform for innovation and we made solid progress partnering with developers this past year with 29 approved open development devices. We were again recognized by industry organizations and publications in 2008 for providing the highest level of satisfaction and setting the standard for customer service for the wireless industry. Just last week our focus on providing customers with the most reliable network service paid off at the Presidential inauguration when our service held up under the strain of significantly higher than normal usage while others struggled. FiOS was also a market leader in 2008. In terms of speed we expanded our industry leading consumer broadband connection speeds of up to 50MB downstream and 20MB upstream to our entire FiOS footprint. We expanded our high definition offer to include over 100 HD channels. We continued to add features, enhancements and upgrades that no other provider has matched in our home media DVR, interactive media guide, content search and interactive widgets. FiOS has been recognized by various publications and surveys as being a superior, best in class service. In Verizon Business we continued to expand our capabilities as a leading provider of advanced communications and IT solutions to governments and businesses throughout the world. Nearly 70% of our customers have or are in the process of transitioning to private IP services. As in our other businesses, industry experts and partners gave us recognition for our capabilities throughout the year. Although the environment continues to be challenging from both a competitive and economic perspective our strategic focus has not changed. We will continue to focus on growing revenue, taking share and at the same time improving profitability. So from our perspective the fourth quarter demonstrates that our business continues to perform well both operationally and financially. If you look at the fourth quarter in absolute terms or relative to our historic growth it was a good quarter. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth in all strategic areas, over 12% in wireless, nearly 37% in broadband and video and over 8% in the key strategic services offered by Verizon Business. In addition, ARPU grew 1.4% in wireless and over 14% in consumer. Customer growth was also good this quarter. 1.4 million wireless net adds, record net adds for FiOS with over 300,000 new TV subscribers and 282,000 new FiOS internet customers. We also saw some sequential improvement in retail residence primary line losses and DSL. We were also focused on productivity of course and improving productivity throughout 2008. Wireless once again showed improvement in our already industry-leading cash cost for subscriber metrics and we remain the industry leader in margins. In FiOS we reduced install times by 15%. In addition the Telco group reduced force by over 10,000 last year and by the way over 22,000 in the last three years. So as we said in the third quarter, Verizon Business also saw some increasing competitive pricing pressures and some up front costs related to new contract wins that affected our margins. This quarter some volume declines tied to a weakening economy increased the pressures on margins. In summary, we made progress but we can do more and we will stay operationally flexible and look for ways to simplify the business and manage the cost structure for long-term margin improvement. Doreen, I will now turn it over to you for a review of the details of the quarter.\nDoreen Toben: Thanks Denny. Turning to slide five, consolidated revenues grew nearly $1.1 billion or 4.6% in the fourth quarter, finishing the year at $97.1 billion representing top line growth of 5.1% in 2008. Our margins also expanded in the fourth quarter and full year. Operating income grew 6.6% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year with full year margin expansion of 70 basis points. EBITDA grew 5.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year with a 2008 EBITDA margin increasing to 33.5%. Finally, we ended the year with earnings from continuing operations of $2.54 per share, up 7.6%. Turning next to cash flows and the balance sheet we ended the year with $26.6 billion in cash flows from continuing operations. As we expected, total capital spending declined $300 million year-over-year to $17.2 billion. A ratio of CapEx to revenue improved 120 basis points to finish the year at 17.8%. In 2008 we also returned value to share owners paying $5 billion in dividends and repurchasing approximately 1.4 billion of our stock. Our balance sheet metrics remain strong with net debt of $42.2 billion including more than $9 billion in cash held in anticipation of the Alltel closing and net debt to EBITDA of about 1.3 times at the end of 2008. With regard to the financing for the Alltel transaction we used a combination of Verizon Wireless and Alltel cash, proceeds from pre-funding and the $12.35 billion bank ridge loan to fund the acquisition. Looking ahead we anticipate the bridge loan will be paid off with Verizon Wireless free cash flow, proceeds from the required asset divestitures and turn out financing which we estimate will be somewhere between $6-7 billion. Now let\u2019s look at our segments beginning with wireless. Wireless had a strong quarter of high quality retail customer growth capping a year in which we added 5.8 million organic net new retail customers. Excluding divestitures, total net adds for the fourth quarter were 1.4 million, all of these were retail and 93% were post-paid. We divested a net 122,000 customers, primarily rural cellular markets as part of a previously announced exchange agreement with another carrier. We ended the year with a total customer base of 72.1 million, 67 million of which were retail post paid. We have just over 3 million pre-paid customers and only 2 million customers from resellers. Retail gross adds in the fourth quarter were essentially flat both sequentially and year-over-year. On an annual basis retail gross adds were up 3.5%. Churn was up two basis points sequentially and on a year-over-year basis total churn was up 15 basis points to 1.35% and retail post paid churn was up 11 basis points to 1.05%. We also maintained a strong wireless revenue performance delivering double digit revenue growth for the quarter and for the year. Total revenue grew 12.3% in the fourth quarter and 12.4% for the full year. Service revenue grew by 12% on both a quarterly and annual basis. Total service APRU increased 1.4% in the quarter and 1.2% for the full year making this 11 consecutive quarter\u2019s of year-over-year growth in ARPU. As we have seen all year, about 70% of service revenue growth is driven by wireless data. Wireless data represented 26.8% of total service revenue in the fourth quarter. Data revenue is now in excess of $10 billion annually, up 44% in 2008. Total data ARPU in the fourth quarter grew by $3.02 or nearly 28% year-over-year. The main drivers of this growth continue to be broadband access and usage, email and messaging. Revenue from non-messaging data services represents more than half of the total wireless data revenue. Non-messaging data revenues grew 2% in the fourth quarter and 53% for the year. The fact is, we are still in the early stages of non-messaging services with relatively modest adoption rates so far so we continue to see plenty of upside potential as we further penetrate the customer base and as the proliferation of new devices stimulates demand for more and more wireless data usage. Smart phone sales continue to accelerate representing more than 37% of the retail devices sold in the fourth quarter up from 30% last quarter. Obviously we expect that the ARPU, particularly the data component, will be significantly higher from these devices. With our enhanced spectrum position, 4G plans with LTE and our open development initiatives we are well positioned to compete for future wireless data growth. As it is today, our focus will be on driving revenue growth, increasing ARPU and generating cash flow. We also enhanced our growth opportunities through the acquisition of Alltel. This acquisition has many compelling, long-term strategic benefits. It expands our network to cover nearly the entire United States population, improves our revenue mix by increasing the wireless portion to about 55% of total Verizon and makes us the largest U.S. carrier in terms of total customers which will be in excess of 80 million following the required divestitures. In addition, the Alltel merger also provides us with significant synergy opportunities. To refresh your memory, we identified saving opportunities with a net present value in excess of $9 billion. Our estimate for cost synergies both capital and expense as well as the estimates for integration costs to achieve those synergies are unchanged from our announcement last June. Having just closed the transaction we are still reviewing the Alltel financials to determine our opening balance sheet. Higher than expected financing and interest costs will impact earnings accretion in the short-term however this is clearly a value creating transaction. To summarize, Verizon wireless continues to demonstrate success in achieving both strong growth and profitability. Chart ten displays an impressive list of metrics for 2008. Our continued focus on increasing retail market share, retaining customers and improving operational efficiency has resulted in sustained double-digit revenue growth, increasing ARPU, industry leading margins and substantial cash flow. The EBITDA margin on service revenue was 37.2% in the fourth quarter and 45.5% for the full year. We have some favorable impact in the fourth quarter which resulted in higher profitability than normal. Absent these items the fourth quarter and full-year margin would have been in the 45%+ range. Going forward you should continue to expect us to maintain EBITDA margins within the previously stated range of 43-45%. Wireless capital spending for the year was $6.5 billion and the CapEx to ratio revenue was 13.2% at year end, an annual improvement of 160 basis points. Let\u2019s next move to wire line, starting with the consumer market. Our FiOS results this quarter demonstrate the power of our triple play offer and show the resilience of our value proposition even in a slowing economy. We had our best FiOS quarter ever with record net adds for both TV and internet. While we remain pleased with our progress in New York City I will once again say it was only one factor in a strong result across the board. During the fourth quarter we added 303,000 new FiOS TV customers, ending the year with just over 1.9 million subscribers and a penetration rate of 21%. During 2008 we more than doubled our TV subscriber base, adding 975,000 customers and increased our penetration by roughly 500 basis points. At the same time we also significantly expanded the availability of the FiOS triple play, ending 2008 with 9.2 million homes open for sale for FiOS TV and a 57% increase in market availability in just one year. More than 2.2 million of these homes opened for sale in the third and fourth quarters and earlier this month we passed the one million mark for premises open for sale in the multi dwelling unit or MDU category. So we are clearly building momentum and gaining critical mass. As we have previously said, there is a strong correlation between homes open for sale and customer growth in subsequent quarters. On the broadband side, we added 214,000 net new subscribers in the fourth quarter, a 66% sequential improvement. We added a record number of new FiOS internet customers with 282,000 and we saw some sequential improvement in DSL. We ended 2008 with 2.5 million FiOS internet subscribers adding 956,000 customers during the year for an increase of 63%. We also saw our penetration rate increase by about 400 basis points to 25%. From a FiOS deployment perspective, we have passed 12.7 million homes as of the end of 2008 so we are a bit ahead of our planned roll out schedule of 3 million homes per year. Fiber to the home now passes about 40% of the total households in our landline footprint and 93% of the 10 million FiOS data homes open for sale can purchase the triple play, up from 80% a year ago. We will continue to expand FiOS triple play availability as we further expand existing markets and enter new urban markets later this year. On the traditional access line side of the business we saw some sequential improvement in retail residential primary lines which were down 460,000. Total switched access lines declined by 911,000. We continue to see an increasing correlation between our triple play availability and line retention. In the past, we have referenced an average improvement in line retention of about 250 basis points when we look at video markets open for sale for more than six months compared with markets with no fiber to the home. By the end of the year we were tracking average improvements of about 400 basis points. As FiOS continues to scale and we extend triple play coverage we are optimistic that this correlation will strengthen and we see a more meaningful improvement in overall line loss trends. FiOS remains at the center of our consumer strategy as our broadband and video services continue to drive consumer revenue growth. Legacy consumer revenues grew by 2.9% in the fourth quarter and were up 1.7% for the full year. Broadband and video revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 42% and totaled more than $4.2 billion for the full year. We are also seeing consistently strong growth in consumer retail ARPU which increased 14.3% from fourth quarter a year ago. About 80% of this increase is attributable to new services we have introduced within the past few years. Our overall FiOS ARPU continues to grow and now stands over $133 per month. The FiOS triple play ARPU is even higher. Now let\u2019s take a look at Verizon Business. Total revenues in the fourth quarter declined $124 million or 2.3% year-over-year. We are starting to see some revenue softness that we believe is cyclical and economy related due to a combination of delayed decision making on the part of the CIO\u2019s and lower volumes tied to rising unemployment. With the strengthening of the dollar the negative FX impact this quarter was also significant. As we said all along, there continues to be a shift within enterprise customer spending towards strategic services like private IP, managed services and security. Our strategic services now comprise 30% of the total Verizon Business revenues. Revenue from these services continues to grow up 8.4% in the quarter. Looking ahead you can expect us to continue to be disciplined and balance new sales and profitability and we are focused on increasing the range of our professional consulting services and improving our competitive position in this area. In summarizing wire line I would emphasize that we made good progress in improving our revenue mix and competitive positioning. Broadband and video services now comprise more than 31% of legacy consumer revenue. FiOS is on plan both financially and operationally and will continue to provide us great opportunity to drive customer growth and revenue growth. We are also very focused on continuing to improve capital and operational efficiency. In Verizon Business the continued shift to services like private IP resulted in strategic services revenue growth in excess of 16% in 2008. So we are well positioned to compete in all the strategic growth areas of the company. As you can see, wire line EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter fell below the 27% we experienced in the first three quarters. There were several reasons for this. First, pressure in Verizon Business as significant increases in non-farm unemployment late in the fourth quarter resulted in volume declines in higher margin services as well as lower volumes for small business customers. In addition there were some timing issues related to force reductions and organizational realignments as well as increases in bad debt, marketing and some information system contracts. To wrap up, from a financial perspective in 2008 we were able to continue growing revenues in the mid single digits, deliver bottom line earnings growth, generate solid cash flow growth and return value to share owners through dividend and share repurchases. We were able to arrange the necessary financing to fund the $28 billion acquisition of Alltel. All things considered, solid performance. Our balance sheet is healthy and we are in a strong financial position. Our investments are clearly paying off, driving volumes and revenues in our key strategic areas and the capital efficiency of the business continues to improve. In terms of net pension and other post-retirement benefits expense, we are estimating an incremental negative impact on earnings per share of between $0.09 and $0.11 in 2009. From a funding perspective, we estimate a $300 million funding requirement in 2009 for our qualified pension trust which is slightly less than last year. For 2009 we are targeting capital spending excluding amounts related to the Alltel acquisition to be less than the 2008 total of $17.2 billion. We have indicated that as a precautionary measure we intend to start out the year at a lower annual run rate and ramp up as we move through the year as appropriate. We expect that our ratio of CapEx to revenue will continue to improve. Finally, we have confidence in our ability to generate cash, invest for growth and return value to share owners. With that I will turn it back to you Ron.\nRon Lataille: Thank you Doreen. Stacy, Ivan, Denny and Doreen are now available to take questions.\n :\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Tom Sykes \u2013 Barclays.\nTom Sykes \u2013 Barclays: Can you describe the economic forecast that underpins your view you will be able to grow earnings this year? I think you previously said that. Are you assuming current trends will hold throughout the year or does growing earnings require some improvement in the economy? Then, secondly we are just through the election. Can you give us some early insight into whether or not you think the more radical net neutrality proposals might start popping up?\nIvan Seidenberg: I don\u2019t think we have any magic economic forecast that we have looked at. Here is the theory of the case. When we look at 2008 our view is we stayed focused on our strategic innovation, capital investments and the execution on the part of Denny and his team. We obviously layer in things like the Alltel transaction and our view is, as I said earlier, we have the potential to continue to perform well absolutely and relatively. I don\u2019t think we have any specific forecast. I think Doreen will reaffirm this but the idea is visibility in 2009 is less clear than it has been in other years but the pieces here for us it is clear to focus on out performing our competitors in the market and doing more relatively. On the election, I think the new administration is very responsive. They have been reaching out. There is lots of dialogue. I think they recognize the most important issues they have right now are to focus on the balance in the stimulus package between tax benefits versus grant approaches to things. Stimulus spending versus tax. There are lots of meetings going on. The business roundtable is focused on this issue. We have been working with the administration. Net neutrality I haven\u2019t had anybody ask me that in the last couple of weeks. I am sure it is out there some place but even some of the players in net neutrality have already modified their position on it. I don\u2019t view that as an issue that will sort of dominate the headlines for awhile.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik \u2013 UBS.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: If we could talk about margins real quick both on the wireless and wire line side. On the wireless side obviously above the long-term corporate guidance. Could you just talk about some of the drivers there and then as we look out into how the competitive environment keeps evolving is that sort of what we can expect going forward? On the wire line side obviously very different than your sort of longer term guidance. Is this the sort of level or in this range of what we could expect while the economy remains weak? It sounds like a lot of the drivers you talked about in the prepared remarks were really driven by the economy. Obviously it could be some time before things improve plus this sector is generally thought of as something of a lagging indicator. Is this sort of the right level for going forward in 2009?\nDoreen Toben: I\u2019ll start with the wire line and wireless margins. I think as I said every time I meet with investors there can always be a quarter that can bump up over the 43-45%. Clearly if you wanted to miss you want to miss on the upside. This quarter there were some one-times having to do with vendor credits, some other systems pieces so I would look at this as more of a one-time and we will go back to the 43-45%. Nothing earth shattering that happened. A lot of moving pieces this particular quarter.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Can you maybe quantify for that or is it just a lot of little this and that\u2019s you don\u2019t want to break down?\nDoreen Toben: Nothing was significant. I\u2019m not going to give you the vendor credit number because that is not something we disclose but it was more significant than it typically is in the Q and the rest were this and that\u2019s that added up to a number that bumped over the 45%.\nDenny Strigl: On the wire line margin, I would make several comments on this. First of all FiOS is on plan and helping. EBITDA positive for the full year 2008. As we look at FiOS the strategic transformation has gone very well for us and of course there is always a lag in the margin when you go through a transformation like we have on FiOS. FiOS productivity is improving. On the line loss side as you have heard there is no change there. We continue to reduce force in areas that are not growing and we are in the process of consolidating our wire line, telecom and business network organization. We expect that will generate some efficiency and productivity improvements in the network planning area, engineering, the maintenance functions and we have a number of ongoing initiatives in the areas of customer self-service, process automation, flow through, back office productivity and so forth. Longer term, our guidance on wire line margins really hasn\u2019t changed.\nDoreen Toben: One additional comment I would add is I did give the guidance of pension and [OPEB] between $0.09 and $0.11. You should think of that as almost exclusively as wire line which will hit obviously in 2009. So that will certainly be an impact for next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan.\nMike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan: On the wireless side can you just give us a little more data? You talked about non-messaging data revenue being an opportunity but maybe comments on the impact of the economy, headcount reductions, the use of BlackBerry and also the air card business and secondly on the enterprise side can you just give us some sense of the impact of FX on the international side? It certainly looked like it rolled over pretty hard on growth rates.\nDoreen Toben: I\u2019ll start on the FX and Denny do you want to go? The impact was the largest impact that we have seen ever to the tune of $110-120 million sequentially. We have a very sizeable international portfolio so it was in fact a very big number sequentially.\nDenny Strigl: On the wireless question I guess the underlying question is there a slow down in wireless or what has changed in wireless. I think you need to look at a number of factors. Service revenue grew 12%. ARPU increased 1.4%. Data revenues for us continued to grow, about 41% as Doreen had said, and non-messaging revenue increased 52%. We are selling more Smart phones as Doreen mentioned in her comments, about 37% of the retail devices that have been sold. We are increasing our focus on the business segment where we have relatively lower share. Our growth drivers are clearly performing for us. We are first to report but I don\u2019t think we lost share this quarter. Our reporting ratio actually improved. We have no evidence of slowing or customers trading down either on plans or features. Our churn did tick up a bit compared to the prior year, I think you saw about 11 basis points increase on post paid churn. I can give you specifically where we see most of that. About 5 basis points from excess cards. That probably reflects the employment issue and the layoffs in many businesses. About 4 basis points on third and fourth line disconnects. We see no reporting evidence that they are going to other providers. I think that is economy related. I would just conclude that I think we are well positioned to compete and I think we will continue to have strong performance in our wireless company.\nMike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan: As you look into 2009 with the boost of [metro] entering your markets is there anything you guys are going to do differently?\nDenny Strigl: No. We are going to do nothing differently. This always comes up two or three times a year. If you look at Sprint, Boost, Leap, Metro I think as you know that is not our primary focus. Our primary focus is on the retail post pay market. That is not something that we are going after strongly and I don\u2019t see it having any impact or at least a negligible impact to date. I don\u2019t think there is any need for us to respond.\nMike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan: Do you feel the same way on the wire line business from a replacement standpoint?\nDenny Strigl: Yes. We do.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden - Banc of America.\nDavid Barden - Banc of America: Number one, if you could just share how the Qwest relationship impacted net adds reporting in the quarter. Obviously we were expecting you guys to see an acceleration in that bringing add over to your base over the course of the year. Second, maybe Doreen on enterprise obviously incremental to the currencies can you talk a little bit about the financial sector and some of the consolidation we are seeing there and what kind of impact that might have incremental to the stand alone currency impacts we saw year-to-date?\nDenny Strigl: Let me start with your question and frankly I don\u2019t have much to tell you there. Qwest started selling Verizon Wireless service to new customers in the fourth quarter. These are Verizon customers. It is not, I think as you know, a reseller agreement. Notification of Qwest\u2019s Spring customers will occur starting this quarter so no specifics to give you but we expect Qwest to be overall a very good distribution partner.\nDoreen Toben: I think we saw an impact in both the financial and retail sectors in particular in LD minutes after we started to see in November and December unemployment and the job losses is where we really saw it kick in. Verizon Business is probably the hardest visibility for next year. You saw all the job announcements yesterday so trying to determine what impact that is going to have on the different sectors has been difficult. The one thing is the financial and retail is the biggest changes in to date.\nDavid Barden - Banc of America: Doreen, just on CapEx you have been talking about slowing it up a little bit at the beginning of the year and trying to come in lower than last year. Is this more of a containing wire line to right size the business? Is this maybe holding off on LTE deployments to see how the year unfolds? Where are the savings going to be emerging in this business?\nDoreen Toben: I would say it is not a containment. It is really to start out slow, see what we need to do so we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves in putting in capacity that we don\u2019t need.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Denny I wonder if you could expand a bit on the open development initiative. You talked about 29 devices approved. Are we going to see those coming on line in the next month or two or is that somewhat longer term? Also, on the LTE if you could just update us on the timeline of what we might see in the remainder of 2009 and into 2010?\nDenny Strigl: We are planning on the LTE piece to do our market trials later this year. So they are scheduled for 2009. We are working with our manufacturers. Very good cooperation in that regard. Commercial availability in 2010. Our goal is within the first half of 2010. On the ODI, those devices will come on line as we roll out our LTE initiatives so in conjunction with that. The 29 devices some of them are actually ready to go on our existing 3G network. I think it is positioned very well. Obviously machine to machine is the focus of our ODI and I think we have a good start in that regard.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: A delay on the digital TV shouldn\u2019t cause problems there?\nDenny Strigl: No it shouldn\u2019t. We are trying to work through that issue but certainly later in the year had been our plan on the trials and we are trying to work through even with the DTV delay whether we could use some of that spectrum to work out the trial.\nIvan Seidenberg: Concerning the bill as we understand it, it allows certain programmers to cut over sooner if they are ready and it gives us a chance to use that spectrum where it is available for testing and to move forward. I think the way the bill is currently constructed the potential for further delay beyond the June 12 date is probably pretty low.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research: A follow-up on the wireless side, as growth in the industry slows and potentially more of the growth comes from data and upselling customers, why wouldn\u2019t margins improve above the guidance that you have had of 43-45% over time just as that marketing can be scaled across slower adds but better revenue from existing users?\nDoreen Toben: This is sort of the age-old question and it is the same answer. We continue to balance growth and margins. So we want to make sure as the growth is available to us we don\u2019t slow down the growth enough to impact the margins. So it is really a growth in margin and we just see that as continuing to see the right balance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: First, one more on the wireless margin outlook maybe from a different angle. 43-45% range that we have talked about, the Alltel deal synergy targets get you somewhere in the range of 150-200 basis points of margin enhancement. I guess the question is what keeps us at the 43-45% in the context of the Alltel enhancement because what it implies if you stay there is that you intend to reinvest those synergies back into the business. Then, the second question on enterprise, you have obviously flagged the pricing pressure, there is the FX headwinds. Denny you mentioned volumes slowing down. Can you give us the outlook for this business? A lot of us look at a framework of the last cycle where enterprise was down double digits. Can you just help us think through that?\nDoreen Toben: I guess if I start on the Alltel, I don\u2019t know that I agree that is should kick us up above 45%. There clearly is reinvestment that we are doing. If you think about the handsets that need to be replaced for Alltel to enable us to get more data revenue growth that is probably a short-term piece. I still think 43-45% is alright and will not bump us up above that on an ongoing basis.\nDenny Strigl: On the enterprise side, let me cover just a number of things that hopefully will help here. We did see of course specifically weakness in financial services and in the retail sectors. I think we are seeing a correlation between the significant force reductions. Certainly Doreen had mentioned this and the force reductions are causing lower volumes. LD usage dropped from quarter to quarter and was at the lowest level in at least two years. We expect the layoffs and consolidations will probably continue to have an impact through 2009. Certainly as Doreen indicated the announcements you heard yesterday will have an impact. For our part though we are still focused on driving growth where we can and we are enhancing our long-term growth opportunities. Long-term enterprise customers we think will seek more bandwidth capabilities, add new applications, buy our managed services and we are well positioned to deliver in all of those areas. Of course we continue to manage the cost side of the business. I might mention here too that we continue to look for ways to partner and you will soon see a formal press release that Verizon and Accenture have reached agreement on a strategic partnership that leverages our complementary assets and capabilities. We will do joint marketing sales initiatives which will be launched first in the United States and then will extend globally as opportunities arise. Again, you can expect to see a formal press release in that regard shortly.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Denny, on the enterprise side as you think about how we could bottom out this cycle how we bottomed out last cycle, people think the positive is that you have a lot more pricing discipline this cycle than the last cycle. The negative is this cycle is a heck of a lot more broad based across enterprise. If you look at a framework of down high singles, low double digits is it better or worse this time?\nIvan Seidenberg: I think we all have opinions but let me just make a couple of points. First of all we have a much better industry structure than we did the last time so we are more consolidated. We are more focused. We have better products. I think we have much better products to sell into the market once the market starts to pick up. My guess is there are some positives there. You are correct, it is broader, so you have some issues on that side but this is where I think Denny has talked about productivity and costs and building partnerships. So net to me the industry is healthier this time around so I think we should bottom out differently and we should see the upside in a much better way.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: Back to the enterprise front again. Can you talk about maybe what percentage of revenues are more usage base correlated there? Secondly, maybe where you think some of the pricing pressure is coming from because clearly the industry structure is a lot better than we saw last time.\nDoreen Toben: The biggest usage base is LD and I don\u2019t have at the tip of my tongue what percentage of it is really LD to be honest. Ron has it here. He thinks it is about 20-25% so that would be the usage piece. The second part of your question?\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: What do you think the pricing competition is coming from? Is it driven by customers? Because it doesn\u2019t seem like you have an awful lot of competitors right now.\nDenny Strigl: It is driven by contract renewals. So every time we see a customer, a 3 year or 4 year contract expiring, there is various competition and essentially that is where you see it. It is price take downs on renewals.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: Doreen, as you do all your puts and takes it looks like your mass market revenue should turn positive here in 2009. Do you think that [access] have peaked or how are you feeling about those trends in overall mass markets if not maybe this year when do you think that turns positive?\nDoreen Toben : The consumer revenue is positive this quarter, right so if you take out when we have mass market we have if you will the old MCI long distance which is national so you have already seen consumer be positive this quarter. Obviously FiOS just gets better from here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris King \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.\nChris King \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : First of all I was wondering if you had any broad commentary on the various stimulus proposals that have been flying around Washington over the course of the last couple of weeks and what you are looking for or what you would not like to see in any of those plans. Secondly, I was wondering you guys are evidently selling a Femtocell now over the course of the last couple of days. It really is just kind of a signal enhancer it appears at this point. Any kind of longer term plans for that product offering?\nDenny Strigl: I\u2019ll take the stimulus issue. I think we are part of the process. We appreciate to give you sort of a benchmark. What we like are things like depreciation and tax policy. What we probably don\u2019t like are grants that have a lot of government conditions on them. So given those two benchmarks so far the dialogue has been pretty good and we will continue to comment on that. I think as you look at our company we have made a lot of investments in broadband and what we don\u2019t want to see is additional government regulation on any new broadband that would have any sort of backward looking impact on the company. Femtocell, as you know, is the secret weapon of the century. So you will I\u2019m sure after one day of sales we can tell you it is the next millennium secret weapon.\nIvan Seidenberg: I do think it has opened some good opportunity for us. For those of you that haven\u2019t followed this closely yet it is a signal enhancing device for both homes and businesses where we have weak signal. We just see a good opportunity here particularly as more and more customers begin to use broadband applications in the home and in business and want to be portable with those devices. Nothing specific to tell you at this point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie Research.\nPhil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie Research : Working capital management was really good in this quarter and in particular inventories were down 16% sequentially which isn\u2019t what typically happens. Can you talk about if that was an effort by you and if you expect that to go down further going forward or how are you think about it?\nDoreen Toben: I think one of the biggest changes we had in the quarter was set top boxes and it was a concerted effort on our part to manage that process better. That was really the biggest change to tell you the truth and we are very focused on set top box management going forward. Also to some extent handsets. We had some handsets in the third quarter that we needed to work on and move those through which we did. Those are the two biggest changes that we will continue to work on all through 2009.\nPhil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie Research : Do you expect that inventory to come down further going forward?\nDoreen Toben: The absolute inventory number in the balance sheet I\u2019m not sure. Do I expect the inventory in the set top boxes to come down? Yes.\nRon Lataille: I\u2019d like to now turn the call back over to Ivan for some concluding remarks.\nIvan Seidenberg: Thank you Ron. Thank you all. We are exhausted from all these questions here. We appreciate all your interest and your interest in probing the business. Just a couple of comments. We think we had a very solid quarter. We had an excellent year and we think we have built solid momentum as we head into 2009. Hopefully you think of us in 2009 as having built a solid foundation on execution, great financial discipline and innovation. We see no reason why the momentum we have developed in terms of our progress in the marketplace should not continue in some way. Like all of you we don\u2019t have perfect visibility into the economy so the level of success we have will be tempered somewhat by what the economy gives us. At this point our view is that we will continue to perform well absolutely and perform well relatively. We are looking to continue to be a formidable player in the markets we serve. As the year unfolds we will obviously have more insights to our view as we start to build a track record in 2009.\nRon Lataille: That concludes our call today. Once again I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us and we will see you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect at this time. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-10-27 15:14:13", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President Investor Relations Ivan Seidenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Denny Strigl - President and Chief Operating Officer Doreen Toben - Chief Financial Officer \nAnalysts: John Hodulik \u2013 UBS Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup David Barden - Banc of America Tom Sykes \u2013 Barclays Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse Tim Horan - Oppenheimer Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: Welcome to our Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us and I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication, and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.  A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.  I\u2019d like to very quickly cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings for the third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.59, adjusted earnings per share before the effects of special items was $0.66. We are excluding two special items from adjusted results. The first is a charge of $164 million after tax or $0.06 per share for severance and other related expenses. Included in this charge are costs recognized as the result of work force reductions that are currently underway. The charges associated with the reduction are approximately 2,700 employees. We are also excluding a charge of $32 million after tax charge or $0.01 per share for merger integration costs. With that I will now turn the call over to Ivan for some introductory remarks.\nIvan Seidenberg: In light of the extraordinary events and a lot of the market uncertainty we all face we\u2019d like to briefly change the format of our call this morning. Denny and I would like to provide a few opening comments and then of course Doreen will present a full financial review of the quarters results. To start I\u2019d like to say that we are all very pleased with our third quarter results. Base demand and interest in our products and services remain very strong. We were able to meet competitive challenges head on without deviating from our strategic business model and make progress in delivering value to shareowners. We also learned quite a bit during the quarter to help sharpen our focus even further. Denny, in just a moment will provide some key insights to give you some sense of some of the operating lessons that we learned during the quarter. Going forward here a very key question for us is whether in light of all this market turmoil customer spending will continue at the same rate into the fourth quarter and even into 2009. For the past couple of months all of us here have been talking to our partners, our vendors and surveying our customers to see what we might expect for the rest of the year. Based on these reviews and monitoring reports from companies that already reported earnings, the general consensus is that for the Christmas season consumer spending is likely to be lighter and business spending will be somewhat curtailed until next year. We also believe that based on our results this quarter that you can see our business has shown remarkable stability and strength. Since we are about three quarters of the way through the year, 75% actually, we can offer some outlook for the rest of 2008. We expect for the full year 2008 our earnings per share will be somewhere around the 8% level which is consistent with the targets we actually set for ourselves at the beginning of this year with our Board. It\u2019s also consistent with the fact that we raised our dividend recently to 7% starting on November 1st. We consider the combination of an 8% full year 2008 along with the 7% increase in dividend as a good result for the year in light of this economy. As to 2009 we\u2019re all working very hard to figure out what the glide pass will be for customer spending and capital investments on the part of our customers and so on and so forth. We\u2019ll continue to work on this during the months of November and December and in January when we report our fourth quarter we\u2019ll try to give you some outlook as to how we expect the broader economy to affect the company. Most important thing though is we believe our business has the underlying strength to continue making progress along the lines of our three key business units. During the third quarter we also made excellent progress in securing approvals for the Alltel transaction. This transaction is pending a decision before the FCC in just a few days. Just to review the state of play, as of now we have been asked to divest about 105 markets or roughly 2.3 million of the subscriber base of Alltel. This is within the range of expected divestitures. I would also point out that during the pendency of this transaction; while it\u2019s being approved the Alltel base has also grown a little bit since the beginning of the signing of the definitive agreement. As most of you are well aware and based on the early questions you\u2019ve given us, as in any deal there are many last chapter issues that are being worked right now. Obviously financing costs for the deal will be somewhat higher than we thought and there are a few regulatory issues under consideration by the FCC as we speak. In our view absent a surprise or an unexpected condition we still view this deal as very compelling and we believe it will be accretive in year one and we are very focused on trying to complete this transaction as soon as approvals are done. I would remind everyone that even after the FCC action there are notice periods and court actions required before final approvals are really secured. As most of you know, once that happens there is a 120 period in which we are required to close the deal. This will give us the flexibility and time to work through all of the issues to close. Our goal of course is to close the deal as soon as we can. Now I\u2019d like to ask Denny to provide all of us with some additional insights on our operational performance this quarter.\nDenny Strigl: Before Doreen gets into the details of the quarter I\u2019d like to give you some perspective on our performance. In Wireless I believe our business model has not been challenged. We continue to successfully deliver both growth and profitability. There was clearly tough competition in Wireless this quarter but despite this competition our network, our broad based portfolio of devices are strong distribution channels and award winning customer satisfaction helped us to add 1.5 million new customers this quarter and at the same time deliver an industry leading margin of 44.2%. Doreen will review the specifics on revenue growth, ARPU and churn but the bottom line is that Verizon Wireless had another strong quarter and I continue to see Wireless delivering double digit revenue growth and strong margins in the 43% to 45% range. In Telco FiOS continues to show good subscriber growth, deeper penetration and growing ARPU\u2019s.  Over the last year we have more than doubled video subscribers to 1.6 million and increased penetration about 500 basis points. We increased video net ads to 233,000 this quarter and opened 1.2 million additional homes for sale in the quarter which of course will help growth in the fourth quarter. Despite the rhetoric of the cable companies and their advocates FiOS is a growing formidable competitor. For example, in just the first three months FiOS TV has achieved a 10% penetration in Staten Island here in New York City. On average FiOS TV achieves 17% penetration in just 12 months and over 26% penetration within two years. These numbers are better than we had anticipated. The next couple of months we will be two thirds through our fiber build out and FiOS is on plan both operationally and financially. We will continue to see a shift of access lines they\u2019ll go primarily to Wireless but FiOS is scaling and clearly helping to grow consumer ARPU and helping margins. FiOS feature enhancements should also provide further ARPU growth so this has been our strategy and we continue to see up side potential for FiOS. The global enterprise market remains very competitive. Demand for IP and managed services are the key drivers here as we continue to transform our product mix. Our strategic services portfolio is a good indicator of this transition and these services grew over 15% this quarter and now account for 29% of total Verizon Business revenues. CIO\u2019s remain heavily reliant on the RFP process and we\u2019ve seen some aggressive competition in pricing and bidding for long term contracts. We\u2019ve had our share of wins and of course we have been disciplined in our pricing. We\u2019re looking to balance new business growth and margins. Although sales funnels are strong we realize the consolidation in the financial services sector and in uncertain economic environment will likely have an impact in the short term. Longer term the goal is to grow Verizon Business at GDP plus levels and we\u2019re changing the product mix and developing the capabilities to deliver this level of growth in the future as enterprise customers seek more bandwidth capabilities, add new applications, and buy managed services. Finally, overall we\u2019ve maintained our operating flexibility seizing on a number of opportunities to reduce costs through organizational efficiencies and process improvements. Fiber for example continues for us to show great promise for lowering our operating costs. From my perspective, the key strategic areas of the business Wireless, FiOS and strategic business products are all performing well. We continue to try to balance these growth areas, losses in the traditional access lines and profitability. Our diversified portfolio will help us through any economic slow down but we will monitor volumes and remain operationally flexible. Doreen I\u2019ll turn it over to you now and Doreen will review the details of the quarter.\nDoreen Toben: Let\u2019s start with some of the key highlights for the quarter. Consolidated revenues grew $1.3 billion or 5.4%. Verizon Wireless had another excellent quarter with double digit revenue growth of 12.5% very solid customer growth with 1.5 million retail net adds excluding acquisitions and sustained strong profitability with an EBITDA margin on service revenues of 44.2%. We posted improved FiOS numbers this quarter with 233,000 new TV subscribers and 225,000 new internet customers. The continued penetration of FiOS drove nearly 40% growth in total broadband and video revenues this quarter. Within Verizon Business strategic services revenues continued to grow up more than 5% sequentially and 15% year over year. We continue to be very disciplined and focused in our capital spending. We\u2019re on track to deliver a lower overall spend than 2007, even after taking into account about $200 million of integration capital related to rural cellular. As a result, our CapEx to revenue ratio has improved 120 basis points year to date and cash flows from operations less CapEx is significantly higher than a year ago. Our $0.66 of diluted EPS from continuing operations this quarter brings us to $1.93 year to date up 10.3% over last year. Let\u2019s talk about the quarter in more detail. As you can see on slide four our top line grew nearly $1.3 billion or 5.4% this quarter on a year over year basis and is up 5.3% through nine months. Operating income this quarter grew 5.3% and is up 10.1% year to date. Our year to date operating income margin grew 80 basis points to 18.6%. Consolidated EBITDA is up $1.5 billion or 6.5% year to date and our year to date EBITDA margin has expanded to 33.5%. On the next slide you can see our strong cash generation profile. For the first nine months of this year cash flow from continuing operations was about $19.1 billion up 5.9% compared with last year. Our revenue growth and lower capital spending are improving the capital intensity of the business. On a year to date basis total CapEx was $12.6 billion which is around $200 million less than we spent this time last year. Our CapEx to revenue for the nine months was 17.4% an improvement of 120 basis points compared with the year ago. Our balance sheet metrics remain strong with net debt of $44 billion and net debt to EBITDA of less than 1.4 times. I would also add that we have not experienced a significant impact on our overall borrowing from the recent spike in short term interest rates. At the end of the third quarter more than two thirds of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate debt. As a result the rate of interest that we pay on our debt was not significantly affected by recent fluctuations in interest rates. Also access to Commercial Paper markets has not been an issue for us although for a brief period we did pay higher interest rates than we have paid under normal market conditions. However, we\u2019re not talking about anything of significance here. Our Commercial Paper balance at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion about the same place we were at the end of June. In addition, on September 30th we closed on a $4.4 billion three year term loan for Verizon Wireless that refinanced the majority of the 364 day credit facility that we entered into in June to purchase Alltel debt at a discount and to fund our acquisition of Rural Cellular. Let\u2019s now turn our attention to the segment results beginning with Verizon Wireless on slide six. We had another strong quarter of high quality retail customer growth. Excluding acquisitions total net adds for the quarter were 1.5 million all of which were retail and essentially all post paid. We also added about 650,000 customers to our base through our acquisition of Rural Cellular. Our total customer base is 70.8 million; 68.8 million are retail and largely post paid with just under three million pre-paid customers and only two million customers from re-sellers. Gross adds in the quarter were strong up 5.8% compared with a year ago. We continue to lead the industry in customer loyalty. Total churn of 1.33% was up six basis points year over year and retail post paid churn of 1.03% was up seven basis points from a year ago quarter. Turning to revenues, Wireless turned in another strong performance once again delivering double digit growth. Service revenue grew to $10.9 billion this quarter up 12.2% year over year and 4.2% sequentially. Total service ARPU increased 0.9% to $52.18. Similar to last quarter 70% of the growth in total service revenue is from Wireless data. Data now represents 25.5% of total service revenue. The main drivers of growth continue to be broadband access and usage, email and messaging. Data revenues in the quarter grew 42.5% year over year. Data ARPU was up 28.3% over last year. About two thirds of this growth is from non-messaging services. Mobile broadband access through PC cards and email through SmartPhones are experiencing very high growth. SmartPhones represented about 30% of the retail devices sold in the quarter. There\u2019s plenty of momentum and upside here to increase penetration. We have some exciting new devices coming this quarter including the much anticipated Blackberry Storm which has received a number of very positive reviews. As we said before future growth opportunities will be driven our enhanced spectrum position. Our 4G plans with LCE and the innovation we expect to see with our open development initiative. These opportunities position us well for future Wireless growth model which we believe will be driven by the number of connections and total revenues. To summarize Wireless, we had another strong quarter of results across the board with solid customer and revenue growth coupled with strong profitability in a very competitive environment. Our focus on increasing our retail market share customer retention and improving operational efficiency has resulted in sustained growth, industry leading margins and substantial cash flow. EBITDA this quarter grew 11% year over year and is up more than 12% year to date. Our EBITDA margin on service revenue was 44.2% this quarter and 44.9% year to date. Year to date Wireless capital spending totaled $4.7 billion. The CapEx to revenue ratio for the year is 12.9% an improvement of 220 basis points from a year ago. Lastly, Verizon Wireless has won more top honors than any other carrier in the four JD Power customer satisfaction surveys released since August. These studies looked at retail sales and customer care nationally and overall customer satisfaction and call quality by region. Let\u2019s next move to Wireline starting with the consumer market. Our FiOS triple play continues to be a powerful offer and remains at the center of our consumer strategy. In the third quarter we entered a number of new video markets including New York City and began marketing to an additional 1.2 million homes. We are quite pleased with our early progress in New York City although I would say that it was only one factor in the strong results across the board. The sharp increase in homes opened for sale this quarter bodes well for customer growth in subsequent quarters. We added 233,000 new FiOS TV customers this quarter. So far this year we have added over 670,000 new TV subscribers, expanded market availability by nearly 40% and increased penetration by almost 400 basis points to 20%. We are also continuing to add features, enhancements and upgrades that no other provider can match. For example, we\u2019ve expanded the multi-room features of our home media DVR to include HD content. Now customers can view a recorded HD program on other TV sets in the home provided they have an HD set top box. Customers can instantly upgrade to premium content channels straight from an on demand menu using the remote control. We\u2019ve introduced new channel sorting options in a way for me feature which allows customers to pause live programming, change channels and then return to the paused program and pick up watching right where they left off.  There\u2019s more to come very shortly including the ability to program the DVR from your cell phone, view FaceBook on your TV screen and search and view YouTube clips on the TV with your remote. These features, enhancements and upgrades help highlight the growth potential of the FiOS platform. On the Broadband side we added 129,000 new subscribers about 140% better than last quarter. FiOS internet ads jumped up to 225,000 and we saw some improvement in DSL. FiOS internet penetration now stands at 24% which is an improvement of more than 300 basis points this year. Fiber to the home now covers more than one third of our households and nearly 70% of these homes path can buy our video service. As we move into the end of this year we\u2019re on track with our FiOS build out and ahead of expectations with FiOS TV penetration.  On the traditional access line side of the business we did not see a significant sequential change in retail residential primary lines which were down 571,000 and total switch access lines declined by one million. As I said earlier FiOS remains the center of our consumer strategy and it has helped offset secular line loss trends.  As you can see on slide 10 broadband and video continued to be the big drivers of consumer revenue growth. Legacy consumer revenues in the quarter were up 2.1% year over year. Broadband and video revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter up 45% from a year ago. We are also seeing consistently strong growth in consumer retail ARPU which is now nearly $67 up 12.8% from a year ago. The overall FiOS ARPU continues to grow and is more than $130 per month. The FiOS triple play ARPU is even higher. Now let\u2019s take a look at Verizon Business, revenues from IP and strategic products continue to show solid growth up over 15% in the third quarter. Sales funnels remain strong and we\u2019ve had some major customer wins. Total revenue growth for Verizon Business improved this quarter to 1.2% from last quarters 0.9%. Pricing remains competitive particularly for long term contracts with the largest enterprise customers. We will remain disciplined and balance market share wins and margins. Although we have not seen any significant impact from the financial services sector yet consolidation in this sector may have some impact in the next couple of quarters. As I look at the business segment there continues to be a shift to strategic services like private IP, managed services and security. We continue to work through some strategic take back losses from earlier this year and closely monitor the financial services sector. We\u2019re pursuing Federal Government networks contract opportunities and we continue to expand our international products and capabilities such as the private IP network in India. In summarizing Wireline I\u2019d like to say that we\u2019ve continued to make progress in improving the overall revenue mix as broadband and video revenue now comprise 29% of legacy consumer revenues as compared with 20% a year ago. We continue to believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in both the consumer and business markets. Our Wireline EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 27.3%. While we remain committed to expanding Wireline margins we now believe that our original improvement targets will take longer to achieve than originally planned. With regard to FiOS we are on plan both financially and operationally. Finally, we remain focused on reducing the Wireline cost structure. We have a good track record of taking costs out of the business. For example, we have reduced our Wireline work force by more than 10,000 positions in the past year. We also have additional cost reduction initiatives underway which will help lower our overall Wireline expenses. To summarize, through the first nine months of the year we have delivered revenue, earnings and free cash flow growth. Our balance sheet is healthy and we have access to liquidity. The 7% dividend increase announced last month reflects the confidence we have in our cash flow outlook. Verizon\u2019s dividend yield currently ranks within the top 10% of the S&P 500. From my perspective the quarter was solid. Volumes and revenues in our key strategic area grew, the capital intensity of the business continues to improve and cash flow remains strong. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Ron.\nRon Lataille: We\u2019re now available to take questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik \u2013 UBS.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Were you guys surprised with the strength that we saw in the iPhone this quarter and given the margin guidance are you going to be able to maintain the net add momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter and next year? I think Ivan said there is still expected to be accretion in the first year of the Alltel deal are we still talking in the neighborhood of about a dime?\nDenny Strigl: I think your iPhone question probably relates to churn. Our churn rate remained very low in the quarter as you saw. On a sequential basis we tend to see some seasonality in the third quarter about 10 basis points. I\u2019m not really concerned about the year over year churn which was up about six basis points. Specifically to your question on the iPhone, yes of course we did see some churn to the iPhone during the quarter. Our focus has been on a broad based portfolio of devices and maintaining our margins in the 43% to 45% level we think we will be able to do that into the future. Our plan is certainly to continue to grow at the kinds of numbers you have seen in this quarter. We have a very competitive model in Wireless, I think you know this. We meet the competition head on. We\u2019re not whetted to just any one iconic device. We\u2019re pleased with our result and I think you can continue to see similar results that\u2019s our plan going forward.\nIvan Seidenberg: The issue on the Alltel accretion the way we would look at it is that we\u2019re not prepared to give a specific level of guidance on this. The early estimates as you said were about a dime and a lot of that is being eaten up by some of the financing costs. We still have some work to do in terms of the sequencing of the financing and we have 120 days after the final approvals. The business is performing very well so one of the things that we\u2019re very pleased with is the Alltel management people have done a very good job of maintaining their focus during this period of time. I think as we get more insight into the operating plan we\u2019ll be able to determine and give you better outlook as we get closer to actual close. Our goal is to still make sure in year ones its accretive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Good progress on capital spending bringing down both the absolute and the percent of revenues. Can you talk a little bit about what we should see in 2009 given some of the macro concerns and also where we are in terms of ability to start spending on LTE and any improvements in the efficiency of cost per home pass installed on the FiOS side.\nDenny Strigl: We have begun spending on LTE. We have a trial that is going. We are not disclosing specific spending on LTE. I can tell you looking at our capital spend plans for next year we\u2019ll continue to bring our spend as a percent of revenue down. We will probably given the economic circumstances that we\u2019re in we will probably start out slower in the first quarter than what we did first quarter this year. At this point that\u2019s about all we\u2019re prepared to say about capital other than you can see it continue to come down as a percent of revenue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan.\nMike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan: Can you give us maybe a little more clarity on the Wireline margin improvement story and the levers there? I know you mentioned FiOS sort of tracking in line with your expectations but can you give us any sort of magnitude on what kind of a drag it is right now? Also on the VZ Business side can you give us a sense for what the margins look like there?\nDenny Strigl: Looking at Wireline margin FiOS is on plan. Our productivity on FiOS is on track. As you saw we had better volumes in the quarter, with some additional promotional activity. We\u2019re feeling good from the standpoint of our productivity and our FiOS plans. We had contract wins in Verizon Business as I said during the quarter. Some of those wins come with up front costs. We\u2019ve seen more competitive pricing in Verizon Business. Of course we\u2019ve seen this secular pressures continue in our Telco group.  We continue to manage the cost structure like forced reductions that we are undertaking now primarily in Telco but also some consolidation on the business side additionally. We expect to hold margins in the fourth quarter. We continue to target a long term goal of 30% to 33% margins for Wireline. The timing may be longer than expected. The uncertainty of the economy of course adds some risk to the timing. Improving Wireline margins clearly we can say it will be driven by a number of things, continued FiOS scale and productivity improvements, reducing our structural costs including access rates in VZB which we\u2019ve been working on for the last 18 months or so and seeing some progress there. We will increase non-access cost bearing services, the reductions like managed services, IP infrastructure we think we\u2019ve got some cost savings to realize there. We have been focused on that over the course of this year. Of course we will continue to focus on cost reductions like force automation, our VSO organization helps in that regard. Again, we expect to hold margins in the fourth quarter in spite of the economy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup: Following up on some of the comments about trying to curtail costs, I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about the opportunities for headcount reduction. I think you announced some in the quarter. Also if you go back five years ago after the last union contract if I remember correctly there was a voluntary program and the reductions I think were on a net basis or about 18,000 five years ago in the fourth quarter of \u201903. I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunities to help margins from those types of cost cutting activities over the next 12 months.\nIvan Seidenberg: Perhaps I can just give a broader comment on this subject. If you watched over the past three or four years we\u2019ve had a steady decrease in employee headcount. In those portions of the business that\u2019s going through the biggest transition. You can see steady quarter over quarter and year over year transformation of the headcount reduction in the Telco and you can see the charge that Doreen described this quarter of 2,700 management people its just part of that. I think it would be fair to say that with that we\u2019ll continue to work on reducing other headcount in the Telco namely associates as we continue to roll out FiOS. We\u2019ve been doing that on a consistent steady basis. There\u2019s nothing in the union contract that either triggers that or prevents us from doing that. I think that what we wanted to make sure in this current contract is that we didn\u2019t lose any of the flexibility that we had been using for the past three or four years. That\u2019s kind of where we are. I would also make the point that we\u2019ve also had significant opportunities and we\u2019ve done this to remove structural costs at VZB and we\u2019ve done that as well. Denny might comment on a couple of the broader areas that we\u2019re looking at but for the most part we\u2019re dealing with continued improvements in operational flexibility with our networks and we\u2019re dealing with minding the value out of our Verizon services organization to do better with procurement, network operations and things of that nature. Of course you know we continue to add headcount in Wireless where we need it. Overall you should expect the headcount number to come down in those parts of the company in which we\u2019re transforming the business and as technology keeps eating away at the access line base moving many of those lines to Wireless you will see us continue to transform the base.\nDenny Strigl: I would just add one, this is down in the weeds a bit but we have numerous real estate consolidation occurring. This should save us money into \u201909. A lot of consolidation particularly related to the downsizing in our Telco force.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden - Banc of America.\nDavid Barden - Banc of America: On the Alltel transaction I think you kind of alluded to the fact that the difference in the credit markets today versus when the deal was struck has eroded. I think you said a good portion of the potential dime that was there the FCC is considering eliminating CEDC revenues which are a meaningful percentage of the ARPU of Alltel. I guess I understand the point that it can be done but is this a deal that still should be done under the current terms and conditions that you\u2019ve agreed to? Why wouldn\u2019t it be better for the shareholders to take advantage of your potential strength in this negotiation and try for something more attractive? The second question on FiOS being on track, I know you\u2019ve targeted EBITDA positive in the second half of \u201908 I was wondering if you could tell us if you hit that and whether what we\u2019re seeing on the DSL front was originally part of the business plan for FiOS and whether FiOS can really hit its plan if DSL is still falling at about $100,000 a quarter.\nDoreen Toben: FiOS is on plan and is actually EBITDA positive this quarter so we\u2019re very pleased with that. On your DSL question no I don\u2019t think it will impact the FiOS net adds at all we will continue. We\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing certainly into the late part of the quarter and continue to be on plan which is why we\u2019ve actually upped some our own estimates on where we think we be with FiOS, very strong there.\nIvan Seidenberg: The Alltel transaction as I said in the opening is compelling so you start with the early estimate of $9 billion and NTV coming from the deal. You look at the fact that when you look at the future synergies of combining the Alltel customer base and the network with us I think the operating opportunities for leverage are just off the chart. The issue is that when we look at this short term issue of financing and some of these FCC issues on US, first of all the book isn\u2019t finely written on all those things so my guess is we shouldn\u2019t be drinking the Kool-Aid until we see all of the final conditions on that. When it\u2019s all said and done this is a transaction that pays for itself, probably will pay for itself multiple times over. We do have admittedly an issue in which the early returns will be lower than we thought but in no way will the long term benefit of this deal be negated by some of these short term issues. It is a deal that should get done and is a deal that, by the way I would make a point that the speed at which Government is looking at this should tell everybody that even they think this is a deal that should get done.  We haven\u2019t had to push them as hard as we normally would because they\u2019re looking at this and they\u2019re suggesting that telecommunications is one of the stable industries right now and all of this turmoil that\u2019s going on and a little consolidation is a good thing. We even read about some of it this morning in the [inaudible] base. I think it\u2019s a good thing for people to see that kind of consolidation. Yes, we agree that it didn\u2019t quite meet what we originally thought but in the longer term it\u2019s going to exceed everything we ever thought.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Sykes \u2013 Barclays.\nTom Sykes \u2013 Barclays: I think you mentioned in your opening remarks that homes open for sale is going to increase as New York City ramps. Can you give us some sort of idea of the magnitude of that? For example, in 4Q07 I think you opened 1.2 million new home opened for sale. In first quarter it was closer to 500,000. Are we going to be north of a million for the next several quarters or somewhere in between that range?\nDenny Strigl: Actually where we will be is very close to what you saw in the third quarter. We did have New York City opening in the third quarter but we continue to ramp up I\u2019d say that our range will be in about the one million level.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse.\nChris Larsen - Credit Suisse: A point of clarification do you need to sell the 105 markets that need to be divested in order to close the Alltel transaction? The last recession we saw a slower wireless growth which eventually led to competitive pricing. We\u2019re in a different environment now that where everybody\u2019s got significant share. How do you think either Verizon plays itself out in a slower wireless market or how some of your competitors may also play it out?\nDenny Strigl: We\u2019re really not seeing any significant slow down or impact in Wireless at this point. We\u2019re right on the target that we had set for ourselves. We don\u2019t see any shifting to lower priced packages, but as you may have seen in our numbers a very good data growth. Our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to see that data accelerate. We had 80 billion text messages alone in the quarter. A big part of that is text but also use of email, PDA, SmartPhones, I think we\u2019ve got a good growth opportunity going forward.\nIvan Seidenberg: On the Alltel question we will be permitted to put the markets in trust and they will be operated separately. I might add by the way when you put all those subscribers into our company it\u2019s a fairly substantially sized business. It will be operated separate and are out the close the deal pending the final sales of those properties.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: Do you expect any other regulatory changes out of the FCC between now and the end of the year? They sent out a fairly large agenda for the meeting next week. Secondly on the enterprise business front do you think the pricing pressure is coming more from competition or is it just more from new technologies bundling voice and with data. It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of competitors out there really on the business front it\u2019s really just you and AT&T have the lion\u2019s share of the market out there.\nDenny Strigl: I don\u2019t see anything other than everything we all know about what the FCC is going. I think obviously the devil is always in the details. We\u2019re doing our part to work through it but I think the November 4th agenda is the last big thing for the year. Hopefully there are a lot of things that the FCC is doing that we think will continue to make the industry more rational depending on the absolute details and we\u2019re working our way through that. I don\u2019t see anything of a major surprise happening November 4th.\nIvan Seidenberg: On the enterprise competition question I think this is coming strictly from competition. It is competition that is driving the prices down. We know this; we participate in every big deal across the country and around the world. Our goal here is to be very careful in balancing our new customers, resigning our existing customers and protecting the margin at the same time. As I mentioned in my opening remarks our goal is to grow at GDP plus levels.  Some of the new product that we see which includes by the way just more bandwidth that customers are asking for but also new applications and managed services, those come at a very good profit margin for us, as you see in our numbers some very good growth out of managed services in particular. The overall answer to your question is competition is what\u2019s impacting pricing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: On Wireless, what percent of the customer base upgraded handsets this quarter? I know you talked about the external channel 30% of gross adds coming in on SmartPhones. What is that percentage look like for the subscribers upgrading within your own base? I know it\u2019s early but any comments on pensions in terms of the magnitude of the EPS impact in \u201909. Do you think there\u2019s going to be any sort cash contribution requirements in the pension funds?\nDoreen Toben: Similar to any other investor\u2019s portfolio certainly our portfolio is negative at this point. Where it ends the year is anybody\u2019s guess at this point as far as end of December. We do have a smoothing impact so it will take us five years to smooth it in. Depending on the discount rate which we can\u2019t pick until December 31st there might be some mitigation. We really don\u2019t know the full impact from a P&L standpoint until the end of December. However, from a funding perspective our last K had a number of a little bit over $300 million. Current course and speed that is still a good number for funding in \u201909 so in the $300 million assuming the fund is sort of where it is as of mid-October. As far as the upgrade number that is not a number that we give out as far as percentage of upgrades.\nRon Lataille: That will conclude our questions and I\u2019d like to hand it off to Ivan now for a couple of summary comments.\nIvan Seidenberg: Thank you all for attending the call. A couple of quick points, if there are any points of emphasis we\u2019d like you to consider this quarter a couple of things. First of all we had what we thought is a good quarter in light of this entire economic uncertainty around the world. A couple things unique to us is that our business shows remarkable stability and strength. We think we have an approach to dealing with the competitive forces that will continue to allow us to sustain good performance in this marketplace. In Wireless you can see we have the belief we can continue to grow. We can continue to add vertical capabilities and ARPU\u2019s and at the same time manage our costs and our overall business to maintain our margin levels. FiOS what we\u2019re seeing is in spite of all of the secular shifts going on we were able to increase ARPU\u2019s and increase penetration so that is a physics problem for us which is how quickly can we get the stuff deployed and as Denny said we\u2019re two thirds of the way through which is pretty significant. We have very, very specific performance metrics that we have been meeting now for the past two or three years and you can see that. In Verizon Enterprise what you see there is that we also have a very disciplined approach. Our sales activities are very vibrant but we are running into the fact that customers are beginning to time some of their spending a little differently. As Denny said we\u2019re working really hard to make sure that we improve the product mix within Verizon Business so we can keep adding all of those strategic capabilities that customers are looking for. The unspoken thing on this call is this whole issue of access line loss and just very quickly what I\u2019d like to say on that is that we\u2019re not surprised at the access line loss. We\u2019ve been saying now for a couple years that DSL itself was going to become less potent. Wireless is obviously much more of a substitute capability going forward.  The issue for us is that this issue of Wireline margins and access line losses trying to balance this issue on the head of a pin has been difficult. What we feel is that we have momentum going in all of the growth areas so that as we get through this tunnel and we are beginning to see light at the end of it we can start to continue to show a lot of growth.  Somebody earlier mentioned that they see our CapEx to spending ratio as coming down so you can see that all of the capital that we\u2019ve been putting into these growth areas is starting to give us some leverage to improve the capital ratios and return on investor capital for the business.  Lastly, we tried to give you some outlook for the fourth quarter. We think an 8% EPS return in this environment is a very good result along with a 7% dividend. We\u2019re anxious to talk to you about 2009 and we\u2019ll do that in January. With that we think you all for your attending the call.\nRon Lataille: That concludes our call today. We appreciate your being on.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference you may disconnect at this time. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-07-28 15:21:13", "content": "Executives:  Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Doreen Toben - Chief Financial Officer Denny Strigl - President and Chief Operating Officer\nAnalysts: John Hodulik - UBS Michael Rollins - Citigroup David Barden - Banc of America Securities Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Michael McCormack - J.P. Morgan Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Christopher Larsen - Credit Suisse\nOperator:  Welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille:  I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. As you know, we completed the spin off of access lines to FairPoint at the end of the first quarter, so our second quarter results do not include these properties. For purposes of comparability we have made available reclassified historical information on our website. These reclassifications affected revenues, expenses and operating income. Prior period earnings are unaffected by these reclassifications. We have also adjusted the appropriate volume metrics, so all the growth rates and prior period information presented in our earnings materials are on a comparable basis.  Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I'd like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the second quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.66. Adjusted earnings per share, before the effects of special items were $0.67. The only special item we excluded from adjusted results this quarter is a charge of $22 million after-tax or $0.01 per share for MCI merger integration costs.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen.\nDoreen Toben:  The good momentum in our key strategic areas allowed us to turn in another quarter of mid-single digit revenue growth, continued margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth. So from a financial perspective, we met our key performance metrics. Verizon Wireless had a very strong quarter, with revenue growth of nearly 12%, 1.5 million retail net adds, record low churn, and an EBITDA margin of over 45%. Continued penetration of FiOS drove broadband and video revenues to $1.2 billion this quarter, and with Verizon Business, strategic service revenues grew about 19%. In terms of profitability, operating income margins increased to 19% and our EBITDA margins grew to 33.9%. Margin expansion is being driven by Wireless as well as improving FiOS efficiencies.  Our $0.67 of diluted EPS from continuing operations this quarter was up 15.5% year-over-year.  We also had another strong quarter of cash generation. With steady capital spending and revenues continuing to grow, our capital efficiency has improved, a trend we expect will continue. Clearly, our network investments, together with the strength of our products and services, are enabling growth at both the top and bottom lines.  Now let's cover some of the details. As you can see on Slide 4, over the past year we've been able to sustain strong earnings performance through consolidated revenue growth and steady margin expansion. This quarter was no exception.  Our top line grew $1.1 billion or 4.9% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, quarterly revenues increased $549 million or 2.3%.  Operating income grew over $450 million or 10.9% year-over-year, and the margin increased 100 basis points.  Our second quarter EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points year-over-year to 33.9%.  Continued mid-single digit revenue growth and steady margin expansion resulted in $0.67 EPS this quarter.  On the next slide you can see our strong cash generation profile. For the first half of this year cash flow from continuing operations was about $12.1 billion, up 4.2% compared with last year. We believe very strongly that our disciplined investment in networks and new technologies will continue to provide the platform for growth, innovation and productivity.  Our revenue growth and slightly lower capital spending is improving the capital intensity of the business. For the first half of the year, total Capex was $8.4 billion, which is around $100 million less than we spent at this time last year. Our Capex to revenue for the first half was 17.6%, an improvement of 120 basis points compared with a year ago.  Our higher debt balance is from borrowings relating to the purchase of the 700 megahertz spectrum and the upfront purchase of bridge debt in the pending Alltel acquisition. These two strategic investments strengthen our overall growth outlook and provide the opportunity to further expand our wireless market leadership. We have made the determination to capitalize the interest on the wireless licenses while they are being readied for commercial use. As a result, we incurred no incremental interest expense in the quarter related to these borrowings. Now let's look at our segment results, beginning with Verizon Wireless on Slide 6. We had another strong quarter of customer growth, particularly in the retail market. Total net adds for the second quarter were 1.5 million, essentially all of which were retail post-paid. We now have 68.7 million total customers, which are largely retail. We only have 2 million reseller customers in our base, and our 66.7 million retail customers are largely post-paid, about 2.9 million or 4% are prepaid.  Gross add performance was very strong again this quarter, with retail growth adds up 3.2% and nearly 5% for the first half compared with last year. Our industry leading churn rates were a record low this quarter, with total churn of 1.12% and retail post-paid churn of 0.83%, which improvements both sequentially and year-over-year.  Clearly, we are gaining share. Throughout last year we took between 50% and 55% of retail post-paid net adds among the top four carriers. In the first quarter, we took 78%. Since only two of us have reported so far, we don't know what the percentage will be this quarter, but we believe this will be a very impressive number once again.  Turning to revenues, we had another strong performance sustaining double-digit growth. Service revenue grew to $10.5 billion this quarter, up 11.6% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. Total service ARPU increased 0.9% to $51.53.  More than 70% of the growth in total service revenue is from wireless data, and data now represents 24.4% of total service revenue. The drivers of growth are broadband access, e-mail and messaging. Data revenues in the quarter grew 45% year-over-year and nearly 10% sequentially. Data ARPU was up 31% over last year. About 60% of this growth is from non-messaging services. Mobile broadband access through PC cards and e-mail through integrated devices and PDAs are experiencing very high growth. There is plenty of upside here, particularly as we penetrate the small and medium businesses and enterprise markets. Roughly 60% of our retail base currently has a broadband capable device.  In the near term, the introduction of new devices and new applications, like our push-to-talk product, will drive revenue growth.  Next year, our Rural Cellular and Alltel acquisitions will provide further opportunities for growth. Later this year you will be hearing more about some new converged service applications and product integrations between wireless and our FiOS platform that will be very much differentiated in the marketplace as well as some managed mobility solutions for global enterprise customers. Beyond that, our enhance spectrum position, our 4G plans with LTE, and the innovation that will be fostered by our open development initiative will provide excellent future growth opportunities in the area of wireless data.  In summary, our strong Wireless performance demonstrates our ability to execute in a very competitive environment. Our sharp focus on retention and further improving operational efficiency has resulted in industry leading profitability and is generating substantial cash flow.  EBITDA grew 5.1% on a sequential basis and 11.3% yearover-year with a very strong 45.6% EBITDA margin on service revenue this quarter.  Our capital spending totaled around $3.3 billion for the first half of the year, which is about 4% less than last year at this time. Our Capex to revenue ratio for the first half was 13.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points from a year ago.  So our Wireless strategy and outlook are unchanged. Our primary focus is on maintaining double-digit revenue growth and strong cash generation, and we will continue to prudently strive for growth while maintaining productivity within our stated range of 43% to 45% EBITDA margins. Let's next move to Wireline, starting with customer growth in the consumer and small business markets.  In terms of secular and competitive challenges, there is really nothing new here. We continue to see access line losses at roughly the same levels. FiOS is demonstrating continued strength in the marketplace, and we've achieved very good penetration in a relatively short period of time.  In addition we have a substantial growth opportunity as we launch FiOS TV service in New York City today. At the end of the quarter our FiOS TV customer base was 1.4 million, which is 20% penetration. During the quarter we added 176,000 net new customers. More than half of our markets are above 20% penetration.  In FiOS Internet we ended the quarter with 2 million customers, representing 24% penetration. About half of our markets are above 25% penetration and a [skewer] north of 30%.  DSL was a net negative 133,000 customers this quarter. Total broadband subscribers, that is, DSL plus FiOS Internet, now stand at 8.3 million, which is up 11.5% from a year ago.  Although the broadband market is maturing, it is clear that demand for higher speeds and more bandwidth is increasing, which supports our FiOS strategy. We are seeing evidence of this today, whether it's customers opting for higher-speed DSL or a DSL customer migrating to FiOS, or even a FiOS customer opting for higher speeds. We now offer 50 megabytes down and 20 megabytes up through our entire FiOS footprint. No other company can match these upstream speeds. The sequential decline in FiOS net adds was due primarily to a lower level of promotions, marketing and advertising activities during the quarter. For example, we ended our free TV offer. We expect promotional activity to increase in the third quarter, in part to support our New York City video launch. Our New York City video franchise covers 3 million premises throughout all five boroughs, about 2 million of which are in multi-dwelling units or MDUs. To date we've already passed about 25%, with a target to pass around 30% or about 900,000 premises by the end of 2008. In Staten Island, where we already offer FiOS Internet in many locations, our goal is to pass 98% with video by year end. And in Manhattan our goal is to pass 57% with video by the end of this year. Effective today there will be about 300,000 video homes open for sale with a year end target of 500,000.  I'm also very excited to announce that effective today we are now offering 100 high definition channels in the New York City and Northern New Jersey areas. This is clearly a significant higher number of HD channels than cable competitors currently offer. It also highlights the additional value we offer FiOS customers and further differentiates that FiOS platform.  Now with more than 11 million homes currently passed by FiOS, we are clearly gaining scale and momentum. To put this in perspective, a little more than 20% of our entire landline footprint can get the triple play today. Our triple play coverage will grow to at least 60% of our total homes, strengthening our ability to retain customers. As these customers increase their spending with us, it will not only help revenue metrics but also our cash flow. With regard to access lines, our quarterly losses continue to track within a range. During the second quarter total switch line losses were 920,000. There is usually a seasonal increase in disconnects in the second quarter, so I'd say we haven't seen any substantial changes in trend. From a consumer revenue perspective, broadband and video are clearly the growth drivers, topping the $1 billion mark in the second quarter. Broadband and video revenues now represent 28% of legacy consumer revenues this quarter and were up 53% year-over-year. Revenues from these services are also driving consistent growth in consumer retail ARPU, which is now nearly $64, up 10.4% from a year ago.  The continued deployment of FiOS and increased penetration of available homes will drive further growth in revenue and ARPU, especially as we increase triple play availability, which now stands at 84% of FiOS Internet homes open for sale. The blended FiOS ARPU is slightly over $130 per month. And since not everyone has all three services, the FiOS triple play is even higher. Now let's take a look at Verizon Business. In this market we continue to see solid demand and our sales funnel remains strong. We have seen some pricing stability in certain products, but it obviously remains a very competitive market.  The top chart on Slide 11 displays our global retail enterprise revenue, which is our primary strategic focus. Second quarter revenues were up 1.7%.  As we've discussed before, recent quarter growth rates have been negatively affected by strategic takebacks, with certain customers moving traffic off our network. Excluding this effect in the second quarter, global retail enterprise growth would have been over 3%.  We expect second half revenue growth rates will improve, especially in the fourth quarter, as we have some significant contract wins that will begin revenue contributions later this year.  Total revenues of $5.3 billion for Verizon Business grew 0.9% year-over-year.  Strategic services now represent 28% of total Verizon Business revenue. Revenue associated with these services, mainly private IP, managed services and security, grew about 19% year-over-year.  In summary, we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively based on the positive momentum and demand for our key strategic products. Wireline EBITDA margin was 27.3%, which is up 60 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. As for top line growth, we expect the customer demand for FiOS to continue, and we certainly have a great near-term opportunity ahead of us in the New York City market. We are also making progress in our discussions with some other large cities. Also, we expect our strategic services in the enterprise space to continue growing as more businesses transition to IP and look to companies like ours to manage their networks and provide data security. In addition to these revenue growth opportunities, we also have significant opportunities to reduce costs. We remain committed to further margin expansion, and we are targeting improvements during the second half of this year.  We expect operational improvements in FiOS to continue. Our capital unit costs are trending lower as we scale, and we continue to be focused on productivity. We have made steady progress in reducing the costs of provisioning FiOS.  In addition to other areas, like system consolidation and access cost reductions, we've got a number of cost reduction opportunities we are pursuing, many of which involve our centralized network, IT, marketing and service organizations.  Broadly speaking, we have programs to eliminate costs through network simplification. We are looking at work center consolidation, [forcing] savings in fleet and energy management programs. We've got quite a few automation and self-service programs under way to reduce average handling times and increase use of the web and automated voice services. A lot of activity, but more to do. In summary, we are on track to meet our financial objectives, and we delivered a solid quarter. Our strategies are intact, and our long-term outlook is unchanged, with opportunities for continued revenue growth and steady margin improvement and the ability to generate cash and deliver double-digit earnings growth over the planning period.  As far as pending transactions are concerned, we believe that the closing of the Rural Cellular acquisition is imminent. The Alltel approval process is well under way, and we remain optimistic that it will close by year end.  In terms of our outlook for the second half of the year we see our positive momentum continuing, and we don't expect any significant economic impacts. We may begin to see some softening volumes, especially in the financial sector, but we do not expect this to significantly affect our business plan. We expect consolidated results to post solid mid-single digit revenue growth, steadily increasing margins, strong cash generation, and meet earnings growth expectations.  As far as capital spending is concerned, we are confident that we will be below our 2007 amount of $17.5 billion, with both Wireline and Wireless being less than last year, and this includes an estimated $200 million in capital related to the Rural Cellular integration.  Our strong cash outlook gives us the ability to continue investing for growth, and we are comfortable in considering a dividend increase with our Board in the fall.  And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Ron.\nRon Lataille:  We're now ready for questions.\nOperator:   (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik - UBS.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS:  The FiOS video numbers were a little lower than expectations. Can you give us a sense of how you expect that to trend in the second half and maybe '09 versus '08, given the new promotions and new markets you guys are opening up? And maybe some detail on the slowdown, you know, in terms of penetration of new markets or whether you're seeing slowdown really more in mature markets? And then related to that, do you expect the new promotions in the third quarter to have any impact or noticeable impact on the margins?\nDenny Strigl:  First, so FiOS net adds in the second quarter were actually about what we had expected coming off of the very good first quarter, which was that free high-def TV. We expect third quarter net adds to increase and sales, even so far in early June, are trending higher. We continue to expand homes passed and open for sale, and we think we have the opportunity to improve net adds also with our New York City launch which occurred this morning.  There will also be increased marketing around the New York City launch, and we're now offering 100 HD channels on our FiOS TV service, as you heard in Doreen's comments. So this will be more high definition, incidentally, than our cable competition, so we're expecting an upturn on our FiOS numbers in the third quarter.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: And any impact on the margins from the increased activity, Doreen, or do you expect to continue to see sequential improvement?\nDoreen Toben: No, John, I would say that we will continue to see improvement in the second half of the year, you know, consistent to what we've said. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins - Citigroup.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup:  Just a follow up with two quick questions. Just one on the Wireline margin front, you talked about the 80 to 100 bips guidance beforehand for the full year margin improvement, and I was wondering, you know, following the second quarter where we are along that track and if you see some increment - you've mentioned some items, but if you see any incremental items really being the key factors to delivering that margin expansion? And then just secondly, on the consumer business, what are you seeing in terms of where the incremental line loss is going? Do you feel it's going more wireless? Do you feel it's going more to cable or VoIP? And just any thoughts on how that should move over the next sort of 12 to 18 months. Is it going to be steady? Do you think there'll be more competition or less? \nDenny Strigl: Okay, Mike, I'll start this and ask Doreen to add her thoughts. But we have not changed our margin targets. Both Doreen and I remain convinced that we can improve Wireline margins and that our long-term goal of - you've heard us say this before - 30% to 33% is very achievable. So the organization is focused on driving both top line and bottom line improvement, and we should be on a run rate of at least 28% in the fourth quarter of this year. So, Doreen, anything to add?\nDoreen Toben: I think on the [margin,] the only thing I'd say is, you know, obviously there's puts and takes that will affect it in the short term. We'll see where the volumes are for the third and fourth quarter. Also obviously the contract. I'll have to see if there's anything major of different than I was expecting coming out of the contract. But having said all that, you know, I continue to be very comfortable with double-digit earnings growth for the year.  And I would, you know, we have always said I am very comfortable. There's lots more cost-saving opportunities that come. So we're comfortable with the revenues, see that there are more cost savings that we can come in, and the 30% to 33%, you know, target has not changed at all. \nDenny Strigl: So Mike, on the line loss question that you asked, first of all, I don't see that this will spike further. I mean, you know, we work very hard to try to contain this. It is higher than what we had been geared for, but the fact of the matter is that it is very stiff competition that we're receiving from cable and also there is a wireless impact. It is our estimate that we see probably half of our line loss going to wireless service. But then at the same time I think it's important to say going forward we will continue to focus on growing our FiOS areas out as we do, and we continue to offer triple play packages, as Doreen had indicated in her comments. We have great success in competing with the cable companies. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden - Banc of America Securities.\nDavid Barden - Banc of America Securities:  First just on the Wireless, obviously no complaints about performance there, but ARPU was a little bit lighter than we were looking for. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about puts and takes. We know Sprint's out there being very aggressive on, you know, giving away free months of service and such trying to hold onto their customer base. There's obviously been a ramp up, presumably, in some of the $100 unlimited plan take rates. I wonder if you could kind of talk about the trend in those variables? And then the second question if I could, just, Denny and Doreen, on your commentary, is that all kind of assuming that the union relationship kind of continues as it is currently, or, you know, what kind of costs could conceivably be incurred if contingency plans have to be put in place later in the quarter?\nDenny Strigl: Well, David, on the wireless ARPU, our total ARPU this quarter was up, as you saw, $0.48 year-over-year, up $0.62 from the first quarter. And, by the way, our data ARPU this quarter was up $3.00 year-over-year and that's up $0.86 sequentially. So these are good numbers, and we're still trending higher. In fact, we've had nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year ARPU growth. So, as you know, our business model is focused on our post-paid market, which has better characteristics than high reseller and prepaid business models. We've had some good wins, incidentally, in the business market this quarter. And when that occurs on the business side, somewhat like the family share plans, we see somewhat lower ARPU initially but then there's more data upside from broadband and e-mail opportunities that we see over time on those business accounts. And, of course, the whole business opportunity that we've realized helps us drive our churn levels even lower. So I guess going forward - and you've heard us say this before - I would ask us to think in broader terms, our ARPU being just one measure. I think we need to balance the ARPU with our leading churn rates, with EBITDA growth and overall with the quality of our customer base. We're quite pleased with the ARPU growth that we've had in the quarter.\nDoreen Toben: And I guess, David, you know, they're in the middle of negotiations, so I don't think it's, you know, appropriate to comment on this very much, but obviously you've got salary and wage, you've got pension [bands], and you've got OPEB as big swings, and countless other things.\nDavid Barden - Banc of America Securities: Doreen, more on that, on the financial impact.\nDenny Strigl: I'd like to comment just a step further on union negotiations, because we know that's been on all of your minds. So we are optimistic that we'll reach a fair settlement for our company. We have been making good progress. The key issues really haven't changed, they're wage increases, health care benefits, work rules. And I really would like you to know that our work force has been very excited about our video opportunities, particularly in New York City. It's an opportunity in New York and in other major cities as we roll out that will create new jobs and plenty of work for our existing work force. So, you know, having said that, questions about where do we go with a strike, we think it would be unfortunate if a strike occurred, but we'll deal with it if and when it comes. In the meantime, we'll work hard to reach a fair settlement for our company as quickly as possible.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley:  Denny, some interesting wireless initiatives that I think Doreen touched on in the call, push-to-talk, rolling that out, integrating FiOS and wireless and then some managed mobility solutions. Perhaps you can give a little bit more color on some of those. And then, Doreen, just a quick one - what should we be thinking about for the tax rate in the second half? \nDenny Strigl: Simon, on the push-to-talk, last week we announced a new push-to-talk device along with our partner Motorola. Of course, it leverages our EVDO Rev A network and is actually available in our stores starting today. Unlimited push-to-talk is $10 per month on any line that has a nationwide voice plan.  So we'll offer more devices, incidentally, in the future, and we have a second device coming up shortly, but I have to be candid with you here. I see push-to-talk as just another part of our very broad product line. So this is one product; we think we have some upside. But again, it is just one product.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: And you've got the latency fixed on that now? It's coming in.\nDenny Strigl: You know, Simon, I think we're in very good shape on latency, unlike what you saw from us a couple of years ago. We're in a good place.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Good. And anything on the FiOS?\nDoreen Toben: Simon, I would say currently we're sort of working with federal, state and nonU.S. settlements between now and the end of the year, and so with that sort of as a caveat, I think the range is sort of 34% to 36%.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael McCormack - J.P. Morgan.\nMichael McCormack - J.P. Morgan:  On the small and medium size marketplace, can you give us a sense for what you're seeing there trend-wise, whether or not you're seeing incremental cable competition as well? And secondly, on the enterprise trend, it seems like we've had a couple of data points out there about, you know, slower decision making or just a little bit more of a sluggish environment. Can you give us a sense if there's any sort of price competition that's resulting from that environment? And then lastly, maybe just some preliminary comments on what impact you may be seeing right now from the iPhone launch?\nDenny Strigl: Okay. A number of questions there, Mike. So, looking overall at the iPhone launch, let me start with that question. As we saw with the initial introduction of Apple's iPhone, we are seeing what we think is the same. It is a minimal short-term impact. I would have to say that the impact has been disproportionately less than our relative market share, so we think that that's a good sign.  Apple's iPhone has actually caused what we think is a stimulation of the sales of smart phones, so if we look at our PDAs and integrated devices, we're now over 30% of our handset sales. And, as you can see from our net add results over the last three or four quarters, since the iPhone hit the market we continue to be well positioned. And our continued success, by the way, is based on our focus on the best network and best customer service and actually not on any one device. So you asked about small business, looking at what's occurring there we've seen some competition at the low end of the small business market. There's no doubt about it. That has come from - primarily from the cable companies. But revenues actually on small business were also impacted by some of our bundled discounting. So we're expanding FiOS Internet and video in the small business market, especially to the multi-tenant units, the MTU areas. And I think we've got some good opportunity going forward in the small business market, particularly with our FiOS product.\nMichael McCormack - J.P. Morgan: And then just on the overall competitiveness in enterprise, any pricing actions going on or is that pretty stable?\nDenny Strigl: Okay, we do - we have really nothing new to report that Doreen and I hadn't already mentioned I think last quarter. We do see some force downsizing, office closures, sales delays, decision delays in some of the financial services sector. However, our enterprise sales funnels remain strong, and when you add new business wins and opportunities, we really don't expect that the net effect will have any significant impact on our financial results. But Doreen might want to comment further on that.\nDoreen Toben: No, I think, you know, we've seen, you know, enterprise has been resilient to the industry. So when you look at other sectors, though, I think that that's been a real positive for us.\nMichael McCormack - J.P. Morgan: Are you guys seeing a disproportionate impact on the SME marketplace with respect to the economy versus large enterprise?\nDoreen Toben: I don't think so. Certainly on the enterprise, you know, it's easier for us to see. It's more segmented. But I would say probably not.\nDenny Strigl: I agree.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs :  First, on pension, just sort of knowing what you know now about equity market performance this year, Doreen, can you talk us through pension plan performance and maybe help frame the 2009 earnings sensitivity for us just as it relates to pension and OPEB?  And then second question just related to Northern New England, where obviously you sold a lot of lines recently. You still have systems allocated to FairPoint. As you think through planning for sort of resource allocation and cost structure, what's your expectation for how long you have to support these systems?\nDoreen Toben: Okay, on the pension and OPEB, obviously we, you know, were similar to where the market is, although we have a lot of real estate and private equity, so our returns are probably much better than you would, you know, if you looked at the Dow or something like that. And we consistently beat benchmark.  Having said all that, on the pension fund, even if it's a very slight negative or zero, you know, you smooth it in over five years, so I don't expect it to be a big impact. The much bigger impact is in the discount rate, and so you don't really pick the discount rate until the end of the year. To the extent that interest rates move on us, you know, you can totally offset the impact. So, you know, until you really see the interest rate, it's hard to give you a number.  I mean, current course and speed, I don't expect it to be very different than it was this year. It was just like '07 and '08 are relatively flat. My expectation, short of big moves in discount rate, would be sort of similar. On the systems allocation, you want it?\nDenny Strigl: Yeah, I'm happy to take that one. On the systems support for FairPoint, Jason, we actually have a contract with FairPoint to provide systems support. I believe that that takes us into the late fall, November.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs:  Okay, so the expectation is that they move off end of November?\nDenny Strigl: Yes, sir.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.:  Doreen, on the wholesale front, do you think we're basically done with the streamlining process here? And I guess it was around a 2% impact this quarter. When do you think we'll see the financial results of that?  And then, Denny, just a related question, why do you think the enterprise - or Doreen - why do you think the enterprise has been so resilient? And obviously you have a lot of visibility into the second half, but maybe some guesstimates on why that's still holding up real well, particularly versus consumer. \nDoreen Toben: Hey, Tim, yes it - what do you mean by the wholesale 2%? I'm not sure I follow.\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.:  Oh, I'm sorry. I think you said normalized revenue growth on business would have been about 3%?\nDoreen Toben: Oh, okay. Okay. Yes, well, third quarter, we're mostly through with it. Fourth quarter we're totally through with it. So you'll see an impact that bumps up in third, but you'll see it much more significantly - although you see a nice bump in the third in the fourth quarter.  You want to do enterprise?\nDenny Strigl: Don't have anything to add to it.\nDoreen Toben: On the enterprise side, your question was why we think it's resilient this time?\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.:  Yes, yes.\nDoreen Toben: I think it's a lot more, you know, in the old days it was a lot more when you lost a person, when they had the layoffs, it was the voice or the data line to the desk. I think a lot, you know, this time it's much more all your high speed lines, your DS1s and your DS3s. And so I think that that's been a big difference. The other impact is we have a lot more global this time, right? So, you know, that can - back before we had MCI, we had no global. Now there's a significant piece of our business which is global which has been growing nicely. \nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.: And what have you done on the global front to really beef that business up, because it does look like it's doing really well.\nDenny Strigl: We've been much more focused on multinational accounts not only headquartered here in the United States but around the world, and the IP global network that we have we think is quite superior to what others offer. So that's been a big selling point for us. Once we're able to get in with the global IP network, of course we do a fair amount of consulting and some of our strategic services. So I think that's been to our advantage.\nDoreen Toben: I would say the Cybertrust acquisition, the security products, has done extremely well internationally.\nDenny Strigl: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Larsen - Credit Suisse.\nChristopher Larsen - Credit Suisse:  Doreen, you alluded to cost per FiOS installations coming down. Can you give us some parameters around that, is it, you know, now meaningful that is? And then secondly, on the Qwest business that you won, when can we start to see those Qwest subs come over, and is it your expectation that they'll begin to transfer - I think they have about 900,000 customers - will they begin to transfer those customers over to your wireless business? \nDenny Strigl: Chris, let me start this. On the Qwest deal, as customers come out of contract they will be migrating over to Verizon Wireless service. So we see that over time. It'll happen probably over the next 12 to 18 months. \nDoreen Toben: And on the FiOS piece of it, just a couple of things. Just let me do the capital for a second, you know, the big two capital metric for cost per home passed and cost per home connect, and we had given you 2010 targets of like 650 and 700. We are and we've [been saying] we are now better than our target in the cost per home passed and we are right on target, maybe a little bit better, on the cost per home connected. So on the capital side we've done extremely well. And on the expense side, which is mostly the hours in the house for the most part, they have come down nicely, so we're trending to be just about on plan. So they have been impactful.  The most impact, obviously, to the case on an ROIC, however, was the capital, of which we've done extremely well. \nRon Lataille: Stacy, at this point I'm going to hand the call over to Mr. Strigl for some closing comments.\nDenny Strigl: Thank you very much, Ron, and thanks everybody for your questions. And before we close the call, I'd like to just take a minute to summarize a couple of things that we have said in our call this morning. First, hopefully you got the sense that Doreen and I and I know Ivan, also, feels very comfortable with our business plan despite some of the concerns that others have been expressing about the economy. Although we may see some softening in some of our volumes, we do not expect any significant economic impact on our financial results in the second half of the year.  Our focus for the remainder of the year actually is pretty simple. We're intent on delivering top line growth and at the same time delivering bottom line performance and, as you heard from Doreen, we expect consolidated results to post solid mid-single digit revenue growth, steadily increasing margins, strong cash flow generation, and double-digit earnings growth. I think when we look at the first half of 2008 we're pleased with the organic momentum that we've seen across all of our operating groups in telecom. We added about 450,000 FiOS Internet customers, 439,000 FiOS TV customers, and, in fact, a week ago we added our 2 millionth FiOS Internet customer.  In Wireless we added nearly 3 million new customers and over 90% of these net adds were into our retail post-paid category. And in Verizon Business, strategic services grew 21% and global enterprise revenues before the strategic takebacks grew at 3.3%.  We've deployed capital and made investments to create this kind of organic growth, and it's converting for us into solid revenue growth.  Another area of focus, of course, is margins, especially on the Wireline side of the business. In the first six months we grew Wireline EBITDA, our margin, by 40 basis points year-over-year, and my view here is that we should be doing better. We have not yet gained enough momentum on the margin line and, as you heard today, we expect margins will continue to improve, and we continue to drive our organization to accelerate margin improvements.  But despite all of the challenges, we had double-digit earnings growth this quarter and earnings were up 14.3% yearto-date. So we're making progress. We feel good about where we are halfway through the year, and we believe that we're positioned to continue to move in the right direction. So thank you everyone for joining us today.\nRon Lataille: That concludes our call today, and thank you everyone for joining us."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-04-28 13:26:08", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President Investor Relations Denny Strigl - President and Chief Operating Officer Doreen Toben - Chief Financial Officer \nAnalysts: John Hodulik \u2013 UBS Tom Sykes - Lehman Brothers David Barden - Banc of America Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns Tim Horan - Oppenheimer Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 JP Morgan\nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon first-quarter 2008 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication, and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.  A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I\u2019d like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the first quarter.  Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.57, adjusted earnings or EPS before the effects of special items was $0.61. We are excluding the following special items from adjusted results. The first is a charge of $18 million after tax or $0.01 per share for merger integration costs. We are also excluding an $81 million after tax charge or $0.03 per share for non operational costs incurred in connection with the spin off of access lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. These costs are mostly related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. As you know, we completed the spin off on March 31st. I would also note that our first quarter and prior period financials include the results of the Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont operations. Beginning with the second quarter these operations will no longer be part of Verizon. To help investors adjust prior period results for the exclusion of these northern New England operations we will post reclassified historical information on our IR website within a few weeks. These reclassifications will only affect revenues, expenses and operating income. Earnings will be the same as previously reported. We will also adjust the appropriate volume metrics. With that I will now turn the call over to Doreen.\nDoreen Toben: Good morning everyone. Before I get into the details let me start with the comments about our results. Results for the first quarter were strong and demonstrate that we weathered the economic uncertainty. We turned in another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth with good margin expansion and double digit earnings growth. In fact, this is the fifth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in EPS from continuing operations. Our key growth areas; Wireless, FiOS, and Enterprise Strategic Services continue to drive results. Verizon Wireless had a very good quarter of customer and revenue growth. Our positive momentum in FiOS drove broadband and video revenues over $1 billion this quarter. Within Verizon Business, Strategic Services revenue growth once again was in the low to mid 20% range. Now let\u2019s get to some of the details. As you see on slide four we\u2019ve had continued revenue growth and steady margin expansion in each of the last five quarters. Consolidated revenues grew $1.2 billion or 5.5% in the first quarter. Although Wireless is still our number one growth engine our other growth drivers are also picking up scale and momentum. As I noted just a moment ago broadband and video services toped the $1 billion mark this quarter with nearly 50% growth and Verizon Business, Strategic Services revenues of $1.4 billion grew in excess of 23%.  While we sustained revenue growth in the mid single digits our operating margins have expanded each and every quarter. In the first quarter the operating income margin grew 140 basis points year over year to 18.7%. Our EBITDA margins also expanded 80 basis points year over year to 33.8%, bottom line our $0.61 of diluted EPS from continuing operations this quarter was up 13% year over year demonstrating our continued ability to translate top line growth into earnings improvement. Turning to slide five you can see our strong cash performance. In the first quarter cash flows from continuing operations grew 6.9% year over year to $5.4 billion. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows we\u2019ve continued to invest in our network and new technologies to provide the platform for growth, innovation, and productivity. Capital expenditures were flat year over year at $4.2 billion and our capital efficiency continues to improve due to our top line growth. This quarter CapEx to revenue dropped to 17.7% an improvement of 70 basis points from a year ago. Obviously the recent acquisition of 700 MHz spectrum was also a key strategic investment to strengthen our ability to capture the enormous growth potential we see for years to come in Wireless. We ended the first quarter with total debt of $35.8 billion and $5.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. This cash, along with the $4 billion of capital raised through long term borrowings in April was recently used to pay for the FCC auction 73 wireless licenses that we won. While investing for growth is critical to value creation we are also focused on returning value to our share owners. To that end we\u2019ve continued pay a very competitive dividend and also repurchase shares. During the first quarter we were opportunistic taking advantage of market conditions to repurchase one billion of our common stock. We expect to continue repurchasing shares at a more normal rate but maintain the ability to increase buy backs if warranted by market conditions. Let\u2019s look now at our segment results beginning with Verizon Wireless on slide six. We continue to see strong customer growth particularly in our retail subscriber base. Total net adds were 1.5 million of which 1.3 million were retail post-paid. Retail post-paid customers comprise nearly 93% of our total base and clearly remain the primary focus of our business. Pre-paid is still approximately 4% of the base and we added 168,000 retail pre-paid customers this quarter which is about the same as first quarter last year. As you know, only 3% of our base is not retail. Reseller net adds were 20,000 in the quarter. Our growth add performance was also strong this quarter with retail growth adds up 6.5% and total growth adds up 4.4% year over year. Churn remains very low with total churn of 1.19% and retail post-paid churn of 0.93%. Both were seasonally down sequentially as expected. Turning to revenues we sustained our record of strong double digit growth, total revenues increased to $11.7 billion in the first quarter up 13.2% over last year. Service revenue topped the $10 million mark this quarter up 12.8% year over year and 2.7% sequentially. Retail service revenue grew 13.3% year over year as retail service ARPU increased by 1.3% to $51.40. About two thirds of the growth in total service revenue is from Wireless data. In the first quarter Wireless data revenue exceeded $2.3 billion up nearly 49% over last year. Retail data ARPU increased almost $3.00 year over year to $11.94. Data now represents 23% of total service revenue up from 17.5% a year ago. More than 48 million or about 74% of our retail customers had some form of data usage in the quarter and 58% of our retail base has a broadband capable devise up from 40% a year ago. As strong as these results are we see continued momentum and excellent future growth opportunities ahead in Wireless data. As we mentioned on our Spectrum Auction conference call a few weeks ago we believe we are in a unique position to tap into the exploding data market opportunity. The acquisition of 700 MHz licenses clearly enhanced our spectrum position and we achieved all of the objectives we had going into the auction. Our first goal was to obtain nationwide clear spectrum to maximize our growth potential. We also wanted to increase the depth and breadth of our footprint particularly as it related to future capacity in key markets. As a result of our success we increased our spectrum inventory by about 60%. Across the top markets we have a total average spectrum depth of about 85 MHz. With regard to our open development initiative we held our developers conference a little over a month ago in New York. The feedback has been great with lots of interest on the part of the developer community and no shortage of unique ideas and opportunities for innovation. To say the least the combination of our global broadband networks, our enhanced spectrum position, our 4G plans with LTE and the innovation that will come from our open development initiative makes us very bullish about our future growth opportunities.  In summary, our strong Wireless performance demonstrates once again our ability to execute in a very competitive environment. We are confident in our ability to sustain double digit revenue growth; our continued dominance in the retail post-paid market is strengthening our high quality customer base and helping to drive further increases in data usage and growth. Our focus on retention and operational efficiencies has resulted in industry leading profitability. This quarter was no exception; EBITDA grew 5.7% on a sequential basis and 14.3% year over year with margins expanding to 44.9%. As the industry leader, Verizon Wireless has a long list of first in terms of products and service innovations. Most importantly we\u2019ve made all of these firsts work to our benefit in terms of growth, retention and profitability. We\u2019re feeling very good about our position to capitalize on the enormous opportunities in Wireless data for years to come. To say the least, we are very upbeat about the prospects for Wireless growth in 2008 and beyond.  Turning now to Wireline, our strategic FiOS product continued their impressive growth. In the first quarter growth in FiOS TV customers accelerated to 263,000. That\u2019s a sequential increase of 16%. We now have more than 1.2 million FiOS TV customers which is 19% penetration. Over the past year we have added more than 850,000 customers. Total broadband subscribers, DSL plus FiOS internet increased to 8.5 million up 1.1 million or 15% from a year ago and we added 266,000 broadband customers in the quarter. In FiOS internet we have just over 1.8 million subscribers representing 23% penetration. Retail residential lines declined 622,000 in the quarter compared with 616,000 last quarter and 619,000 in the first quarter a year ago. We continue to see an increasing correlation between TV availability and line retention. At the end of the quarter we were able to offer video to 82% of the 7.9 million FiOS homes open for sale expanding our Triple Play availability. Earlier this month we filed our New York City application for a video franchise covering 3.1 million homes many of which are MDUs. We already passed about 20% of these premises with Fiber so the FiOS initiative is going very well and we are gaining scale and momentum. As we move into new markets we have a great opportunity to sustain and accelerate both customer and revenue growth. In addition, our capital unit costs are trending lower as we scale and we continue to be focused on productivity. We are clearly on track to attain our goal of at least 25% FiOS TV penetration and 35% to 40% FiOS internet penetration. The consumer retail business is increasingly centered on broadband, video and bundles.  Our high growth broadband and video revenues represented almost 25% of the $3.8 billion legacy consumer revenues this quarter and were up 56% year over year. Broadband and video have also driven consumer retail ARPU to $61.02 an increase of 9.6% year over year. The average FiOS ARPU of about $129 per month is more than double the overall consumer retail ARPU. Since not everyone has all three services the Triple Play ARPU is even higher. You may recall we increased prices for selected products in the first quarter last year. We anticipate increasing prices once again on certain products and bundles in the second quarter this year.  Now let\u2019s take a Verizon Business. In this market we continue to see strong demand for strategic services which are focused on IP and data growth opportunities. Total revenues of $5.2 billion grew 0.4% year over year. As we discussed at our last earnings call first quarter revenues were impacted by some customers moving traffic off of our network. These strategic take backs resulted in a loss of one percentage point of year over year growth. We believe that the first quarter will be the low point in the year for Verizon Business revenue growth and expect to see steady improvement as we work through this loss. On the top chart on slide 12 I\u2019ve displayed our global retail enterprise revenue which is clearly our primary strategic focus. Again, the growth rates in the last two quarters reflect the effects of the strategic take backs. Strategic services now represent about 27% of total Verizon Business revenue which grew 23.5% over first quarter last year driven by private IP, managed services and security. Along with the accelerating transition to IP we\u2019re seeing a growing trend on the part of global customers to outsource their managed and professional services. We are increasing our ultra long haul capabilities and expanding our global reach to meet this continued solid demand. In summary, we are seeing continued shift to data in both the consumer and business markets as well as ongoing secular changes particularly in consumer. Total data revenues now represent almost 40% of total Wireline revenues and data growth is accelerating up 14.8% this quarter compared with last year. We are well positioned to address these secular changes as evidenced by the growing demand for our key strategic products.  We expect the customer demand for FiOS to continue as well as demand for a strategic services in the enterprise space as more customers transition to IP and look to companies like ours to manage their networks and provide data security. Similar to prior years we made investments in marketing and productivity improvement initiatives early in the year. These investments along with a full effect of the telecom pricing increases and revenue improvement in enterprise will help drive revenue growth and year over year margin expansion. We have significant opportunities to reduce costs, for example we expect operational improvements in FiOS to continue and we are very much on track to meet our goal of becoming EBITDA positive this year. As far as forced reductions are concerned we have steadily reduced Wireline headcount over the past several years. In 2007 we reduced our Wireline workforce by about 6,500 people. We expect this trend to continue with ongoing reductions planned throughout the year. We are constantly focused on reducing our access costs and we continue to work hard in the systems integration area. Overall we believe that about half of our Wireline cost structure is variable which gives us confidence in our long term outlook for Wireline margins. We remain committed to increasing Wireline EBITDA margins to the 30% to 33% range during the planning period. To wrap up our growth strategy once again drove strong results in the first quarter. We have built positive momentum in all key growth areas. Our network capabilities and the strength of our products and services position us well to continue driving growth and margin expansion. At the same time we have operational initiatives in place to reduce costs. We believe that our strong cash flows will enable us to continue investing for growth and improved productivity for years to come.  Our balance sheet is strong, we remain committed to increasing share on returns through competitive dividends and share repurchases. We are fully confident of our ability to grow the business, deliver strong operating results, and create solid long term share on returns. In short, we expect 2008 will be another year of strong operating and financial performance and with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Ron.\nRon Lataille: Operator, Doreen and Denny are now available to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: A couple questions on Wireline margins. They came in a little bit lighter than we expected and I heard the comments on sticking to the 30% to 33% over the planning period. Can you give us an idea of how you expect the margins to trend for the quarter, is this the low point in the quarter then you go up from here or is it going to bounce around here for the next couple quarters? How that relates to what we saw in \u201907, should it be sort of flattish versus \u201907 or up versus \u201907? You talked a little bit about some investments, some marketing and productivity; can you give us a little more color on what some of the spending was about here in the first quarter?\nDenny Strigl: Let me begin this one. Yes, first quarter margin was flat year over year. If you look back at the last couple of years the first quarter margins are typically lower than the third and fourth quarters and the full year average. For us, this year was no different and it\u2019s what we had expected. Although there are always some puts and takes every quarter there were no changes in the key drivers, those being FiOS, EBITDA showed good improvement, definitely some secular shifts in the core but no significant change in trend. There are some timing issues that affected revenues and margins for example in consumer the first quarter last year included $70 to $80 million of price increases. We decided to implement those price increases or similar price increases in the second quarter of this year. Also, in enterprise, Doreen and I have mentioned this before, we had some, what we call strategic take backs. They are actually some large accounts that were lost either before or just after our MCI merger.  It has taken some time for those accounts to, the revenue actually to diminish. However, we are at a high point on that now. We will see that again in the second quarter of this year and then we\u2019ll work through it. What\u2019s the outlook? Our outlook for Wireline margins hasn\u2019t changed as Doreen mentioned on her formal remarks we\u2019re committed to increasing Wireline EBITDA margins to 30% to 33% range and my operating plan this year targets 80 to 100 basis point improvement in margins. Frankly it what Ivan and I are paying our executive team to do. I\u2019m targeting margins to move from the mid 27% run rate to the low 28% range.\nDoreen Toben: On productivity, mostly I would call it blocking and tackling, it\u2019s a lot of systems work. We are really focused on reducing average handling time in the centers we\u2019ve been working on order simplification, the multi-sessions for the reps, billing simplification. We are also doing a lot on more self service trying to get more click to chat which drives our costs down. We are trying to put some things for national screening to avoid misdirected calls. I would call it a lot of blocking and tackling. On the marketing side just a lot more media spends, some of it being the TV in the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Sykes of Lehman Brothers.\nTom Sykes - Lehman Brothers: Obviously a lot of angst, when the unlimited plans were announced earlier this year. Can you share with us what you are seeing in terms of current customers moving down and up as well as anything you are seeing with respect to new customers in this category? In a related vein, can you talk to us about what data take rates are with these unlimited plans?\nDenny Strigl: I will take that question. The status of the unlimited plan is as follows; we don\u2019t typically comment on pricing results but given the controversy of the unlimited plans I\u2019d like to try to put this to rest. We\u2019re pleased with the results of our $99 unlimited plan. We\u2019re seeing good growth in high tier voice plans. We\u2019ve seen churn benefits and data growth and let me give you some specifics. Nearly 90% of our unlimited plan gross adds are single lines.  In the first quarter our unlimited plan accounted for 13% of our single line retail post-paid adds. That compares to about 4% choosing the $99 or above tiers before the plan was launched. Additionally, a high percentage of the new customers who choose an unlimited plan also choose our select or premium data packages. From a churn perspective in March which was the first full month after the launch our average daily disconnects declined 6% from previous months and that is at the voice access tier $79 and above. As expected our churn improved in the high tiers as well. At this point we\u2019re very happy with the way this plan is moving in the market for us.\nTom Sykes - Lehman Brothers: Even with some customers moving down this basically was accretive in the first quarter it was rolled out, is that correct?\nDanny Strigl: Remember there\u2019s only one month in the first quarter. It was in the first month as far as we can see, very good for us and accretive, yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Banc of America.\nDavid Barden - Banc of America: On the flip side of the Wireline margin equation you guys were at the top end of your 43% to 45% margin expectation for the quarter. If one wanted to look at it on the positive side one would say that you guys are taking great market share even at the high end of your margin band and you might go north from here. On the other side you might say that this is the low watermark for Wireline margins and that as Wireline margins drift up you might decide to bring the Wireline margins back down to take share over the balance of the year. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on that. As a second question, to tie off the year over year comparisons I remember last year changes in deprecation methodologies and things were an issue and how they affected earnings in the quarter. Could you address what, if any changes this quarter took place?\nDoreen Toben: You\u2019ve flipped between Wireless and Wireline, are you asking both?\nDavid Barden - Banc of America: More about whether the objective with Wireline margins is either to balance off Wireline margins and as Wireline margins go up we should expect Wireless margins to come down or given that you\u2019re at the high end of your Wireless margin guidance and you\u2019re taking the highest market share in the market are you comfortable now at the higher end of these levels and maybe even going north from here?\nDoreen Toben: First of all, no, we\u2019re not balancing off Wireless margins to Wireline margins; we don\u2019t do that at all. The first part of the question was no. I think we stay with our 43% to 45% guidance on Wireless margins. I\u2019m not going to go different than we\u2019ve given you on traditional metrics. What else was in that question was there anything else?\nDavid Barden - Banc of America: That was the crux of that question. The second part was on the depreciation year over year.\nDoreen Toben: On the depreciation we had a very small move in depreciation and we disclosed that in the K. No, there are really not many changes. If you look at our deprecation in aggregate in total you\u2019re not going to see much difference year over year when you go to the Verizon level so not much of a change.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: I wonder if you could drill down into broadband for us a little bit. We obviously saw continued strong FiOS results but DSL continues to soften. Maybe you can update us on the number of FiOS customers that are taking DSL now and some of your moves to upgrade the speed that side of the FiOS footprint. What do you think is driving the year over year declines, is it really an issue of saturation or market share or are we seeing some economy there as well?\nDenny Strigl: Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say about that. First DSL growth adds as you may have seen here are up sequentially this quarter 6%. Migrations to FiOS internet were up 100 basis points to 23%. Business migrations were up about 400 basis points. Excluding FiOS migrations churn has not changed. We expect this dynamic to continue. We\u2019re boosting DSL speeds, to your question to seven meg is some areas and we\u2019re also doing some additional marketing.  This is designed to help the gross adds but also we feel you can expect continued migrations to FiOS internet and migrations actually we think could accelerate. What\u2019s important is the total broadband remains strong. This quarter FiOS internet subs were up by one million year over year and DSL up about 170,000.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: No real impact from bad debts on the economy or anything like that?\nDoreen Toben: No, we\u2019re taking a look, as you know I look at daily, weekly, and monthly metrics as far as uncollectible we\u2019re not really seeing it at all. No change in trends there at all or in lines so no from the DSL and uncollectible not at all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Janazzo of Merrill Lynch.\nDavid Janazzo - Merrill Lynch: Last quarter following up on the economy, last quarter you had ticked off a number of metrics that you were monitoring across the business, can you give us an update on that?\nDoreen Toben: No, I still look at all of those metrics even more if I can get a hold of them. We are really not seeing changes in trend. Actually if you look at Wireline the uncollectible number is actually down year over year so it\u2019s much improved. Wireless has certainly stabilized. If I look at access line trends around the country trends have remained the same. As I look at all that it\u2019s the same. I would also point you to, if you look at our volume metrics, we had very strong Wireless net adds, the FiOS net adds were really strong.  Verizon Business funnel remains strong, ARPU was up both in consumer and Wireline and Wireless data revenues were up, the broadband video increased. Right now, although I\u2019m continuing to monitor, but as I\u2019m looking at this I\u2019m really not seeing any change in trends and no concerns at this time.\nDavid Janazzo - Merrill Lynch: You had mentioned a correlation between FiOS and access line losses and I\u2019ve heard you give statistics on that before, can you give us an update, the latest thinking on that?\nDoreen Toben: It continues to get stronger and stronger. I\u2019ve mentioned a couple times that I look at those essential offices or areas in every single one of the states where we have FiOS video for over six months. There is an incredible correlation at a minimum of 250 basis points many areas much higher 500, 700, 1,000 basis points. In those areas that have both data and video over six months, the correlation continues very strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup: I was wondering if you could talk about how diluted FiOS is to the EBITDA and EBITDA margin currently and what are your plans to break even on that basis?\nDoreen Toben: Right now I would say that it\u2019s really on tract to the EBITDA positive so we feel really good about the numbers. We feel really good about all the capital and expense metrics that we\u2019re seeing capital is probably better than I expected all the expense metrics on hours and what not actually better than planned. At this point FiOS is really not diluting on a sequential basis the EBITDA so you\u2019re not seeing, that is not a cause of the sequential decline at all. Expect it to be positive by the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Bear Stearns.\nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: A couple things, first on the Verizon Business side can you guys give us an update on where you stand on the margin improvement opportunity there and also maybe just comment on the competitive dynamic? Secondly, you mentioned that there\u2019s a possibility for pricing increases in 2Q on FiOS product. Can you give us a sense for how you guys feel comfortable doing that as far as the competitive dynamics whether it\u2019s the cable pricing or demand on your side?\nDenny Strigl: Let me begin this question. Overall for Verizon Business feeling very good about the competitive strengths we have in the marketplace. Unsurpassed global network capability, some solid sales and service teams in place with global reach and scale. Broad product portfolio led by IP capabilities both MPLS private line IP, security services and Ethernet portfolio and coverage. I think we\u2019re in very, very good shape against the competition. Maybe what\u2019s selling for us.  We\u2019re seeing increased opportunities with large complex deals as more enterprises look to outsource and consolidate to one vendor. We\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised over the last couple of quarters in that regard. We\u2019re also selling IP network services and that\u2019s actually driven by growing data communications requirements, security services let by cyber trust offerings going well for us. Managed service for LAN, WAN and other devices looking good for us. One of the questions you all have asked us in the past concerns competitive pricing pressures and the market continues to be competitive but we think Verizon has benefited from consolidation and weakness in some of the other competitors. Pricing will always be competitive but we continue to focus on value. The write down activity has been stable and first quarter \u201908 pretty much in line with first quarter of \u201907.\nDoreen Toben: On the margin side for Verizon Business we\u2019ve made great progress so that\u2019s been on plan. I would point to one thing and I think you\u2019ve heard us talk to it before. The fact the large strategic revenues that we lost from one or two particular customers actually had very good margins. That was part of the sequential decline in margins was really driven out of a particular contract or two from that standpoint. What was your FiOS question was it on pricing?\nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: The price increase, how you\u2019re comfortable doing that, whether or not the cable pricing is that wide of a disparity and just thoughts generally.\nDoreen Toben: Yes, I think you\u2019ll see us move up pricing probably end of this quarter, early next quarter. Obviously we think it\u2019s a superior product, we think we\u2019ve had great sales, we\u2019re very comfortable moving up the pricing at this point.\nMike McCormack - Bear Stearns: Are you seeing a disparity between the competitive pricing of where you guys are?\nDoreen Toben: No, I think that we\u2019re actually pretty close. Everybody still has that $99 bundle. Then there\u2019s a little bit of a tax issue with us. I did disclose in the script sort of for the first time the $129 ARPU which I think is not the Triple Play, that\u2019s the average which if you were to assume that\u2019s an average not everybody has the Triple Play that is the ARPU for the Triple Play of course is much higher than that. I think that\u2019s a pretty impressive number as I at least look at the competitors.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: Two clarifications and then a follow up. Is this take rate a pretty good run rate do you think, I might have missed this in your commentary and then maybe an update on where you are with your FiOS penetration in your most mature markets at this point?\nDoreen Toben: On the tax rate actually we had given guidance of 35% to 37% I would probably tell you I might move that guidance down to 35% to 36%. I am actually looking, there are some issues that are under tax investigation and so we may have something settled next quarter which will in fact bring the rate lower for the second quarter. I would use a 35% to 36% as opposed to the 35% to 37%. On the penetration question you had as far as FiOS was what?\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: In your most mature markets the ones you\u2019ve been in for more than two years where you are at now?\nDoreen Toben: I guess in TV I would say we\u2019re certainly well over 25, we\u2019ve got some with a four in front of it then we\u2019ve got several with threes in front of it so very strong. I would say on internet I think almost everybody has at least a two in front of it and many of them have a three in front of it. I would say some in the 40s which is at the high end then mostly in the 20s.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: In your comments you said in five quarters of double digit earnings growth and you\u2019re not seeing big impact yet from the economy. Any reason that can\u2019t continue, if I\u2019m looking at the trends here in Wireless it does seem like the margins continue to expand there and you talk about Wireline margins expanding. The tax rate being stable, depreciation being stable, doing stock buy backs, it looks like the double digit can continue for a while maybe absent the economy really slowing.\nDoreen Toben: We don\u2019t give quarter specific guidance. We\u2019ve certainly given business plan guidance so over the plan we\u2019re certainly comfortable with double digits. I don\u2019t disagree with certainly Wireless continues to go well, Wireline, Denny gave you some guidance as to where we think it will go. I\u2019m not going to give you specific quarterly guidance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Larsen of Credit Suisse.\nChris Larsen - Credit Suisse: The first is just a clarification, on the price increases on the FiOS side is that an indication you\u2019re going to increase the $99 bundle or are those components in there? Secondly, you had the incremental margin pressure in this first quarter some of it came from the FiOS TV offer where you got the free TV, can you give us a quantification of maybe what we might see trend back? There was some talk of constraints in whether the installers or A/C boxes can you give us an update on where you are there and how you are doing on installations of FiOS?\nDoreen Toben: On the price increases I think we will keep the $99 price. What we are doing is whether it\u2019s set top boxes or its premium channels or miscellaneous so I think the $99 bundle will stay because that\u2019s where everybody else is so you\u2019ll see in different spots there. As far as giving you a specific number on the TVs I won\u2019t do that. I will tell you that marketing expenses will probably trend somewhat down from where they were in the first quarter.\nDenny Strigl: We\u2019re pretty much caught up on the HD boxes; the production is in good shape at this point. There are still some that we are replacing that had been in the field and sold early on, pretty much through the problem all together.\nChris Larsen - Credit Suisse: If I could ask one more, there\u2019s some talk that you could capitalize the interest expense in the spectrum have you made a final determination on that? If you do decide to capitalize it how long can you capitalize it, is it until you deploy the 700 MHz spectrum?\nDoreen Toben: The answer is yes, you would capitalize it until you deploy it. At current course and speed I anticipate that we will capitalize most of it. However, I\u2019m not going to get out in front of my accountants in that we need E&Y and Deloitte to both sign off on the plan that we put together. Until that that\u2019s really signed off by them other than the intent is to capitalize most of it. When I get that all done I\u2019ll let you know. You should think about it that way.\nChris Larsen - Credit Suisse: That would be amortized over the 40 year period of the spectrum?\nDoreen Toben: I guess I\u2019m not going to go through that until I get the final from the accountants.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: First regarding the recent access line sale in northern New England lost of nuances you saw there at the public utility commission level. I\u2019m just wondering as you look forward does this change the appetite at all for further access line sales in your base. Second, in Wireless talking about LTE here can you give us any granularity around the cost to roll that out?\nDenny Strigl: Let me start with the access line piece and we\u2019re very pleased that we finally got into conclusion in New England with FairPoint. We think overall a good deal for both parties relative to looking at other access lines. I think it\u2019s important to say we always look at possibilities but nothing planned at the present.\nDoreen Toben: LTE as far as looking at the planning period it\u2019s really less than EVDO was so this is not something that we see as a big increase of the capital budget.\nOperator: Jonathan Chaplin of JP Morgan\nJonathan Chaplin \u2013 JP Morgan: A quick follow up on the Wireline margins, I\u2019m wondering if any of the normalizing items that you took in the quarter for Puerto Rico and for merger related expenses would have been captured in Wireline. If so, it seems like most of them probably were attributable to Wireline actually, in which case the margins would have been more, I think in the 28% range. Just looking at the sequential pressure, I understand that the large enterprise contracts or wholesale contracts, the move to where there are very high margin revenues, is there anything else besides the enterprise contracts would have accounted for the margin pressure, or is that just about all of it?\nDoreen Toben: First of all, no, there is no PRTC or Dominican or anything in the Wireline margins, so Wireline is Wireline. I guess if you were to take, I'm not sure how helpful this is, if you were to take out some of the M&A normalization out of the Qs, you would see less of a sequential decline from fourth quarter to first quarter, if that was sort of your question. Then I think a lot of it I really talked about in the prepared remarks, which was we have got some marketing costs that were very heavy in the first quarter. You know some other mostly marketing in some of the Verizon Business contracts that were the first quarter pressure.\nRon Lataille: Operator, that\u2019s our last question for the day and I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us and we\u2019ll see you again next quarter."}], "2010": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2009, "date": "2010-01-26 15:48:07", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President Ivan G.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. (Operator's Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Killian our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication, and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a reply you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. Next I'd like to cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings this quarter. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.23. Adjusted earnings before the effects of special items were $0.54 per share. The differences between reported and adjusted earnings this quarter were due to the following special items; the first one is a $3 billion pretax charge for severance and pension and benefit settlement and curtailment costs related to our force reduction program. On an after-tax basis, this equates to about $1.9 billion or $0.66 per share. About $950 million of the pretax charge is for additions to severance reserves. The remaining charges of approximately $2.1 billion pretax are related to pension settlement losses resulting from lump sum distributions during the quarter and curtailment costs related to the large number of employee separations. The second item is an after-tax charge of $127 million or $0.02 per share for merger integration costs relating to Alltel. We are also excluding $246 million after tax or $0.09 per share in non-operational charges. These costs are related to our wireline cost reduction initiatives as well as costs in connection with our ongoing efforts to spin-off our local exchange business in 14 states. These costs are related to network, software, and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. With that I will now turn the call over to John Killian.\nJohn Killian: Thanks, Ron, and good morning to everyone. Let me start with a quick look at our fourth quarter highlights on Slide 3. We've had strong cash flow growth all year long and our fourth quarter was no exception. Cash flow from operations was up 10.8% compared with the year ago quarter, demonstrating our continued focus on operating and capital discipline. We made good progress this quarter in all of our key strategic areas. In wireless, we delivered a strong quarter of subscriber growth with total net adds of 2.2 million, 1.2 million of which were retail and primarily postpaid and 1 million from resellers. Wireless data revenues were up more than 26% and the wireless team is successfully integrating the Alltel properties, which will help growth in 2010.\n : So we ended the year with continued progress on the key areas, operating with good financial discipline, but still facing a very challenging economic environment. Before we get to the operational results and trends, let's first review consolidated earnings and cash flow. As Ron indicated earlier, we generated $0.54 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year result to $2.40 per share, which was down 5.5% or $0.14 below 2008.  Our financial objectives at this time last year were focused on growing earnings in the face of some tough cyclical, secular, and pension related headwinds, and just as important, increasing free cash flow by tightly managing our costs in the capital program and returning cash to shareholders.  From an earnings perspective, and this became more evident in the second half of the year, the prolonged effects of the economic downturn coupled with the incremental $0.11 per share pension and retiree benefit impact, were too large to be fully offset by growth in our key areas and the productivity improvements we achieved during the year. However, many of these earning pressures were non-cash related, so our cash generation was even stronger than we anticipated.  Let's take a closer look at cash flow on Slide 5. So from a cash flow perspective, we had a very good year. As you know, our Board of Directors raised the dividend in September by 3.3%, cash flow from operations grew by $4 billion or 14.5% in 2009 led by strong cash generation in wireless. And free cash flow of $14.5 billion was significantly higher than last year, up $4.2 billion or 40.7%. As I said earlier, 2009 capital expenditures, which included incremental spending related to our Alltel acquisition was $17 billion. So in spite of the addition of Alltel, we were down about $200 million year over year. In addition to returning cash to shareholders in the form of $5.3 billion in dividend payments in 2009, we also utilized cash to reduce debt. On a consolidated basis, net debt at the end of the year was $60.2 billion, down $4.4 billion since the end of January, which was right after we completed the financing to acquire Alltel. We ended the year with net debt to EBITDA of about 1.7 times. Let's take a closer look at the revenue trends starting on Slide 6. In spite of difficult economic conditions, 2009 consolidated revenues grew 1.5% compared with 2008 on a pro forma basis. Similar to the trends we've seen throughout 2009, top-line results were mixed. All of our strategic areas continued to post good growth, particularly wireless data in FIOS, but cyclical weakness in the business markets continued primarily in volume-driven voice products. Let's move to the segments next, starting with wireless on Slide 7. Our wireless business continued to deliver strong performance this quarter. Total operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $15.7 billion, up 3.1% on a pro forma basis over the fourth quarter last year. Total service revenues grew 5% in the fourth quarter. As we have seen all year, service revenue growth is driven by wireless data, which represented about 32% of total service revenues in the quarter. As I highlighted earlier, we had a great quarter in terms of subscriber growth with 2.2 million net adds. In 2009, we added approximately 6 million new customers, so we ended the year with 91.2 million customers, an increase of 7%. Let's take a closer look now at what's driving data revenue and ARPU growth on Slide 8. Data revenue is now in excess of $16 billion annually, that's up 31% from 2009. Total data ARPU was over $16 in the fourth quarter which was 18.7% higher year-over-year. This explosive growth is being driven by increasing mobile broadband adoption with the proliferation of innovative new devices like smart phones and netbooks as well as new data applications on these devices. Text messaging which makes up about 40% of data revenue is still showing good growth, up 21% on the quarter. Revenues from non-messaging services, which make up the other 60% of data revenue increased above 31% in the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 8, revenue from web and email services has grown to over $2 billion per quarter, up 47% from a year ago. We believe there are significant opportunities to continue to grow data revenue. We have a strong and growing smart phone portfolio that is meeting the increased customer demand for high speed, high capability devices that can support a large number of applications. Our Droid franchise is a good example. We were very pleased with the sales of our new smart phones this quarter, the Motorola Droid, the HTC Droid Eris and the Blackberry Storm 2 all posted strong sales. As you know, we have simplified our devices into three categories; 3G smart phones, 3G multimedia devices, and simple feature phones. At the end of 2009, 26% of our retail postpaid base had 3G multimedia devices or smart phones. 15% were smart phones and 11% were multimedia devices. All of these devices now require a data plan. 3G smart phones have a requirement for a $30 plan and 3G multimedia devices have a $10 minimum plan requirement. So looking ahead, we see plenty of data growth opportunities driven by new and enhanced devices and innovative applications and content, all powered by Verizon's expansive 3G network today and our new 4G network later this year. As we think about 4G and encourage innovation through our open development initiative, it is becoming clear that the business is expanding to include opportunities in both the retail and wholesale markets. However, retail continues to be our primary focus and represents the largest portion of our wireless business. 96% of our total customer base is retail and 82.2 million or 90% of the base are retail postpaid subscribers. In the fourth quarter, we added 1.2 million retail customers, 67,000 were prepaid and the rest were postpaid.  Retail service revenue of $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter grew 5.2% year over year. Retail postpaid ARPU of $52.40 was stable with 0.2% year over year growth and our customer retention metrics remained very strong. Retail postpaid churn of 1.06% improved by four basis points year over year on a pro forma basis as did total churn of 1.42%.\n : Let's move now to our wireline segment on Slide 11.  In our wireline business we continue to see a transformation of the consumer market from voice to broadband connectivity, and within our business markets we're seeing continued economic pressures. Our FiOS initiative is gaining scale, now covering about half of our households. At the end of 2009, we had nearly 3 million FiOS TV customers and over 3 million FiOS Internet subscribers. Including DSL, we have more than 9.2 million broadband customers. Our penetration metrics are on target and total broadband and video revenues exceeded $6 billion in 2009 and grew 25.5% in the fourth quarter. Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 12. The strength of our broadband and video products continues to drive consumer revenue and ARPU growth. Consumer revenue grew 1.2% on a year over year basis and we're seeing strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to just over $77 this quarter, up 12.6% from a year ago. FiOS' ARPU remains very strong at more than $140 per month. Consumer revenue from our broadband and video services totaled $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, up 28.6% year over year. Revenue from these services was about 40% of total consumer revenue in the quarter, up from 31% a year ago. FiOS consumer broadband and video revenue totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 52.2% from a year ago. During the quarter, net adds for TV and Internet both totaled 153,000. Our full year additions in 2009 were roughly the same as 2008, so we maintain good momentum. Our churn levels are low and we have excellent customer satisfaction ratings. Slide 13 shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance.  As I said earlier, we continue to see economic pressures affecting both the business retail and wholesale markets. High levels of unemployment continue to impact usage volumes and we are not seeing any significant pickup yet in capital or IT spending by our largest customers. We're encouraged by the continued growth in quarterly revenue from strategic services, which grew 6% year over year and about 3% sequentially led by sales of IP data services.  Global enterprise revenue declined 4.5% in the fourth quarter as compared with a 5.3% decline in the third. However, adjusting for the impact of foreign currency effects, revenue growth declined 5.4% year over year and about $125 million sequentially. Fourth quarter CPE sales were down about 9% year over year, further indicating weakness in IT spending. Global wholesale revenue also declined 4.5% in the fourth quarter. We are seeing growth in Ethernet services related to wireless backhaul and in migration of traditional data services to IP, but usage volumes continue to be down 4% to 4.5%. We continue to believe that the primary leading indicator for sustained improvement in the business market will be a return to hiring on the part of large enterprise businesses. So we're holding our own with existing customers and remaining competitive when it comes to new business; the signs of recovery are slow. Let's talk about the wireline profitability picture. As shown on Slide 14, wireline EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter declined 70 basis points sequentially to 23%. There are three conditions that we're working very hard to offset; temporary economic pressures, ongoing secular changes and incremental pension and benefits expense. I can assure you that we have a strong focus on our cost structure and we've taken several actions that will help us in 2010. We reduced our wireline related force by 13,000 people or about 9% in 2009. About 5,000 of these employees came off the payroll late in the fourth quarter and we expect a similar level of annual force reductions in 2010. Along with these force reductions we're also looking at a number of initiatives to simplify our wireline operations and drive costs out of the business. For example, we're working on a comprehensive redesign of our entire call center infrastructure, which will reduce the number of call centers and improve our utilization and efficiency metrics. Another example is a wireline network consolidation initiative that will result in operating efficiency improvements. We believe that a combination of better revenue performance and improving economy, the effect of our ongoing force reductions, and our ability to achieve some of these other cost reduction opportunities, will help improve margins over time. We're also focused on our capital spending. Wireline CapEx was down $905 million or 9.2% year over year.  Before we get to your questions I'd like to provide some additional details on our 2010 outlook and our key focus areas which are on Slide 15. In wireless we will continue to focus on growing revenue and market share, expanding data penetration and growing data revenue, developing LTE and offering 4G services in 25 to 30 markets before year-end, and capitalizing on the successful integration of Alltel. Lastly, we will also remain disciplined in balancing our growth initiatives and profitability. In wireline, we will continue to capitalize on our investments in FiOS and our global IP network by driving higher FiOS penetration and growing ARPU and revenue, and by increasing our market share in professional and managed enterprise services and growing strategic services revenue. As I said earlier, we will remain focused on our cost structure and achieve meaningful cost reductions and we will make sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in employment and the overall economy.  We have taken steps in both our wireless and wireline segments to strengthen the business going forward. We continue to expect solid cash flow generation in 2010. Our capital spending in 2010 is targeted to be in the range of $16.8-$17.2 billion. We expect wireless CapEx to be modestly higher year over year, reflecting increased demand for smart phones and higher data usage, and we expect wireline CapEx to continue to decline, so we'll have flexibility to allocate capital dollars between the segments. In addition to the capital spending I just described, we will use cash to pay down debt. I'm targeting to reach a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 to1.5 times by year end. I do not anticipate any share repurchasing activity at this time, and of course I expect we will maintain a competitive dividend.  Consistent with previous years, I won't give specific earnings guidance, however, there are a few items I would highlight. There will be approximately $0.04to $0.06 of incremental pressure on EPS due to non-cash pension and retiree benefit costing 2010 which is down from the year-over-year impacting 2009. And the annual effective tax rate attributable to Verizon is expected to be in the range of 33% to 35%. Finally, as we report results in 2010, we will no longer adjust reported earnings results, instead only reporting GAAP earnings, consistent with trends in corporate reporting. By eliminating adjusted results, we will simplify our financial reporting. Of course, we will continue to provide the detailed information you need to understand and analyze our reported results, including the identification of material nonoperational items. For example, as we approach completion of the strategic transactions we initiated in 2009, we will fully disclose any related costs and the impact of divesting properties in our financial results. And with that I'd like to turn it back to Ron.\nRon Lataille: Thank you, John. Ivan and John are now available to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator's Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Okay, thanks. Good morning, guys. In the past you guys have given targets for wireless margins and could you maybe update us or do you think it's possible to hold profitability at this level given the increasing number of upgrades and the higher end phones and what seems to be more competition in the industry recently? And then a quick follow-up to that, there was more strength than we expected in the reseller channel, how do you expect that to evolve as we move throughout the year? Do you expect it to grow from here or is that becoming an increasing focus just based on how the markets' evolving?\nJohn Killian: Sure. Good morning, John. It's John Killian, thank you. Yeah, we're very pleased with our wireless margin performance as we look at '09. For the full year, we were 45.9, just short of 46%, fourth quarter we came at 45%. As you know we don't provide specific point guidance here, but we really had a very strong year. The fourth quarter at 45% did see the impact of a very heavy level of upgrade activity and as you can see in our numbers, very strong growth in the fourth quarter. We had the series of new smart phones introduced in early November, so the Droid, the Eris, they have been extremely well received and in particular a strong take-up in the fourth quarter so that was some of the impact we saw there. We think we're very well positioned in the wireless business in 2010. We have the right handset lineup, we're getting more and more data penetration, very good data growth, so our focus is, as it has been in the past, both driving growth and profitability. We won't put out a specific target, but we feel very good about our position and our ability to continue to drive industry-leading margins in the wireless business. On the reseller side, you are right, very good performance in the fourth quarter. We added a million new reseller customers as we mentioned. Now a point of interest here, this comes from several different resellers contributed to this, it just wasn't one party. The other point I would make is that the new resellers that are coming in are coming in at much higher ARPU levels than the traditional reseller base we had in the past. So we also see this as an opportunity to expand the marketplace. We haven't changed our strategy, our strategy is still very much focused on the postpaid base and the retail base, but that doesn't mean we're not going to participate in other segments of the markets where we can drive positive NPVs for our shareholders and that's how we see the reseller market right now.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Great. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Thanks a lot. Good morning. John, could you give us an update on the Alltel synergies, what we've had so far and what we can expect going into 2010? And on the FiOS adds, the numbers were a little bit lower than we'd expected, sort of second quarter in the below 200,000. Is this sort of a sign of maturity perhaps or is it more seasonal or is this sort of the run rate we should be thinking about into 2010? Thanks.\nJohn Killian: Okay. Thanks, Simon. On Alltel, very pleased with the progress we made in 2009. We are through all of the billing system conversions for the former Alltel so they're all now on our billing areas. Our target for the year was $500 million to $600 million in expense synergies. We actually did a little bit better than that. Our target for full year 2010 is $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We're well on path for that. We're not fully done with all of the integration work. The integration work remaining in '10 is more around network. We got a lot of network integration work done in '09, but we have more cell site conversions to be done and we'll be working on that. So we feel very good. We spent a little bit more on the CapEx side in '09 on Alltel integration than we had originally anticipated, but the aggregate amount we will spend will be the same so there'll be a little bit of a benefit, less spending in '10 as we go through there. So I think Alltel has turned out to be very positive for us and we expect it to continue to be positive. From a FiOS perspective, Simon, we're pleased with our overall FiOS performance and as we look back on the last several years we continue to see expanded penetration, a very good ARPU as we pointed out, over $140, really strong video ARPUs, and great reaction to the product. Churn is running low and continues to run low and we've also seen, as we expected to do, continuation in improving our operational metrics in the fiber network running with much lower maintenance costs than the copper network.  Now when you think about growth two years in a row, we've gained over 900,000. Over those two years, we've had fluctuations quarter by quarter. It hasn't been an exactly linear climb up, so we feel very good that there still is a lot of opportunity to expand penetration. We will have new homes being opened for sale also, so we feel good about our position here. Fourth quarter, I think there was a little bit of an impact from the economy, from consumer spending, but we think as we continue to enhance the product, we're very well positioned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nVijay Jayant - Barclays Capital:  Thank you. I have a question for Ivan, really a bigger picture question. In 2010, obviously you have some strategic sales and some pension related pressure on your earnings, so can you actually talk about the true organic growth you could drive in the business both in terms of earnings and cash flow in 2010 and how is that going to be driven? And beyond 2010 can you sort of talk about the sustainability of dividends given most of the free cash flows coming from wireless? Thank you.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: Yeah. Okay, Vijay. Thank you. So it's a good question and it's something we've discussed here. Generally when we turn the clock back a year and look at the beginning of 2009, we assume that we would get a little bit more momentum from the economy and we were comfortable that a lot of our organic plans would pickup momentum. So here we are at the beginning of 2010. We feel that our organic momentum is good. We had good growth in all our strategic areas as John pointed out a minute ago, but we're facing some more significant headwinds than we thought we would face from the economy. So to answer your question, when we look at 2010, this is kind of the way our management team put the year together. We have a lot of confidence that we can continue to drive success in our organic areas. John mentioned just now on FiOS, we feel we have a good formula in wireless, and so I think that we feel we're in pretty good shape in that score. The economy won't help us as much as we thought so the truth of the matter is from an organic standpoint, we're shooting for some modest organic growth as you look at our core business going into 2010. Now when you wrap that around the broader question you ask about shareholder returns, I think our strong suit in 2010 is obviously going to be the excellence of our operations and the generation of cash. So we'll be able to continue to de-lever, our credit metrics will improve, our balance sheet will get better, we'll be able to focus on maintaining a very strong and competitive dividend. As you mentioned, there's two transactions that will be completed and particularly the frontier one will offer investors an opportunity for some added value creation.  So when you add this all up, we're looking at the possibility here in 2010 that we can drive total returns, total shareowner value in terms of what shareholders can expect somewhere in the high single digits. That's kind of our view of how the year could pan out. There\u2019s some risk to that. There's also some upside. The economy could be an upside, but our view this year is we have sort of discounted a lot of help from the economy, because in my view in talking to other companies and our work on the business roundtable, even if the economy starts to pick up, it won't be until maybe the end of the year, which won't have a big material impact on 2010. So Vijay, I hope that answers the question. Now one more point, we feel much more bullish about 2011 because in 2011 I think we will have furthered our positions in a lot of the areas we're working on organically and there should be clearly some impact and positive impact on the economy as we go forward. So we're thinking this is a year where we do better than we did in '09 and '11 should be even a stronger year after that.\nVijay Jayant - Barclays Capital:  Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question if I could ask just two. The first one on wireless, I guess notwithstanding the expectations of organic growth in the key strategic areas, I guess in the fourth quarter for instance, service revenue and wireless, and I know this is not a sequential business, but it was up about 20 basis points. That's the lowest sequential revenue growth over the last five years we've seen by as much as 100 basis points. And John, I go back to some of your comments from the introduction of the new pricing plans where we were expecting voice pressure to kind of be the first thing felt and then data upside later. So I guess as we look into a tougher year from a net add growth standpoint, are we maybe at the point where we're going to start to see some more volatility and possible negative wireless services revenue growth here? And if not, I'd love to hear the argument there. And then the second piece is just if I could go back to the FiOS side of things, obviously third quarter, the target was kind of a 250 run rate, we showed up in the fourth quarter with 150, last quarter you were very aggressive on promotions. You've reversed out of those promotions, you've raised prices for FiOS and some of the low-end DSL stuff, so it feels like as you focus on profitability, you're willing to sacrifice market share in the near term. And also I'd love to hear your thoughts on that, thanks.\nJohn Killian: Yeah. Okay, Dave. We have a couple of thoughts here for you. Yeah, we have seen a deceleration in wireless service revenue growth as we've gone through the year. As we went through the year though we saw a pretty good pickup as we went through the third and fourth quarter and continued strong pickup on net adds on the retail postpaid side and you also saw the positive impact on the reseller side.  When you look at ARPU here, and particularly the one I focus more on is postpaid ARPU, so we continue to grow, growth slowed down a little bit, got 2% growth as we went through the fourth quarter. The voice side, the rate of decline was about the same level in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter, but we continue to see very strong growth on the data side. So I think as we look to 2010, we think we can accelerate growth on data. A little bit we're competing in a disadvantaged position through the early part of '09 in terms of our smart phone lineup. We think we've done a lot to fix that. The Droid has been extremely well received. As you know we have additional new smart phones being rolled out, in January, the Palm product in particular.  So our handset lineup is very strong, our data attachment rate is very strong. We're seeing a much higher penetration of both smart phones and multimedia phones. In the script, we mentioned about 26% of our base at the end of '09 comes from either a smart phone or a multimedia. If you look at our fourth quarter direct sales, it was a factor of 2.5 times that in terms of mix, so we're going to be getting a much higher ARPU customer coming through, and I think we'll see more of the benefits there as we go through in 2010. The tradeoff of growth and profitability, as I mentioned to you on FiOS, we feel we're in a very good position on the FiOS side. We are also focused on driving strong margins. As you know, content costs go up, other kinds of factors, so we're not going to stand still from a price perspective, but you are right, we have changed our promotions in the first quarter. We've gone away from the $150 cash back. That wasn't because of pressure on profitability, it really was on driving market reaction to our proposition. So now we're leading with an $89 offer that's bringing traffic in, and then we have significant opportunity to up-sell.  So if you look at our FiOS platform, we think we're extremely well positioned. All of the consumer reports are rating it very highly. Our customer reaction to the product is very positive, so we think we can continue to improve the profitability of the FiOS offering and at the same time continue to sustain growth. We don\u2019t' think every quarter is going to be exactly like you need to react pretty quickly to different competitor offerings, but we feel good about our FiOS position.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thanks for the color, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research: Hi, good morning. Shifting back over to the wireline margin, can you help us a little bit more in terms of timing? Maybe if we just stripped pension out for a moment and think about the wireline margin on a cash basis, how would you think about the recovery in terms of the pace of the headcount reductions that you\u2019ve done to date and your planning? And then if you could also overlay that with how you\u2019re looking at FiOS economics improving for 2010? Thanks.\nJohn Killian: Yeah. Hey, Mike. It's John. I think we had three factors in particular that are impacting the wireline margins and particularly in '09 and we're going to live with some of this as we go through 2010. I think the biggest factor in '09 as we look back really is the economy. If you look at our enterprise business and our wholesale business, both of them were down 4%-5% range in the fourth quarter, earlier in the year the wholesale business was down a little bit more than that. So the economy, particularly in those areas, had a significant impact on the ability to sustain and hold margins as we lost some of that, and particularly in the wholesale side, some of that higher margin revenue. We've also got the issues with shifts from the secular side with some of our traffic moving to the wireless side, so we're dealing with the secular pressures that we've been dealing with, and as you mentioned, another big factor last year was pension and benefit. So our focus has been to do a couple of different things, but at the lead of this is to take a lot of costs out of the business. Now if you look back in '09, our force reductions were much more backend loaded, so wireline business in total we reduced about 13,000. We reduced the total workforce by about 17,000, about 4,000 of that was related to Alltel integration so the pure wireline, but it was much more backend loaded. So we didn't see as much of the benefit of that in '09 as we would have liked to have seen. We will see benefit of that in 2010. And then you can also see in the results that we also provided for further force reductions in 2010 and you should think about that at about the same level that we did in 2009. So our team will be extremely focused on right sizing the cost structure. There's a series of other areas where we will be attacking, things like real estate or reducing square footage. As we bring the employee base down, we have excess facilities within the system, so we will go through a process of terminating some leases, we'll sell some additional buildings. And you can just get a feeling that virtually every expense line will have a lot of pressure on it. Now we also look at expanding penetration in the marketplace so it isn't just cost. As mentioned earlier, we just did a couple of price changes on FiOS. We don't think they're going to inhibit our ability to grow, but we think they're going to allow us to drive more margin from a FiOS perspective. Now FiOS you mentioned, FiOS is performing pretty much where we thought it would be. We continue to see improving profitability as we go further through the investment. We think that will continue to accelerate as we go through 2010. It's not exactly like the original business case we laid out. Some pieces of FiOS have done better than others, but we're pleased with our FiOS performance.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs:  Hey, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions maybe first on wireless. A good quarter in postpaid relative to I think what we expect from the rest of the industry. Much of what you did in the quarter in terms of the ad campaigns was directed at AT&T in particular. I'm wondering if you can sort of speak to porting ratios in the quarter in terms of where the strength came from? Was it AT&T and sort of mapped out the ad campaigns or was it sort of broader strength, if you can speak to that? And then second question, I guess just getting back to FiOS, I know you said churn remains low, I'm wondering If you can give us any more granularity to help us think about sort of the gross add, churn, net add picture as we went through 4Q? Thanks.\nJohn Killian: Okay. Yeah, Jason. On porting, we did see improvement in the fourth quarter on porting overall. We don't give specifics on carrier by carrier, but we're pleased with our performance there. We were definitely at a disadvantage on the higher end of the market with our smart phone lineup. The introduction of the Droid and other products helped us a lot there, so we're pleased with our performance from a net add perspective, and we see that opportunity to continue on the porting side as we go into 2010. Churn is running both on the video and data product in the low ones in absolute terms and it has improved a little bit, but stayed very steady despite a very competitive market on FiOS internet and the TV side. We think a lot of that has to do with the quality of the offer that we have, the product that we have and the enhancements that you can see through the advertising that we continue to make. So, links to things like Facebook and Twitter and continuing to add added value that isn't available through a lot of the competitor offerings. So by strengthening the quality of the product, it's having very positive impacts on churn.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs:  And so with churn kind of where it is you guys are obviously managing the gross add channel around FiOS, can we maybe talk about the conceptual framework? I know we've had a couple of questions on profitability at FiOS, but just conceptually there's sort of a couple of different paths that relate to profitable growth and FiOS and one argument would be scale the business as quickly as possible to gain leverage over content costs which could be the bigger issue over time. The other path would be worry about install costs right now. Can you help us think sort of conceptually about that over the next couple of years?\nIvan G. Seidenberg: Yeah, Ivan here, Jason. I think if you look at this from an operational standpoint, or as you might say, conceptual, we think we've learned a lot in watching the evolution of the FiOS. So let's start out with what John said, which is we get really good, terrific grounding with our customers. Now for the past two or three years, we have these big events in which we opened a lot of homes for sale, which generate as point of pressure in the marketplace where we do a lot of promotions, our competitors do a lot of promotions, and we get some footing in the marketplace. Now what we've found is given that we're out there a long time and we've watched a behavior that once offices are open for two or three years, we've seen a very steady improvement in penetration that we're very satisfied with. And so we have discovered the idea that if we focus a little bit better, we're going to get the market without having to necessarily overheat the market at any point in time. So I think where we are now is we naturally have to experiment with a couple of things, but what's maturing is the fact we're nearing our full plate of passing homes and so you just don't market now the same way you might have marketed when you first opened it. So I think we're more conscious about the fact we're confident we'll get the market. We have to make sure we're careful about profitability.  Now I would also say this. FiOS is doing fine. The other point I'd make is I'm not happy about the fact the economy has slowed down the improvement and the earnings on the business side. So the issue is when we look at the whole wireline segment, we do need to balance a little bit of profitability to make sure that where the economy is hurting us that we offset some of that by not being too aggressive on the FiOS side, so it's a timing question. So the way I'd ask you to think about this is, we think we're going to get the market. We'll just time it a little bit different. We'll try to do it a little bit better, hold our own on the business side. And as John said, the glue that sort of helps us here is a fairly aggressive focus on our cost structure. So maybe that's a way that we're thinking about the evolution of the wireline sector as we move into 2010.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of JPMorgan.\nMike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan:  Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey, John, could you just walk us through -- I mean, looking at the postpaid ARPU trends, still looking at growth it's fairly tepid, I am just trying to figure out if you could talk about some of the voice weakness and some of the triggers there. And then second, on the wireline side, you mentioned some of the backend loading of the 2009 headcount, could you give us a sense for how the 2010 headcount reduction in your mind will sort of roll out throughout the year? And then lastly on wireline, as operating income continues to sort of decline to getting close to almost a 0% margin, is there some sort of asset write down trigger that you're looking at? Thanks.\nJohn Killian:\n : Now the drivers here, there's a couple of different things that I'd point to. Clearly as people have gone through bigger buckets of minutes, we're seeing less overage. That's not a surprise. We expect that to continue particularly with the attractiveness of our new unlimited plan. And we think by the way that's going to lead to people buying up and that will create a good opportunity. Texting has taken the place as we all know that. The explosion on texting has had some pressure. Another area where we had some pressure in the third and fourth quarter is we had a lot of growth in our family plan customers. Some of that was tied more growth than we had had in the first and second quarter, some of that was tied to the Alltel billing system conversions that we went through so that also contributed. And then as you look at the full year, early in the year, we were not participating as much as we would have liked to on the higher end of the marketplace, part of that because of the device lineup.  So I think as we've gone through 2009, Lowell and his team did a terrific job getting the device line up in a very strong position. From a wireline perspective, we're still driving a lot of cash flow in that business. You saw the fourth quarter numbers, the full year numbers, so cash flow is very strong. A number of the earnings depressants are non cash in nature. It's some of the pension and benefit items. The FiOS investment is doing extremely well. We have very high depreciation reserves in the non-FiOS area, so we always go through all of the GAAP requirements on impairments and those kinds of things. We will continue to do that, but as of the moment, we're in good shape there and the cash flow is strong and our depreciation reserves are in pretty good position. I'm going to ask Ivan to comment here too.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: Yeah. On the census in the headcount plans, just to put this in perspective, it's a good question. If you look at 2009 to 2008, the force reductions were about the same in both years, for the core wireline business, about 13,000 in each year. So if you look at 2010 and assume it's about the same number, it's fair to say that the way you calenderize it, it is probably about a third to 40% of that'll be done in the first 4 to 6 months of the year, and then you'll see some reductions a little bit after that with a heavy concentration toward the end of the year, just like we did in 2009. In the fourth quarter 2009, I think our number was 5,000. So I think if you look at it that way you'll see a fairly big down payment early in the year, some spreading out, and then another big lump of it, our actions will be at the end of the year.\nMike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan: Thanks, Ivan. And John, any thoughts on the impact on CPE in the quarter on those enterprise and wholesale trends? Is it a meaningful difference? \nJohn Killian: Any impact on what?\nMike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan: The impact of CPE on the enterprise and wholesale revenue growth trends?\nJohn Killian: Yeah. I'd say Mike if there was something that maybe surprised us a little bit in the fourth quarter was if you remember in the third quarter we thought we were seeing a rebound in enterprise and even a little bit in wholesale in terms of traffic. We didn't see that carry through in the fourth quarter and we actually saw some economic weakness there. Our CPE numbers were actually down in the fourth quarter, both from the third quarter and down pretty significantly from the fourth quarter of '08 , not because of product, not because of portfolio, not because of losing deals, there was less spending being done in the marketplace.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: Yeah. I might add that our activity is still strong. I mean, I think there are a lot of RFPs, we're making a lot of visits, we're talking to a lot of customers. I mean it just seems that we\u2019re encouraged by the fact that people are getting ready to get ready to do something. But you go across the country and you look at people's spending habits, they just do not seem to be in a position where people are unleashing their budgets, and I think this is what we saw in the CPE budget and I suspect we'll continue to see that for a while longer.\nMike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. \nTim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.:\n : And then, John, there's a lot of moving parts in earnings per share this year. Can you just give us maybe some really, really high level do you think you can actually grow earnings per share this year even with the disposition of the Frontier assets and other assets given all the pressure from that and from the headwinds on the pension? Thanks.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: Okay. We'll double team this question. I think on the iPhone question, I think your summary is fair. I think we should start out with the idea that as the iPhone has been out in the marketplace now for several years, they've gotten some good traction. It's a good product, and they've done a good job. I think as you move forward though, as we move to LTE and we start to see a completely different dynamic out in the marketplace with eight times the capacity and much lower cost per transport of a megabit, I think we're feeling very comfortable that the smart phone market will move into a more parity for us with respect to handling that.  We have done a lot of work at modeling what the Droid does, what the Palm will do, what the Eris does and what the Blackberry does, so we kind of feel we know what the capacity limitations are in this and we're feeling pretty good that we're out in front of this issue. And to the extent that usage picks up, I think our guys have done a very good job in making sure that we stay in front of that tissue. And I know most investors are worried about that, but over the course of the last 10 years, this is kind of what we pride ourselves on doing and so I'm comfortable that we're in good shape on this.  We spent a lot more capital in the last two years on capacity than probably people realize. And I think, when you look out as we move into 2011 and we start to get into full deployment of LTE, we're going to get a big, big improvement in terms of our efficiency, and so we're feeling good about that. So I wouldn't think there's anything to worry about on the capital. When something comes along that would drive us to suggest that we need to spend more ,we'll tell you. I mean, I don't think at this point there's anything to worry about. Now on EPS, I'm not too sure we're going to be able to give you more than I gave you earlier, but I'm anxious to see what John's going to say about it.\nJohn Killian: Yeah. So, Tim, let me just walk you through a couple of things here. So if you think about full year '09, we're $2.40 of EPS. The non-operational factors that we're looking at right now are P&D (ph) which is $0.04 to $0.06, so use $0.05. The trust property sale which we're targeting close by the end of the third quarter is about $0.06, also so use $0.05 for that. So take the $2.40, take it down $0.10 for that, you're at like a $2.30 number. The goal of the management team is to show operational growth off of that $2.30, so that's what we're very focused on. We have a number of things that I think will help us there. If you think about the wireless business, we believe we will grow profitability in the wirelesses business, we're going to have pretty good revenue growth we think. We're going to continue to grow our share as we mentioned earlier, more data plan penetration should be very positive to us, and we'll also have the benefit of the synergies.  On the wireline business, we have the same kind of issues we had in '09 to work through. We will see some benefit from the force reductions, but the biggest unknowns to me right now is what impact is the economy going to have? So our plan assumes there's a pretty good recovery in the second half of 2010, that really is key to our performance. If you look at '09, by our estimates, the economy lost about 1 million non-farm jobs from an employment standpoint. We see that growing as we go through '10. The first quarter we see slightly down. In our forecasts that's what we're assuming, but a pickup in the second half of the year. So that will be a big variable which will have impact. If we do better on the economy I think we'll see positive volumes coming through our wholesale business and our enterprise business from that perspective. So it certainly is our focus to grow organically beyond the adjustments. By the way, on the Frontier related spend, we're targeting second quarter close on that, so we'll work through the details of that as we get closer to a close. \nTim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks. And are you assuming increased dilution if you do get the iPhone or other smart phones? I mean, those devices do have a lot higher handset subsidies. Would that not have an impact on your earnings?\nJohn Killian: Tim, we've already factored into our assumptions very strong smart phone performance. You asked, I think I mentioned earlier our base is about 26% smart or multimedia. Fourth quarter our factor on that was about 2.5 times that on our direct sales. So we're seeing good performance on the smart phone and multimedia side. Our plan assumes that. It actually assumes greater than that from a sales perspective as we go through 2010 and that's how we pack it in.\nTim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Very helpful, thank you.\nRon Lataille: Operator, at this point I'd like to turn the call over to Ivan for some concluding comments.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: Yeah. I think John just summarized very well. Just a couple of points, I think, first of all, thank you all for your questions. You picked up on all the key points, so you all know the issues that we're working on. If I had to put a small sort of emphasis on a couple of things, let me just make sure that we're all on the same place.  So when we look at 2010, looking at wireless, we're committed to maintain reasonable growth and profitable growth and we understand that it can't come at any cost, but we do think we have a differentiated business with key attributes, and we can drive continued expansion of our share in this space, and we'll do that and we'll do it smartly. One of the things we haven't talked about is that we have lots of opportunities in wireless to continue to even make the business more efficient. I think if you look at our cost numbers in 2009, you would see that there's probably room for improvement to get our cost of gross adds or cost of business into even a better shape. So I think part of the issues you raised about how we fund the growth and how we maintain profitably, we\u2019re here to make sure that we do as good a job as possible in wireless on that, and the Alltel synergies helped with that a great deal. On the wireline side, I'd like you to think about the fact that we feel we have a great platform in FiOS, but we recognize that our total value creation is not being helped unless we start to turn the corner on moving the margin issue up again. And we're not going to overstate what we can do, but the issue there is, profitability in the wireline section is going to be a focus for us, so we need to sort of build some momentum, so that as we head towards the end of the year and into next year we can see some good progress on that. Our strong suit, as I said earlier, is going to be our operating metrics are good, our cash is strong, our dividend is strong, our balance sheet is strong, so the key for us is until the economy picks up is to hunker down and do all the things that you would do from a smart cash management position, make sure we return sufficient value to shareholders to keep people interested in our stock, and then participate in a broader expansion of the economy once that begins to happen.  So Ron, let me turn it back to you now.\nRon Lataille: Okay. Thank you, Ivan. And that concludes our call today. I appreciate everybody listening in. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes the call. You can now disconnect. Thank you for participating in today's conference call."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-10-26 13:54:07", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations John F.

Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs\nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your conference host, Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations Web site. This call is being webcast and if you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our Web site.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Web site. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our Web site. Next, I would like to quickly cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, reported earnings per diluted share were $0.41. adjusted earnings per share, before the effects of special items, were $0.60.  We are excluding the following special items from adjusted results. The first item is an after-tax charge of $372.0 million, or $0.13 per share, for pension settlement losses resulting from our separation plans. Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. The next item is an after-tax charge of $103.0 million, or $0.04 per share, which is for merger, integration, and acquisition costs relating to Alltel. We are also excluding a $41.0 million after-tax charge, or $0.02 per share, for non-operational costs incurred in connection with the spinoff of our local exchange business in 14 states. These costs are primarily related to network, software, and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian.\nJohn F. Killian: Good morning to everyone. Before we get into the details of the third quarter, I want to make just a few general comments. When I look at the quarter, I believe the results show good financial discipline throughout the business, which is driving excellent growth in cash flow from operations and free cash flow. We continue to tightly manage capital spending and while the economy continues to create headwinds for us, we are taking steps to offset the current impacts as much as possible and I am confident that as the economy gets better we will see improvements in our results. We are also taking longer-term actions to significantly reduce our cost structure to improve productivity as our business evolves. With that, starting on Slide 3, you can see that we produced $0.60 of adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.86 per share. Cash flow from operations of $23.1 billion in the first nine months increased $3.2 billion, or 16% year-over-year, driven by strong cash generation in wireless. Free cash flow of $10.7 billion year-to-date was significantly higher than last year, up $3.3 billion for 45%. We have seen strong cash flow growth each quarter this year, and particularly this quarter, reflecting growth in strategic areas and our continued focus on operating and capital discipline.  Capital expenditures, including amounts related to our Alltel acquisition, were down $125.0 million, or 1% year-to-date, reflecting the tightness with which we are managing capital. And our capex to revenue ratio continues to improve. As you know, our board of directors approved a 3.3% dividend increase in September, which on an annual basis, increases our dividend from $1.84 to $1.90 per share. This is the third consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, for a cumulative total of 17.3%. These dividend increases demonstrate our board's confidence and the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet, our financial discipline, and our commitment to return cash to shareholders while continuing to invest for long-term growth. We also reduced debt this quarter. On a consolidated basis, net debt at the end of the third quarter was $61.6 billion, down $2.5 billion since the end of June, which is about 1.7x EBITDA for the last twelve months on a pro forma basis. Let's take a closer look at the revenue trends, starting on Slide 4. In spite of the challenging environment, third quarter consolidated revenues grew both sequentially and year-over-year. Similarly, last quarter, top-line results were mixed. All of our strategic areas continue to post good growth, particularly wireless data and files, but we continue to see weakness in the business markets, primarily in volume-driven voice products. Let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless on Slide 5. Our Wireless business turned in another quarter of solid revenue growth, industry-leading profitability, and exceptionally strong cash generation. Total operating revenues for the quarter were $15.8 billion, up 24.4% from a year ago. On a pro forma basis, total operating revenue growth was 4.9% while total service revenue was up 6.1% year-over-year. EBITDA was $6.2 billion in the quarter, up 9.2% from last year on a pro forma basis. And our EBITDA margin on service revenue remained very strong at 46.1%. Wireless capital spending was $1.8 billion in the third quarter, bringing us to a year-to-date total of $5.1 billion. EBITDA less capex was $13.3 billion year-to-date, which is very strong cash flow performance. The integration of Alltel is going according to plan. Our store rebranding efforts across the country are complete. Network conversions are well underway and on track. Essentially all of the former post-paid Alltel customers have been converted to our billing system, and prepaid customers will be completely converted by the end of November. So another quarter of disciplined performance by our Wireless business as we continue to effectively balance both growth and profitability.  Let's take a closer look now at the Wireless retail market on Slide 6. Retail continues to be our primary focus and represents the largest portion of our Wireless business. 97% of our 89.0 million customer base is retail. 81.0 million, or 91%, are retail, post-paid subscribers.  In terms of customer growth, we continue to take a strong share of overall gross adds and maintain excellent churn metrics. Gross adds were 5.2 million in the quarter, total net adds were 1.2 million with 970,000 retail additions, 943,000 of which were retail post-paid. Net adds from resellers totaled 270,000 in the quarter, including one-time customer conversions from some of our reseller partners. An example would be Great Call, which announced in August that its Jitterbug cell phone would utilize the Verizon Wireless network through our open-development program. I would also note that we have no arrangements with resellers that provide for unlimited usage for a fixed price. My key point here is that we look for opportunities to capture share in both the retail and reseller markets on a profitable basis. But as I said earlier, our primary focus continues to be on the retail, post-paid market. Moving to our churn metrics, retail post-paid churn of 1.13% was up 5 basis points year-over-year and total churn was up 6 basis points, which are improvements over the past several quarterly comparisons. We continue to attribute these upticks primarily to cyclical factors that have driven business customers-related disconnects of PC cards and voice lines. Retail service revenue in the third quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year. Retail post-paid ARPU of $52.78 was stable with 0.2% growth compared with the third quarter of last year. We did see some year-over-year declines this quarter in air time usage in prepaid and reseller, which resulted in a 0.5% decline in retail service ARPU and a 0.8% decline in total service ARPU. We still believe that strong data growth will continue to offset pressures on the voice side, particularly on a retail, post-paid base. The continued introduction of new smartphone devices and increased adoption of mobile broadband should drive retail, post-paid ARPU and overall revenue growth. Total data revenues, as highlighted on Slide 7, topped the $4.0 billion mark this quarter, up more than $900.0 million, or nearly 29% growth. Growth in wireless data has been nothing short of remarkable. Think about this: in 2006 data revenues for the year totaled $4.0 billion. Now, less than three years later, we are generating $4.0 billion per quarter, and we are planning for continued growth, driven by increasing mobile broadband adoption in innovative new applications. Total data ARPU was up 20.7% and retail data ARPU was slightly higher, with 21.6% growth.  Data revenues represented just over 30% of total service revenues this quarter compared with 25% a year ago. Non-messaging services, which make up about 60% of total data revenue, increased 34% compared with third quarter last year. Clearly, more and more customers are taking advantage of data products and applications that leverage our extensive 3G data network capabilities. Messaging, which makes up the remaining 40% of data revenue, grew 22% versus the same quarter last year. PDAs and smartphone sales remained strong, once again representing about 40% of new device sales this quarter. The percentage of retail post-paid customers with these devices nearly doubled in the past year and now represent 23% of our base. And there is certainly upside to further penetration as we introduce more of these high-end devices, which generally require data plants. In addition, continued growth in mobile broadband devices, including new products like netbooks and MiFi devices, are also helping to expand the wireless data market. We also recently expanded our data pricing plans to include two new lower-cost usage-based options for customers with feature phones who may not necessarily want to pay for unlimited data. We think the new plans will be an attractive for moderate data users and will stimulate demand and expand the market. So looking ahead in the wireless market, we see plenty of revenue growth opportunities, driven, of course, by mobile broadband. We see several catalysts for the next phases of growth, including innovative devices, applications and content, and the much higher bandwidth and capacity of 4G technology. In the near term, we are very excited about our new device lineup, which we think will create demand and stimulate further broadband data usage. We also see exciting development in terms of applications and content, including the launch of our Vcast application store soon. Our recent announcement with Google, which leverages our network and the Android open platform, gives us a great opportunity to innovate and accelerate delivery of unique applications to customers. The 4G technology evolution with LTE is a huge growth opportunity for us and one that we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on. We have the largest and most reliable 3G network today and we will extend our leadership position with our 4G network. We are on schedule for commercial introduction LTE next year with 25 to 30 markets, covering approximately 100.0 million POPs [points of presence] by year end. We expect to have nation-wide 4G coverage with LTE, featuring our contiguous, coast-to-coast 700 Mega Hertz spectrum with its unmatched capabilities for speed and network efficiency by the end of 2013. Let's move now to our Wireline segment on Slide 9. In the Wireline business, bios continue to gain scale and broadband and video drive growth and consumer revenue. As I mentioned earlier, business revenues have been adversely affected by the economy but we are competing well and we had several large customers wins in the enterprise market in the last few months. From a profitability perspective, Wireline margins continue to be pressured by both cyclical and secular effects, as well as incremental pension and OPEB costs. EBITDA declined $69.0 million sequentially, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 23.7% this quarter. We expect margins will improve over time through a combination of better revenue performance, an improving economy, ongoing workforce reductions, and other cost-saving initiatives. Earlier this month we announced a reorganization of our Wireline segment. We believe combining our telecom and business groups into one will enhance our effectiveness, and more significantly, reduce our costs. I will provide more details on our Wireline transformation and cost initiatives in a few minutes, but before I get to that, let's take a closer look at Wireline revenues, starting with mass markets. In mass markets, demand for our broadband and video products continues to drive revenue and ARPU growth. Consumer revenues in the third quarter grew 1.2% over last year, quarterly FiOS revenues totaled more than $1.4 billion, up 56% compared with the third quarter last year. Consumer ARPU also increased to just over $75.00 this quarter, up 12.6% from a year ago. And FiOS ARPU remains very strong, at more than $137.00 per month. Let's take a closer look at our FiOS results on Slide 11. On a year-to-date basis, we have added about 18% more FiOS TV and Internet customers than last year. This growth comes from both new markets and deeper penetration in existing markets. In the third quarter we added 191,000 FiOS TV and 198,000 FiOS Internet customers, increasing our penetration to 25% for TV and 29% for Internet. Although net adds were less than the record adds of the last two quarters, FiOS continues to have good momentum in the market. Churn remained low in the quarter, gross sales were lower, primarily due to a change in promotional activity. Overall, we are on track from a deployment standpoint, with about 45% of our premises passed. FiOS Triple-Play availability has expanded to 10.9 million homes, or about 34% of total households. And last week we announced new Quad-Play and Triple-Play bundles in several East Coast markets, so we continue to believe we can add about 1.0 million new FiOS customers each year. Let's turn next to the rest of our Wireline revenues, which include a global enterprise and global wholesale. In our global markets I see mixed results and a continuation of some trends that have been affecting both the retail and wholesale markets. On a positive side, we generated sequential growth of 2.5% in global enterprise revenues in the third quarter, primarily driven by continued demand for IP services. We also had a smaller impact from foreign exchange effects in the quarter. However, the cumulative effect of unemployment continues to impact usage volumes. We are also not seeing any significant change in capital or IT spending by our large customers. The primary leading indicator for sustained improvement in the business market will be a return to hiring on the part of our enterprise customers. We did see a pickup in CPE sales from our existing customers this quarter but not enough for me to get too optimistic. While certain volumetrics have shown some stabilization, I am still not seeing meaningful improvement. For example, enterprise business long distance voice minutes were down 4.5% year-over-year but were stable on a sequential basis.  So while I'm certainly not comfortable calling a bottom, I would say that I am cautiously optimistic. As I said a few minutes ago, we had several very good wins this quarter, including Jet Blue, Manulife Financial, and several government contracts. Some of these wins included integrated IT and communication solutions as well as security and consulting services. Enterprise customers are increasingly interested in managed and professional services capabilities and I believe we are well positioned in these areas. One last area I would like to discuss is the evolving Wireline business model. Specifically I am referring to the continuing transformation of our network, products and services, customer interfaces, capital programs, workforce, and cost structure. I think you are well aware of the strategic divestitures and investments we have made to accelerate growth in the consumer broadband and video market and in the global enterprise market. And you also know that these transformative moves have changed our revenue mix and driven improvement in top-line performance. But there is more to do. The investments in broadband video and global IP will also help us transform the cost structure of our business. For example, the FiOS platform creates an enormous opportunity for consumers to purchase innovative products and services which will drive revenue growth. But it also enables us to develop a business model with a different lower cost structure, with less reliance on a traditional copper network infrastructure.  The changes we recently made in our wireline organization are to simplify the business and accelerate getting bottom-line performance. We believe this is the right time to do this and we are in the process of aligning our cost structure to improve productivity. From a headcount prospective, as the businesses change, we have been shifting forth to the growth areas and steadily reducing our overall workforce, but we need to do more and at an accelerated pace. Our goal in the second half of 2009 is to downsize by more than 8,000 in workforce and contractors. We reduced Wireline headcount by 4,000 in the third quarter and we are on track to downsize by at least that amount in the fourth quarter. Total headcount was down 5,000 from the end of last quarter. Along with these force reductions, we are also looking at a comprehensive redesign of our entire call center infrastructure, including the reducing of the number of call centers and improving our utilization and efficiency metrics, and we have a Wireline network convergence initiative underway that will result in operating efficiency improvements. Throughout the year we have been very focused on improving our capital efficiency and operating with a great deal of financial discipline. Wireline capital spending is down by $704.0 million, or 9.6% year-to-date, and should continue to run below last year's levels. I mentioned earlier how tightly we were managing these costs and we will continue to do so. I am expecting that we will substantially complete our FiOS build program by the end of 2010, which alone should result in about $2.0 billion of capital savings each year. Obviously this will significantly reduce our capital requirements beginning in 2011, thus improving free cash flow and investment returns. I am confident that the steps we will be taking will simplify our organization, improve our ability to capitalize on new areas of growth, and achieve improved levels of productivity.  So to quickly sum up, we turned in another quarter of solid growth in all our strategic areas. Our cash flow growth remains strong and our balance sheet is healthy and will continue to improve over the next few years as we reduce wireless debt. We have industry-leading margins in our Wireless business, with tremendous growth opportunities ahead in mobile broadband. As I just discussed, we will continue transforming the Wireline business.  On the strategic front, our Alltel integration continues to go very well and our access line divestitures are on track. And with that, I would like to turn it back to Ron.\nRon Lataille: Ivan and John are now available to take questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik - UBS.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Could you talk a little about the wireless market in terms of the competitive pressure you're seeing? We saw some new pricing out from T-Mobile today and correspondingly, I think both Verizon and AT&T saw lower minutes of use, so if you could talk a little bit, maybe separate the data side from the voice side and what you see going forward. And then, Ivan, while we have you, could you just update us on where we are in terms of the access line spin, if you are seeing any potential slowdown from a regulatory standpoint in light of what we saw from FairPoint?\nJohn F. Killian: I will start on the wireless side. You know, we were pleased with our quarter. When you look at net adds, 1.2 million in total, 970,000 on the retail side, we thought it was a very good performance in the third quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity ahead of us in the fourth quarter. Many of you have seen the advertising that we've had out for the launch of the Droid.  We announced, really today, that the Storm 2 will be available starting Wednesday. I happen to be using the Storm 2 and it's a great enhancement from where we were before. The Droid device, a number of our wireless team and Chingon are using it in pre-launch and really think it's going to be ground-breaking and have a lot of opportunity. We continue to see very good growth on data ARPU. Obviously we are watching all of the pricing changes. The T-Mobile changes just came out overnight. They look to be on the conservative side of what all the rumors were, in terms of what was going to happen with that pricing. We really don't see it breaking new ground, don't see, in our mind, a need to respond to that. I think the other point here I would make is our network, we believe, continues to differentiate ourselves and puts us in a very good position.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: And on the access line spins, the regulatory proceedings are moving along. There are three or four jurisdictions that are getting closer to decisions. Frontier has done a very good job at differentiating why this transaction is different than any of their previous transactions, so we are still confident that this will get closed on time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: You talked in your comments about the LTE roll out. Can you help us think about the capital spend and the potential dilution from that? What are we seeing in terms of your spending in the second half of this year and next year? Are you able to pretty much incorporate this into a sort of run rate capex and run rate margins or is there likely to be some additional pressure from that?\nJohn F. Killian: From a capex perspective, we put guidance out back in September for the full year of 2009 of a range of $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion. I am sure you have already done the math and in order to hit the low end of that, we would have to spend about $5.0 billion of capex in the fourth quarter. We have been spending something like $4.3 billion, around that, per quarter, in that range. So at worst case, we're going to be on the very low end of the $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion. I actually think we'll do better than that and run below that for the full year. The LTE roll out, we are spending some capital on LTE in 2009. As you know, we're in trial mode right now. I do not see that being incremental. I see our ability to absorb that within run rates of existing capital. We have, as you look ahead to 2010, in 2009 we had more spending on Alltel integration capital. We won't have much of that in 2010 so I don't think you're really going to see any blip whatsoever from the LTE program.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research: Just a follow-up on some of your comments on the enterprise side of the business, and wholesale as well. Enterprise and wholesale showed upticks sequentially. Should we be surprised by that in the context of the comments that you made about still the business condition as being on the software side. And as you look at the competitive landscape, are you seeing more pricing pressure or is the pressures on revenue in the year-over-year basis more a volume issue?\nJohn F. Killian: We are very pleased with where our enterprise business is. We've been saying that repeatedly over the last couple of quarters. We've had great success in the marketplace with customer relationships. We've won several new deals. We really have had virtually no defections, so the business is performing extremely well. We were pleased with the sequential growth in revenue that was up 2.5%. We are showing improvements there. I think a lot of that is driven by the success we've had with various wins in the marketplace. We're seeing CIOs start to be a little bit more willing to spend on new capital, new initiatives. We still see a slight drag from employment, that we think once employment really comes back in a bigger way, we will do extremely well in the enterprise space and we are very well positioned. Our sales funnels are very strong. The sales force, I still have personally a lot of discussions with the sales team, visit customers with them from time to time. I think we have a lot of opportunities globally in front of us, not just domestically in the U.S. Another point we made was we saw basically no sequential decline in LD minutes going over the network. So sequentially we saw some stabilization there. Year-on-year we were down but from that perspective. You know, pricing is about where it is. We haven't seen much of a drop on the pricing side. We've seen more stability. That's what we would expect as we go through and enter 2010.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden - BAS-ML.\nDavid Barden - BAS-ML: A couple on wireless if I could. John, with respect to the Alltel transaction and the synergies we were targeting for run rate by the end of this year and into next, could you update us with respect to your thinking on balancing how you are deploying that margin competitively in the market from a handset perspective, and should we be seeing now, even though it's a seasonally tougher market quarter, should we be looking for rising margins again in wireless as a function of that. And if I could, on wireline, go back to comments you made a few weeks ago about wireline. You were more conservative on wireline margins coming into the third quarter, looking for growth into fourth quarter and 2010. I'm wondering if, based on your plans, you can reiterate or clarify those expectations for wireline margin.\nJohn F. Killian: A lot there in the question so let me see if I hit the items. When you take Alltel, to begin with, we are very pleased with the Alltel transaction. We are well ahead in terms of integration. We have converted all of the four area billing systems onto Verizon. Our team has done a terrific job with rebranding, capturing the roaming synergies. We said for the full year we would have $500.0 million to $600.0 million of expense synergies. We are very confident with that and think we will have a nice contribution in 2010. From a margin perspective, we've have three quarters in a row of 46%. We have always said we're very focused on balancing both growth and profitability and we continue to be focused there. The synergies, there are a number of moving parts in the wireless business beyond just the synergy in equipment subsidies or cost of acquisition. If you actually look at equipment subsidies, they were down, on a per unit basis, in the third quarter from the second quarter. Our operating team, at times, wanted to be a little more aggressive in the quarter. We intentionally held them back, recognizing that we had more of our product launches coming in the fourth quarter and we're very excited about the product launches we have coming along.  So we are very confident in the wireless business continuing to grow, continuing to deliver the industry-leading profitability that it has been delivering, continuing to grow cash flow, because cash flow is extremely strong in that business. Now on the wireline side, we are very confident that we have all of the right initiatives in place to improve margin over time. We are focused on the FiOS side, we are pleased with FiOS development, focused on continuing to drive penetration and we continue to look at all kinds of revenue opportunities in that business. We think FiOS will continue to expand opportunities to enhance revenue. From a cost standpoint, there isn't a line of costs that we're not focused on. As you know, we had said we would reduce the workforce, including contractors, by at least 8,000 in the second half of the year. Total business, we reduced 5,000 this quarter; the wireline side, we reduced 4,000. We are well on track for the cost-reduction efforts we have. All other areas of both SG&A\u2014real estate, procurement, cost centers\u2014we have plans in all of those areas to continue to take costs out of the equation. We are also watching our capital spend in that business. We think we will get some help ultimately as the economy comes back, in the enterprise and wholesale space. So we think we've got all the right initiatives to drive that margin improvement over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Cusick - Macquarie Research Equities.\nPhil Cusick - Macquarie Research Equities: Can we talk about your device strategy a little bit? You're integrated devices are ramping up really quickly. Where do you expect that to be as a portion of the mix next year? And then how do you plan to focus? Do you want to focus on, really, the differentiated devices here but you've got Palm Pre and we believe Pixie coming fairly soon. Are you just going to have a wide range and then focus on a couple that are very differentiated? And finally, within that, also, the sort of Android App Store, Palm App Store, versus your own application suite, how do you think about that these days? Does it even matter anymore?\nJohn F. Killian: From a device perspective here, we have always said that we were going to have a wide array of product offerings in our lineup. We have continued to do that. We rolled out, in July, the BlackBerry Tour. That has done extremely well for us; we believe it will continue to do well. Storm 2 being launched this week. I mentioned on the front end here, we're working very closely on Android-based devices.  And I want to make the distinction that the Droid will have very different capabilities. Yes, it uses the Android open platform but the design of the set by Motorola, the browsing capability, the speed, we believe will really set those apart. We will be introducing the Palm early next year but our focus right now is maximizing the devices that we're launching in the fourth quarter right now. From an applications perspective, we will be launching the Vcast applications store later this year. We are working with over 1,000 developers on that right now. We had our open development conference. So we see a huge opportunity to generate additional data revenue, additional subscribers, from the applications work that we're doing. So we think we're in a very well, good position. Ivan wants to add a comment.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: Just to add sort of a strategic framework for this, the other way that we would ask our investors to think about this is when you deploy 4G that really pushes you to think about a broad array of devices as opposed to just the specific smart devices that we see out there now. The ones that are out now are terrific, they're getting better. So when you look at 4G and then you look at machine-to-machine, data revenue opportunity will come in so many different places that we would want to make sure that our strategy has the breadth to capture a lot of things and not to focus just on any one or two or three devices.  So our view is to lay the groundwork for a very broad array of data growth, which leads, obviously, to the combination of integrated applications, video, and also to sophisticated data applications.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris King - Stifel Nicolaus.\nChris King - Stifel Nicolaus: Two quick questions. First of all, with respect to LTE, just to follow-up on your last comment there, was wondering if there was any change, really, in the LTE handset development time line that you were looking at from your various vendors? In other words, are you guys still planning on essentially doing broadband laptop cards and the like next year over the 100.0 million POPs or so that you would plan to have done by year end? And secondly, it may be a little too early for this, but just wanted to see if you had an initial take on pension and OPEB costs going into 2010 and how we should begin to think about that from an earnings standpoint? \nJohn F. Killian: On LTE, in terms of devices, really no change from what we were thinking before. The initial roll out will be with laptop air cards, broadband access applications. I think we do believe as LTE begins to get more and more excitement, which we think it is and you see more and more carriers start talking about it, even on the handset side, people will start looking to move more aggressively. But that is our initial plan there. On pension and OPEB, it's too early to give you any kind of indication for 2010. Obviously the factors that will drive this is what's the ROA this year on our assets. We're performing well, as you would expect, through the end of September and October looks like it's going to be a pretty good month so we think that will probably be good. Discount rate will be another factor. We will have to see where that is as we end at year end. Our employee levels are changing and that will also be an impact here but we're not ready to provide any guidance on 2010.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.\nTim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Ivan, while we have you, maybe a couple of strategic questions. Can you maybe talk about where we think the initiatives going with wireline/wireless integration? Is it more important to enterprise versus consumer?  And I guess related to that, the second part of that is how important is having this capability on a global basis? It seems like you were emphasizing it a little bit more in the press release. And then third, maybe you can't comment on it too much, but on the iPhone, could you talk about if you would like to get the iPhone or not and maybe why Apple wouldn't build a cd-made version of the iPhone for the U.S.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: I think the way we think about what you call wireline integration is we have a chance of developing combinations of applications around the services, so rather than just a bundling of the products\u2014as you know, we've just introduced a quad-play\u2014we have other forms of products that we have in the pipeline where you would be able to use your handsets from wireless to do different things on your fixed-line network. So our view of this integrations is very important and I think it's important because it adds a marginal expansion of revenue growth in places where we can develop these kind of cross-integration products. And I think globally the reason we emphasize that is that we feel we have a really strong BlackBerry lineup and we have a lot of new devices coming out. We have lots of great capabilities in our global IP network, and as John said earlier, we feel we're well positioned in our enterprise space.  So I think you will see us, from a global standpoint, focus mostly our efforts there on the business market. We're doing that. Now in terms of the iPhone, there's nothing really different about this. I think Lowell would remind us all that this is a decision that's exclusively in Apple's court. We obviously would be interested at any point in the future they thought it would make sense for them to have us as a partner. And so we will leave it with them on that score. I have no further thoughts about why they may have done whatever they did. What they've done has been successful so we have to sit back and give them credit for that. But in the future, what we've done is what John said earlier, we've expanded our BlackBerry base, we've expanded our base of other devices. We now have the Droid coming out. We have an updated Storm coming out. We have application stores coming out. So I think our view is to broaden the base of choice for customers and hopefully along the way Apple, as well as others, will decide to jump on the bandwagon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Couple of questions, but maybe first back to just the wireline margin compression we've seen. Just maybe more of a hindsight-type of question. If you think about the different segments\u2014enterprise, wholesale, and consumer\u2014which segment would you say you are experiencing sort of disproportionately higher margin pressure to this point? And then, quickly, on FiOS symmetrics, you took up pricing in the quarter, you pulled off some other promotional activity, which had an unexpected hit to the net add trajectory, to some extent. As we look forward, is this a new run rate of net add growth that we should think about if you look to balance growth with the return profile?\nJohn F. Killian: If you look at the margin compression, enterprise has held up fairly well. We've had the revenue declines but on a relative basis we knew that was coming, we were able to take costs out fairly early in the process, so enterprise has held up relatively well. Consumer, we've had a little bit more pressure. Now, that was expected, as you're in the middle of the FiOS roll out, you're being aggressive in terms of customer acquisition. You have some of the secular change going on, you experience a little bit more pressure on that side. From a wireless run rate, we indicated that we thought we had the ability to continue to grow at about 1.0 million post-paid net adds per quarter, a million net adds, and we performed well in the third quarter. We are not about to say we're going to limit the possibility of growth. We think we have a great lineup in the fourth quarter, a great lineup as we enter 2010, with LTE coming. We think there are substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. I mentioned earlier, we kind of kept our powder a little bit dry. We actually spent less advertising dollars in the third quarter than we had in the second quarter. Part of that was we knew that the new device lineup was coming in the fourth quarter. So we are still very optimistic and bullish about the ability to grow the wireless business.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. On the second part of the question, it was actually more on FiOS metrics, on the wireline side, where you had took up pricing and then pulled off some of the promotions. Just wondering if we sort of reset to a new net add profile on that side of the business.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: I think I would like to answer that from an operating standpoint and then if John wants to clarify further\u2014I don't think we intend to reset. What happened is that in the very beginning of the year we had targeted about a million plus and we had a couple of good quarters in a row and so we try to see how much we can continue to super charge that. As it turns out, we had a couple of promotions that worked, didn't work as well, so I don't think it's a question of are we resetting it, we've never changed our view of the million. What happened is we had a couple of better quarters and we toyed with how we could sustain that and found that it was difficult in light of maintaining a fiscal discipline against it. So the issue is we've never changed off the million plus.\nRon Lataille: That concludes our questions session. What I'd like to do now is hand it over to Ivan for some concluding remarks.\nIvan G. Seidenberg: Just a couple of quick points. I think the third quarter for us was a good balancing quarter for us to get line of sight on what we feel we need to do for the rest of this year and as we prepare ourselves for 2010. What we found is that we focused a great deal on balancing our growth against our margin performance and our net income performance and as we go forward we have better of line of sight now, in terms of what we feel that we need to do to accelerate data growth and wireless through handset deployment, applications deployment, and focus on the fundamentals in that business, to improve our net add performance as we go into next year. In the wireline business our view there is, as John said, we have good line of sight in where we think enterprise is and what we need to do in consumer is maintain the focus on revenue growth as it relates to FiOS and data and to balance the net add costs but at the same time pick up the pace on our efficiency initiatives, which we have a lot in place and you're seeing the benefits of some of that begin to take hold in the third and fourth quarter of this year. So looking out into 2010, I think our company feels that we have good line of sight in terms of what we need to do to do a better job next year than we've done this year.\nRon Lataille: That concludes our call today and I thank everybody for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-07-27 12:28:18", "content": "Executives:  Ron Lataille \u2013 SVP IR John Killian \u2013 CFO Denny Strigl \u2013 President & COO \nAnalysts:  David Barden - BAS-ML Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley John Hodulik \u2013 UBS Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs Mike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan Chris King \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus [Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer] Phil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie \nPresentation: \nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your conference host, Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast and if you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. Next I'd like to quickly cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings for the second quarter of 2009. In the second quarter reported earnings per diluted share were $0.52. Adjusted earnings per share before the effects of special items were $0.63. We are excluding the following special items from adjusted results.  The first item is an after-tax charge of $253 million or $0.09 per share for pension settlement losses resulting from our separation plans. Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. We are also excluding an after-tax charge of $60 million or $0.02 per share which is for merger integration costs and acquisition related fees. Amortization expense related to customer lists is not part of the special items that we have excluded from adjusted results. This represented a little more than $0.01 of EPS in the second quarter and is estimated to be about $0.05 for the full year.  Also as we stated last quarter the wireless properties that we will be divesting in connection with the Alltel acquisition are included in our current wireless results and will be until those transactions close. In addition the wireline properties which will be spun off and acquired by Frontier will remain in our results until the closing of that transaction.  With that I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Killian.\nJohn Killian : Thanks Ron and good morning to everyone. Before we get into the details of our quarterly performance, I\u2019d like to share a few of my perspectives on our results. When I look at the quarter I believe that our results show that we are very sound financially and we\u2019re executing with a great deal of discipline.  Clearly the broader economic issues are affecting the business. However I am very pleased with the success we had in wireless, FiOS and strategic business services this quarter. I think this reflects the best assets in the industry, great scale, affective marketing, and a seasoned management team.  I\u2019m already looking ahead at the opportunities we have both in terms of revenue initiatives and cost savings. So while the current environment is challenging, there are still ways we can improve operations and I am very focused on these areas.  So let\u2019s start on slide three with our consolidated results, overall on the top line we generated pro forma revenue growth of nearly 2%. As Ron indicated we produced $0.63 of earnings per share in the second quarter bringing our first half total to $1.26.  Cash flows from operations were strong in the first half of the year, growing nearly 12%. Free cash flow of $6 billion was significantly higher than a year ago, up $1.8 billion year to date. Capital spending was down 3.6% for the first six months. As I said on our first quarter earnings call, we will be very disciplined in terms of capital allocation and spending in order to maximize free cash flow.  As far as the balance sheet is concerned, debt reduction is going according to plan. Net debt stands at $64.1 billion, which is about 1.8x EBITDA for the last 12 months on a pro forma basis. We\u2019ve completely repaid the $12 billion bridge loan associated with the Alltel transaction through the issuance of a series of notes at Verizon Wireless with varying amounts and maturities together with cash generated from operations. Okay, let\u2019s take a closer look at the revenue trends starting on slide four, in the second quarter I would say that there are two trends effecting revenues. First there are several areas of the business that continue to perform well and post solid growth, most notable wireless services and wireless data revenue.  I\u2019ll provide further details in a couple of minutes but I would emphasize that wireless is an increasing percentage of our overall revenues. Wireless currently makes up more than 57% of our top line and after the Frontier transaction it should be more than 60%.  On the wireline side we\u2019re seeing solid growth in FiOS, which is driving good consumer growth and with the enterprise market new services like IP are also performing well. This growth is the result of our consistent approach to network investment and indicates that we continue to compete effectively and provide the products and services that customers continue to find valuable.  The second trend is more obvious, and that is the continued impacts of the economy, especially in the business markets. These adverse effects are primarily in volume driven products most notably voice. And we\u2019re seeing these effects in the small, medium, and large enterprise markets.  In the aggregate second quarter consolidated revenues were still up both sequentially and year over year. Now let\u2019s go through the segments starting with wireless on slide five.  Total operating revenues for the quarter were $15.5 billion, up 27.7% from a year ago. On a pro forma basis total wireless revenues increased 7.6% and more importantly total service revenues were up 9%. And we continue to produce year over year growth in total service ARPU with an increase of 0.6% on a pro forma basis, which is a good result.  Taking a look at customer results we turned in another very good quarter of high quality customer growth. Gross ads of 4.7 million were essentially flat year over year do in part to lower demand on the business side. Net ads totaled 1.1 million, all retail and essentially all postpaid.  Retail prepaid net ads totaled 67,000 in the quarter. So we ended the quarter with a total of 87.7 million customers, 80 million or 91% of our base is retail postpaid. Of the rest, 5.2 million are retail prepaid and about 2.5 million customers are from resellers.  Churn improved sequentially but was up from second quarter last year. On a pro forma basis total churn of 1.37% was up 14 basis points year over year and retail postpaid churn was up 12 basis points to 1.01%. The up tick is primarily due to cyclical factors with about half attributable to business related disconnects of PC cards and the rest mainly line disconnects in small business.  Overall our wireless segment continues to produce solid growth in both customers and revenue. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the drivers of wireless revenue growth. As you know data continues to be the predominant driver of top line growth in wireless. And it is increasingly becoming a larger part of a growing revenue pie representing more than 29% this quarter.  Data revenue growth was 33.2% this quarter with non-messaging services up 44% and messaging up 20%. Data ARPU increased to just $15.00. Customers are increasingly seeking broadband mobility which is expanding the demand for products and devices that leverage on network data capacities.  PDA\u2019s and smart phone sales remained strong representing about 40% of new device sales this quarter. Continued growth in PC cards despite some cyclical effects and new products like netbooks, and MiFi devices are also helping to expand the mobile broadband market.  We see plenty of upside revenue opportunity and the proliferation of new devices in the pipeline will stimulate both adoption and demand for increased wireless broadband data usage. The main point here is that we are leading the industry in the deployment of LTE and we are the most proactive company in enabling and preparing for continued growth in wireless data.  Starting with our acquisition of nation wide 700 megahertz spectrum coupled with our open development initiative, our leadership in the deployment of LTE, the formation of the joint innovation lab, and several other innovative partnerships we continue to position ourselves to benefit from the growth potential of broadband mobility.  Another important area is the growth of mobile applications. We are intent on making the Verizon wireless platform the choice for developers. Tomorrow we\u2019re holding our first ever Verizon Developer Community Conference in San Jose, which will be focused entirely on fostering the development of new mobile applications.  We will detail how developers can take advantage of new tools and resources to build great applications for our more than 87 million customers. There is a lot of excitement building around this event and our goal is to have our App Store up and running by the end of the year.  Clearly we feel very good about the competitiveness of our wireless business. Our second quarter performance once again demonstrates our ability to achieve both solid growth and strong profitability. And this value creating model is producing continued growth and free cash flow.  As you can see on slide seven, EBITDA was $6.2 billion this quarter, up 9.4% from last year on a pro forma basis. The second quarter EBITDA margin on service revenue was an industry leading 46.3%. Wireless capital spending was $1.8 billion in the second quarter for a total of $3.3 billion year to date.  The integration of Alltel is going very well. Nearly half of the former Alltel customer base has been converted to our billing system and they now have access to our full suite of products and services. And we are track to convert essentially all customers by the end of October.  So to sum up, solid growth, profitability and cash flows from our wireless segment, let\u2019s move to wireline. As I indicated earlier we saw a good success in the consumer market as FiOS continues to be a superior product, driving overall growth in consumer revenues. We have great momentum in FiOS which provides us with a significant opportunity to drive further growth in both customers and revenue. FiOS continues to expand into new areas and we plan to have about 70% coverage of our telecom footprint subsequent to the Frontier transaction. In business markets we continue to see economic conditions effecting both revenues and margins. From a profitability perspective wireline margins have been impacted primarily by cyclical economic pressures.  In addition there are headwinds from incremental pension and OPEB costs. I have been very focused on the cost side since taking over as CFO. Although we are taking steps to mitigate the negative impacts of the economy in the short-term, we also need to more significantly reduce the wireline cost structure over the next 12 to 18 months.  As part of our ongoing program to resize and reduce the cost structure we reduced headcount by more 8,000 over the last 12 months. We plan to do more than 8,000 in force and contractor reductions in the second half of this year. We are also attacking all other cost categories include network integration, travel, sourcing, rationalizing our real estate portfolio, and all other areas.  Let\u2019s take a closer look at revenues starting with mass markets, mass markets includes consumer, and small and medium business with a majority of these revenues in the consumer market where FiOS broadband and video continued to drive revenue and ARPU growth. Second quarter consumer revenues grew again this quarter by 2% year over year, FiOS revenues totaled more than $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 60.3% compared with the second quarter last year.  We\u2019ve also seen consistently strong growth in consumer retail ARPU which increased to more than $72.00 this quarter up 13.7% from a year ago. FiOS ARPU remains very strong at more than $135.00 per month. On the traditional access line side of the business we saw modest improvement in the level of total switched access line losses.  We had another great quarter of FiOS performance adding 300,000 TV customers and 303,000 internet customers. Our penetration rates are strong and we continue to expand FiOS availability. In the past 12 months we\u2019ve increased our base of both FiOS TV and FiOS internet customers by more than 1.1 million.  And we\u2019ve expanded the availability of our FiOS triple play by about 46% to 10.3 million homes open for sale as the end of June. And DSL is holding its own, especially when you recognize that between 20% and 25% of the FiOS gross adds are DSL migrations. The positive implications are twofold.  One we are taking market share from cable and two we are successfully up selling FiOS to our existing broadband customers. From a FiOS deployment perspective we passed an additional 650,000 homes in the quarter which puts us at 13.8 million in total. We are on track to be substantially with the deployment by the end of 2010 which has positive implications for both capital spending and free cash flow.  We are very pleased with our progress in FiOS. The financial model is working; consumers recognize it as a high quality service that is superior to anything in the market today. There is plenty of marketing buzz and demand is strong. The key point here is that we\u2019ve been able to replicate the operational and financial success we experienced in the smaller early markets like Texas, across our newer and larger markets like the Potomac region which includes Virginia, and Maryland.  Our increased scale is driving revenue growth, higher ARPUs, and improving margins. We continue to enhance the customer value proposition by introducing new features and functions which further differentiate FiOS in the marketplace. Examples include faster upstream and down stream internet connection speeds, our localized FiOS one news and information channel, which is available in certain markets, and interactive applications which allow customers to interact with sites like Facebook and Twitter while watching TV. Let\u2019s turn next to the rest of the wireline revenues which include global enterprise and wholesale. When I look at the large enterprise business markets, I think there are four notable trends effecting both retail and wholesale revenues.  First as I mentioned earlier we continue to see year over year growth in strategic services particularly global IP. Second, the cumulative effect of unemployment is clearly impacting usage volumes. Third, delayed decision making on the part of CIO\u2019s is adversely effecting IT spending and CPE sales, and fourth, negative foreign exchange currency effects continue to impact year over year revenue comparisons.  From an operational perspective we continue to compete very well. We have not lost any major customers and we\u2019ve been successful in terms of new contracts with some good wins this quarter. So we\u2019re encouraged by that.  Longer-term the continued shift to private IP and managed services is creating global opportunities for companies like us. We are very focused on positioning ourselves to capture our share of these opportunities when the economy improves.  In June we introduced a very comprehensive on demand cloud based computing as a service solution for enterprise customers. This service which leverages our global IP infrastructure and data centers will help business and government agencies be more efficient and securely manage IT resources in a very cost effective manner. We expect a great deal of interest from many of our enterprise customers, particularly in this resource constrained environment.  So on the wireline side we have good growth with FiOS and IP services offset by cyclical impacts in business. We are focused on trying to mitigate these impacts on our profitability although we realistically expect these pressures to continue throughout the second half of the year.  So to quickly sum up, our second quarter and first half performance reflects good operational execution in the key strategic areas. Our balance sheet is healthy and will continue to improve over the next few years as we pay down wireless debt. We are very focused on our cost structure and believe there are significant opportunities to reduce costs over the next couple of years.  Our cash outlook is strong and will allow us to continuing investing for growth while improving our capital efficiency and paying attractive dividend creating value for shareholders. We are making good progress on the strategic front both in terms of the continued integration of the Alltel properties, and in preparation for the divestiture of the wireline properties to Frontier.  Lastly we recognize the impacts the current economy is having on the business and we are focused on ways to offset these effects. And with that we are ready for your questions. \nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Barden - BAS-ML\nDavid Barden - BAS-ML: Two if I may on wireless pricing, first at the higher end of the market, as you are about to deploy LTE data services this year and then more broadly next year, how do you think about the pricing model and preserving the revenue contribution you\u2019re getting today from the 3G service set. Are you expecting people to spend up or how do you plan to preserve the value that you\u2019ve created in 3G [overlaying] this product, and then at the lower end, obviously there\u2019s been a tremendous amount of focus on your partnership with TrakPhone, some have theorized that it\u2019s a Trojan horse to destabilize the market at the lower end and as part of a broader strategy there, could you talk through how you\u2019re thinking about that relationship and what its intended to accomplish and where it stands today. \nJohn Killian : I\u2019ll start with the front end on the LTE and then Denny will hit the TrakPhone part of it, we\u2019re very early days obviously on LTE. We\u2019re doing our trials this year. We\u2019ve talked about deploying next year to 30 markets, 100 million pops roughly. A lot of the pricing that we will have out in the marketplace initially will be on our broadband access kinds of offerings.  It will very much follow the kind of pricing structure that we have in place today. We\u2019ll be 12 months down road when we\u2019re, in a much bigger rollout there. So we\u2019ll continue to monitor the market. The other thing with LTE though, there are a range of other applications, machine to machine, kinds of things.  So pricing structures for that will evolve as we go through the next 12 months. \nDenny Strigl : I like your Trojan horse strategy, but frankly that wasn\u2019t our intent. So we know investors have been interested in TrakPhones\u2019 introduction of the product that they call Straight Talk. And we\u2019re not here to disclose the terms and conditions of the contract that we have with any of our partners, but I will address some of the broader issues of the TrakPhone arrangement.  First of all I think that we\u2019ve been very consistent in our comments that our key focus has been and will continue to be on the retail postpaid market and there is no change in that strategy. That doesn\u2019t mean however that we\u2019ll ignore the prepaid or our reseller partners. The second point that I would make is that we\u2019ll always look for opportunities to capture share on a profitable basis but we wouldn\u2019t do that by cannibalizing our own postpaid base. So our TrakPhone agreement is consistent with the points that I\u2019ve just made. Of course TrakPhone decides on the retail price that it enters the market with and the use of the Verizon wireless brand on the packaging of that product is an experiment or a trial if you will.  Its too early to say if the licensing of the use of the brand will continue. It\u2019s a six month trial and we have the flexibility to pull the brand name at any time. So as I said, I won\u2019t disclose any specific terms or pricing, but you can assume that our contracts are designed to provide flexibility and periodic opportunities to evaluate performance and make any adjustments that we feel may be necessary.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi: Just two questions, first I was wondering if you can give us a sense of where the Alltel synergies stand in dollars, I realize its early, but as of the second quarter that would be great. The second question is if I look at the wireline business the primary line loss improved it looks like roughly 100,000 year over year in the second quarter and I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about that trend a little bit more in the sense of is it a gross add versus churn issue, and is it a FiOS versus non-FiOS market issue and give us maybe a little bit more color as to what\u2019s driving that and whether this is something we should expect to see in the future. \nJohn Killian : On the Alltel synergy side we\u2019re making very good progress here on the Alltel synergies. We have converted a couple of, two out of the four regions, to our billing systems now. That has gone extremely well. Signage, stores, all of that is progressing along the way. As you remember we said first full year would be somewhere in the range of $500 to $600 million of expense synergies.  We still feel very good about those numbers, very confident on that. What I would tell you is in the first half of the year we\u2019ve realized about 25% to 30% of that synergy level so there will be more of an up tick as we get into the second half of the year on benefit. Likewise our [inaudible] will also go up on the capital side related to Alltel integration.  On the access line side, we clearly do see a benefit as we get FiOS out more into the marketplace. Our performance in non-FiOS areas is not quite as good as the FiOS side so the success we\u2019re having with FiOS is helping us on the access line side.  We do have tremendous attention on non-FiOS areas also from a management and performance perspective.\nDenny Strigl : And if I could just add to what John has said here, we often get the question concerning cable competition in small business and so my comment addresses that small business market in particular. So we are seeing an economic impact and some shift to wireless. We think that we\u2019re holding share and there has been I guess I would call it at this point limited impact due to cable competition but we\u2019ll monitor that closely.  We\u2019re focusing on our marketing message to small business customers. We\u2019re making sure the accounts that we have are covered with the proper level of sales team coverage. And similar to what John mentioned extending FiOS to multi tenant units for small business customers is certainly in our game plan. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nSimon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley: You talked about accelerating cost reduction plans in the wireline space, can you give us a sense of what the timing on that will in terms of the heads coming out, has that started already, will that start, go through Q3 so you\u2019ll really see a bigger impact in Q4 then in Q3 and then if you could help us understand a little bit more where you are in understanding the capital spending associated with rolling out LTE.\nJohn Killian : The force reductions and the expense reductions that I mentioned in the wireline business and for backdrop here is I really said over the next 12 to 18 months we will have a lot of attention, we have in the past, but we will really be accelerating our attention on the cost side of the equation particularly in the wireline business.  But force is starting to go off as we speak. A good size of the force reductions will occur in the third quarter. There will be some also in the fourth quarter. I had mentioned that if you look at the wireline side of the business over the last 12 months we reduced the force by about 8,000 in total. We\u2019ll do at least that in the second half of the year when you look at force and contractors and candidly we\u2019re looking at all other areas of expense also. \nDenny Strigl : On your LTE question, maybe it would be helpful if I just clarified our current game plan with LTE, so we plan to conduct LTE trials in Seattle and in Boston later this year. We\u2019re working on a launch of commercial LTE services in up to 30 markets next year. Our plan is to cover 100 million pops. In 2011 and 2012, we\u2019ll continue to expand significantly with the ultimate goal being to cover all of our pops with this great product by the end of 2013.  The financial impact of LTE this year I would call no specific bubble in our numbers. It\u2019s a very small amount. Next year we will be spending on LTE. We haven\u2019t made public that amount but I will tell you that its no significant addition on top of our planned capital budget for the wireless group. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik \u2013 UBS\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Just a quick follow-up to that, the cost reductions that you have planned for the second half, do you think there\u2019ll be enough to sort of arrest the sequential decline we\u2019ve seen in wireline margins or do we have to wait for a turn in the economy and an improvement in the business market for that to either stabilize or start heading in the right direction. And then secondly on broadband you had a strong broadband quarter, can you just talk about the trend you\u2019re seeing in that business. Were there new promotions that were driving it or is it just a function of strength that you saw in the overall FiOS growth. \nJohn Killian :  On the margin side of the business the cost efforts that we will have in the second half of the year will certainly help on the margin side continuing to get further down the path with FiOS will also help. That being said we are facing still the cyclical pressures that are effecting our enterprise, our small business and our wholesale side of the house.  So we\u2019ll really have to see how that plays out. We have a lot of attention on margin as I talked about on the front end here on the expense side. There are a number of things we\u2019re also doing on the FiOS side including we have a price increase going in for new customers and customers that will be coming out of contract so that will also help us from that perspective. \nDenny Strigl : On the broadband growth side, let me first say that we have been focused on keeping our DSL customers and probably more in this last six months then we had in the past, very focused on the packages that we provide and making sure that our customers understand that they\u2019re important and that we do have a good DSL product.  Now, let me comment a bit, I think you may know some of this, in terms of the promotions that we had in the second quarter for FiOS. So we have three triple play packages, good, better, best. Our prices range from $99.99 to $134.99. That is before the premium add-ons that we offer.  As you move from good to best, you get higher internet speeds for example, good generally comes with 15/5 speeds and we have areas with 35/20 speeds in our best packages. TV adds, additional channels for our customers. Additional high definition channels and premium channels. A very competitive offering I think you all know.  We\u2019re currently offering a netbook or camcorder for customers who sign up for the better and best offers. The netbook is about a $300 value and we send the customer a voucher after they\u2019ve been with us for 90 days which they can send to Compaq for the computer. They pay the shipping and handling cost of about $45 to $55. If an existing FiOS customer adds internet or TV, they can get the camcorder free or for $99 they can get the netbook and I think as you know we change our promotional offers periodically. And the current offer should end with, in another couple of weeks and we\u2019ll come to market with yet an additional offer.  So we\u2019ve been very aggressive in going after both FiOS and keeping our DSL customers. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs\nJason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Couple of questions on wireless and maybe a follow-up on the wholesale strategy and maybe specifically just how we should think about the modeling of this from a margin perspective, maybe specifically is this a segment where you\u2019re requiring at least retail like EBITDA margins in order to facilitate resellers on the network. And then second question just on wireless, a number of competitive handset offerings surfacing late in the quarter whether it\u2019s the new iPhone, the Palm Pre, etc., obviously they surfaced in more the June timeframe which seems to raise the risk profile a little bit as you\u2019re exiting the quarter. Can you step us through the trends and maybe speak to the exit rates you saw. \nJohn Killian : When we look at the reseller line of business as well as our prepaid side, clearly we\u2019re very conscious of what the margin contribution is. We\u2019re also very conscious as Denny mentioned earlier of, with our prime strategy being the postpaid side, not risking the cannibalization of that postpaid stream. So we have tremendous attention around the margin levels. We don\u2019t provide information in terms of what kind of margin levels we\u2019re driving on the postpaid side, the retail side versus the wholesale side. But let it just suffice to say it is an area of focus for us. On the reseller channel you don\u2019t have the marketing expenses, you don\u2019t have the cost of acquisition. It hasn\u2019t been a big impact on us either if you look in the second quarter, not a lot of [ads] on the reseller side. \nDenny Strigl : You can expect to see a steady stream of attractive devices coming from Verizon wireless, for example we launched the Blackberry Tour on July 12. We plan to refresh the Storm later this year. Android is on our roadmap. We have Motorola devices that are coming and we plan to offer the Palm Pre early next year and we have continued excellent relationship with LG and Samsung.  So yes, we do have a great device lineup. By the way they\u2019re in the market today. They only improve going forward and we feel very good about that. \nJason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Just asking more about competitive offerings that you saw, the churn results seemed better than I think we and most people were expecting, that was a positive surprise. Can you talk to the trends within the quarter, I think the [bear case] here might be that June maybe there was a little bit more pressure then the other months just related to the competitive offerings. Can you speak to that. \nJohn Killian : On the churn side, Lowell and his team have a lot of focus around churn. We improved sequentially from the first quarter up slightly from the same quarter a year ago. Most of that candidly was driven by impacts on the business side, broadband access, loss of employment, those kinds of things. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan\nMike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan: Maybe to circle back on Jason\u2019s questions real quickly, just on the iPhone impact, of 3GS the $99 iPhone, are you seeing any significant differences this time as opposed to when they rolled out the first 3G phone last July and then secondly on the enterprise side, obviously the economy is having an impact there, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s not also some more aggressive behavior by some of the competitors whether it\u2019s the small, medium sized opportunities or even at the large side, getting more aggressive on price trying to take obviously tougher share. \nDenny Strigl : I understood Jason\u2019s question also, so let me hit the iPhone head on here. So clearly the iPhone has been a successful device which for us has expanded the overall smart phone market. It has had an impact on our reporting ratio. We\u2019re still competing successfully in the marketplace and we\u2019ll continue to do so.  I think that the lineup that I mentioned, the pipeline of products we have coming I think leave us in a strong position. Yes we did see an up tick in the last couple of weeks of June, no question about that. But I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned going forward. \nJohn Killian : On the enterprise side of the business we would really point to the cyclical impacts, what\u2019s happening with employment, particularly the loss of employment. We\u2019re not losing business to be candid with you to competitors. If anything we are positive in terms of new customer contracts, very strong retention with the existing customers.  We think we\u2019re very well positioned for when the economy turns around, employment starts to turn around. Fran Shammo who runs that business and his team has had tremendous focus around cost as we\u2019ve gone through this downturn and trying to minimize any impacts on margin as we go through here.  So competitive activity really hasn\u2019t been the issue as it relates to us. Its been much more the economy and employment. \nMike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan: How would you characterize the pricing environment, unchanged.\nJohn Killian : I think it is. I think we talked about on the last quarter call that we had seem some stabilization which we think is important. I think we continue to see that to be quite candid with you right now. So I wouldn\u2019t say the pricing environment has been a big negative this quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris King \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus\nChris King \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Just wanted to get your thoughts on a couple of the recent developments in Washington, you have been fairly proactive on a couple of issues, handset exclusivity, and roaming being two of them. Just was wondering what your initial feedback that you were getting from Washington on those steps that you have a take in and how you view the environment seems to have turned to be a little bit more aggressive going up against the large Telcos in the US, just wanted to get your thought process on that and what you see over the course of the next six to 12 months that\u2019s kind of impacting the Washington environment. \nDenny Strigl : On the handset exclusivity piece, so we did announce a six month handset exclusivity limit so we were attempting or are attempting to be proactive there. Any new exclusivity arrangements we enter with handset makers will last no longer than six months for all manufacturers and all devices, exclusivity arrangements, we strongly believe do promote competition and innovation in device development and design.  So our take here is is that this approach is fair to all sides. When you think about what Apple has done in bringing the iPhone into the marketplace it truly has accelerated innovation and as we talk to all of our manufacturers everybody has come out with their own iconic device and I think that this has been very good overall for our customers.  Relative to what we read about the DOJ review, if the DOJ conducts an investigation, we think that they\u2019ll find a track record of vigorous competition. It has always been that way in the wireless business. We, Verizon Wireless, has demonstrated over and over again our dedication to competition on the merits of our products, our services, our prices. I also think the record shows that the wireless and wireline markets overall in the US are extremely competitive at this point with many new players in the marketplace. Relative to roaming we work out roaming agreements with carriers on a carrier by carrier basis and I will tell you that we work very hard to make sure our roaming agreements are fair.  We feel that we have a very good track record and a strong position. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer]\n[Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer]: On the TrakPhone deal I\u2019m assuming that the pricing that you\u2019re offering is multiyear other than the brand name, would this be considered a [more] multiyear agreement. And I know on some of the television advertising that you also use, talk about America\u2019s most reliable network or best network, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s part of the contract or not of the six month trial, and then secondly if you could give us a quick update on Frontier, how is the process going and maybe what are the main regulatory concerns. \nJohn Killian : On the Frontier piece let me start with that, we filed the S-4 on Friday, so we\u2019re starting to get into a period where we\u2019re limited on how much we can say. We\u2019ve made all of the regulatory filings so we\u2019re making all the progress we need to make there. We think Maggie and the Frontier team have done a very good job speaking about the transaction and we think everything is going quite well from that perspective.  On the TrakPhone piece here, yes it is a multiyear agreement in terms of pricing and those kinds of things. From a branding as Denny mentioned earlier it\u2019s a six month trial and we have the ability to pull that earlier if we chose to. I\u2019m not sure myself about the, America\u2019s network piece of it. \nDenny Strigl : To be honest I\u2019m not sure, we\u2019ll look into that and get back to you on that. The only other piece I would add is we do strike multiyear contracts with our resellers. \n[Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer]: Could you just about maybe what the main regulatory concerns were going through the Frontier process, the conversations you\u2019ve had. \nJohn Killian : I think I\u2019m limited in how much I can say but I think you know what they are. Its continued investment in those particular territories as they get spun out would probably be at the top of the list. As always, quality of service, those kinds of things would also be there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie\nPhil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie:  Just a quick follow-up on Tim\u2019s, on the wholesale side, are you telling us you have no ability to pull back the pricing the TrakPhone has put out there, that it\u2019s a multiyear contract and you don\u2019t have any control on them essentially offering a 60% discount on your service. And second the inventories I noticed were up pretty substantially sequentially, you talked about free cash flow plan, but is there anything in particular that\u2019s ramping up on the inventory side because we had talked with Doreen back in January and she was talking about set top boxes and handsets both down by quite a bit. \nJohn Killian : Let me hit the cash flow and inventory, we have tremendous focus on cash from ops and free cash flow. We had very good growth, 12% growth in cash from operations, 43% growth in free cash flow. We also have focus to be honest on all balance sheet items, working capital. The issue in the quarter was, you are right, we had some inventory buildup. That was principally as we get into the third quarter on the wireless side.  It was stocking for the Storm and some of the other new devices. We\u2019re very comfortable with those levels there. We\u2019ll continue to work that off as we go through the year. But that\u2019s really what drove that. Seasonally in the second quarter, receivable balances if you look back at time, go up a bit. It all has to do with billing cycles and those kinds of things.  So we\u2019re not at all uncomfortable with the inventory level or what\u2019s happening from a working capital perspective. \nDenny Strigl : So back to the TrakPhone agreement and I think that I mentioned that we don\u2019t disclose any specific terms or the pricing that we offer to resellers. You can be assured that the contract does provide flexibility and opportunities to make adjustments as necessary including pulling the brand name. No to your point on the pricing with which TrakPhone enters the market, we have nothing to do with that. That is strictly TrakPhone\u2019s prerogative and not something that we would ever interfere with. \nPhil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie: On the inventory side, you mentioned that there was stocking for the Storm, it seems like that\u2019s not going to launch for quite a while\u2014\nJohn Killian : No, if I said the Storm, let me correct myself, the Tour, the Blackberry Tour that just came out in July. That was one of the issues plus the back to school season. Historically we go up on inventory in the third quarter. We went up a little bit more this year. That really was tied to the Tour introduction that I think Denny mentioned on July 12.\nRon Lataille: I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Denny for some concluding comments. \nDenny Strigl : Thank you Ron and thanks everybody for your questions this morning. I have just a few comments before we close this call. First, these are challenging times but we stay focused on our strategy of growing revenues, taking share, and improving profitability in each of our business units. The state of the economy may be more difficult now, or make it more difficult in the short-term but we will try to offset the negative impacts as much as possible by doing what we do best and that is managing and reducing cost and being disciplined about our capital expenditures.  Second, I think we\u2019re in a good position to quickly take advantage of the recovery when it does develop. Our customer relationships remain very strong. We continue to rank high in customer satisfaction surveys in wireless and in FiOS and JD Power and Associates just ranked Verizon business highest in customer satisfaction among large enterprise customers, I might point out for both data and voice services.  So eventually pent up demand will result in improved top line numbers and improving margins and finally, we\u2019ll continue to take steps that will enable future growth. A good example here is in our wireless company. We\u2019ll continue to combine the industry\u2019s best spectrum and LTE technology to give us an advantage in speed, coverage, capacity, and cost.  And we\u2019ll leverage these network capacities with products that realize 4G\u2019s potential. John mentioned the Developer Conference tomorrow which will help us create a robust application store and developer community. We\u2019ll also be announcing tomorrow an innovative partnership to provide some advanced services and tap into some significant market opportunities ahead of us in the wireless business.  So although the short-term may be challenging, we believe we have the solid growth opportunities ahead of us and I\u2019ll conclude just once again by thanking you for joining us this morning."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2009, "date": "2009-04-27 16:05:56", "content": "Executives:  Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President Investor Relations John F. Killian - Chief Financial Officer Denny Strigl - President and Chief Operating Officer\nAnalysts: John Hodulik \u2013 UBS Michael Rollins - Citigroup David Barden - BAS-ML Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Tom Seitz - Barclays Capital Mike McCormack - J.P. Morgan Christopher King - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.\nOperator:  Good morning and welcome to the Verizon first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your conference host, Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: [Inaudible] our 2009 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning.  I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. Next I'd like to quickly cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter reported earnings per diluted share were $0.58. Adjusted earnings per share before the effects of special items were $0.63. The $0.05 per share difference is due to the exclusion of certain merger integration costs and acquisition-related charges due to their nonrecurring and/or non-operational nature. These specific income statement line item effects are detailed in the reconciliation table. Merger integration costs totaled $50 million after tax or $0.02 per share. Acquisition-related charges totaled $96 million after tax or $0.03 per share. This includes transaction costs and nonrecurring finance fees associated with the bridge loan. The finance fees include upfront and duration fees amortized over the life of the loan.  I would also point out that the amortization expense related to customer lists is not part of the special items that we've normalized from adjusted results. This represented a little more than $0.01 of EPS in the quarter and should be about $0.05 for the full year.  Before turning the call over to John, I'd like to make sure that you are aware that for purposes of comparability and modeling future performance we have made available on our website historical pro forma financial and metric information for the Alltel acquisition, historical Wireline revenue under the new reporting classification, and a required financial statement presentation change due to the adoption of FAS No. 160, Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.  With that I will now turn the call over to John Killian.\nJohn F. Killian: Thanks, Ron, and good morning to everyone.  Before I get into the review of first quarter's results I would like to provide a few opening comments. First, I would like to offer my congratulations and best wishes to Doreen Toben as she soon enters retirement. The CFO baton was passed to me less than two months ago, but I can tell you that I intend to build on the strong foundation she helped create. Like Doreen, I will be very focused on continuing Verizon's strong legacy of financial discipline, transparent reporting, stringent control requirements, and prudent risk management.  One of my first priorities as CFO was to review the business plan in detail and ensure that I can help the business achieve not only this year's financial and operating targets but also the long-term goal of sustainable value creation for shareholders. As a member of Ivan's leadership council for the last few years, I can tell you that the executive team has never been more optimistic about the outlook of the business. Everyone recognizes the current economic challenges, but we remain confident in our ability to execute and to compete well. In fact, I think our first quarter results prove this point.  We're also focused on improving shareholder value. As I reviewed the business plan and talked to business unit heads about their opportunities and challenges, it's clear to me that the investments in strategic changes we have made over the last several years have positioned us well for the future. It is also clear to me that we need to transition from building a competitive advantage to a model that more closely links this competitive advantage with strong and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow.  I understand that you as shareholders and prospective shareholders look for Verizon to be a market leader and to demonstrate financial and operational stability and strength. My goal as CFO is to enhance business performance and shareholder value. I feel strongly that Verizon's ability to grow cash flow and deliver a competitive dividend is an important vehicle for generating shareholder returns over the long term. As you know, it is our policy not to provide point estimate guidance on earnings and other key metrics. We believe it's more important to help investors identify the key drivers and how management thinks about growth and total shareholder returns.  For example, at a conference in January Ivan discussed the outlook for 2009 and highlighted some of the headwinds expected from the economy and pension plan performance. But he felt that we were well positioned in the market and despite the headwinds we could see some earnings growth this year, and we're off to a good start in the first quarter.  From a total shareholder returns perspective, management's goal was to provide shareholders consistent returns in the low double digits, driven by both earnings growth and a commitment to a strong and growing dividend. So as I look at current results, the business plan, capital allocation and potential M&A I will be asking: Are we creating value for shareholders and, if so, by how much? Are our actions and plans accretive to earnings and cash flow? Which areas of the business are creating value and which are not? What are the plans to improve performance in areas that are not meeting certain thresholds? And how would alternative strategic plans benefit shareholder value? The key drivers are obvious - revenue growth, profit margins and capital investments - and in the end how they generate returns and cash flow. Looking at our Wireless business, we'll maintain our approach of balancing growth and profitability. Alltel gives us a great opportunity and I think a very visible and achievable opportunity to drive Verizon's wireless's industry leading performance throughout the Alltel properties, improving penetration and driving free cash flow. We are also focused on achieving our synergy targets; in fact, we should realize about $1 billion in expense savings by the end of next year.  Verizon Wireless is a great asset, which will continue grow and generate substantial increases in free cash flow. The move to LTE over the next several years will only strengthen our position in the marketplace and establish a new platform for growth with no significant increases or bubble in CapEx. The value creation for this business is strong, with revenue continuing to grow nicely, coupled with productivity improvements producing consistent double-digit growth in free cash flow. In Wireline, our strategic investments have helped drive improvement in the top line, but I am also committed to driving improvement in margins over the next several years. We all know that there are secular changes impacting access lines, there are cyclical impacts on the business sector from the economy, and recently market returns will affect non-cash pension and OPEB costs. All of these issues are reflected in our current margin results; however, we still have work to do to restructure and optimize the Wireline portfolio. Our Wireline segment continues to be focused on shifting our center of gravity to the growing broadband, video and global IT markets. Our goal is to continue to improve EBITDA margins in this business.  We are not standing still and will not stand still. We are taking numerous actions to improve performance, including an unrelenting focus on maximizing the value of FiOS in our targeted upgrade areas. This includes focusing as much on efficiency and productivity as penetration, similar to how we manage the Wireless business - driving synergies in our newly formed Wireline network organization, which integrates the network organizations of Verizon Telecom and Verizon Business, increasing the mix of global enterprise revenue from higher margin strategic services, continuing to look at rationalizing our access line business, especially in non-FiOS areas through strategic alternatives, and lastly, continuing to resize our cost structure in all areas of the business.  The last area I want to touch upon is capital allocation and efficiency. We are focused on lowering the level of capital expenditures over the next several years. The key drivers here include the completion of our 18 million homes passed for FiOS, synergies from the consolidation of Wireline networks, and scale economies, network optimization and cost avoidance resulting from the acquisition of Alltel. The savings from these initiatives will more than offset Alltel integration capital requirements and the depreciation of LTE. Our 2009 first quarter CapEx results demonstrate our focus here. This will fuel our growth in free cash flow. As we pay down the debt related to Alltel over the next two to three years, debt-to-EBITDA should return to about 1.3 times level.  I hope this provides you with a sense of how I see the business and my assessment of how we plan to drive shareowner value. Now let's go through the details of the first quarter. As I said, I believe our results show that we're off to a good start. First quarter adjusted earnings were $0.63 per share, up 3.3% both sequentially and year-over-year.  Cash flow from operations was a very strong $6.4 billion, up 19% compared with the first quarter last year.  Capital spending for the quarter was $3.7 billion, which is lower than our run rate trend but consistent with our planned conservative start to the year.  Our strong cash flow performance, coupled with lower capital spending, resulted in $2.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter, which was $1.5 billion more than a year ago, so cash generation looks to be very healthy and our capital efficiency is certainly improving. Our network investment strategy is paying off, and I can assure you that we will continue to be disciplined in terms of how we allocate and spend capital to maximize free cash flow.  Net debt is obviously higher as a result of the Alltel acquisition and was $65.2 billion or about 1.8 times pro forma EBITDA for the last 12 months. Subsequent to drawing the $12.35 billion bridge loan to close the transaction in early January we issued $4.25 billion of three and five-year notes, with the proceeds being applied against the bridge facility. We also paid down a portion of the loan with VZW free cash flow. As a result, the balance on the bridge loan now stands at $5.9 billion.  Our cash flow outlook provides us with the financial strength to fund our capital program, reduce debt, and return value to shareholders with a very competitive dividend.  Turning to Slide 4, let's take a look at consolidated revenue and margins. The inclusion of Alltel increased consolidated revenues to $26.6 billion, up 12.8% compared with first quarter last year. On a pro forma basis revenue growth was 3.3% year-over-year, driven by top line increases in all strategic areas. Consolidated operating income of $4.9 billion grew 11.7% year-over-year, driven by the inclusion of Alltel. On a pro forma basis we were able to hold operating income stable in spite of the cyclical challenges in parts of the Wireline business.  We remain sharply focused on cost controls, with the objective of driving efficiencies to offset business volume declines. As I go through the segments, you'll see this operating and financial discipline. Let's start with Wireless.  In Wireless our first quarter results once again demonstrate the effectiveness of our continued focus on the retail postpaid market, the strength of our network, products and services and customer service, all of which contribute to our industry leading customer loyalty and profitability.  Of course, what really sets Verizon Wireless apart is its ability to generate significant cash flow. Total revenues for the quarter were $15.1 billion, up 29.6% from a year ago. On a pro forma basis total revenues were up $1.25 billion or 9%, while service revenue grew 10.5%.  I should point out that the properties were are required to divest are fully included in our Wireless results and will be until they are sold.  EBITDA topped the $6 billion mark this quarter, up 32.2% from a year ago. On a pro forma basis, EBITDA growth was 12.2%. The EBITDA margin on service revenue was 46%. Wireless capital spending was $1.6 billion in the first quarter, again, a bit lower than last year. And our capital efficiency continues to improve, now in the 10% range. At this point we have not done a lot of integration spending on the capital side beyond billing systems work, but this will pick up as the year progresses.  So our top and bottom line Wireless results continue to demonstrate our ability to consistently achieve both growth and profitability at the same time. Let's take a closer look at the drivers of Wireless revenue growth on the next slide. Total service revenues grew to $13.1 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Total service ARPU had pro forma growth of 1.1% in the quarter, continuing our strong track record of year-over-year accretion. Nearly 80% of the growth in service revenue was driven by wireless data, which was up 36.8% compared with the first quarter a year ago on a pro forma basis.  Total data ARPU grew to $14.16, up 25% year-over-year and wireless data represented 27.9% of total service revenue in the first quarter. The main drivers of this growth continue to be e-mail, broadband access and usage, and messaging. Revenue from non-messaging data services now represents 58% of total Wireless data revenue. Non-messaging data revenues grew 47% on a pro forma basis in the first quarter.  PDA and smart phone sales remain strong and the good news here, of course, is that ARPU, particularly the data component, is significantly higher with these devices. We believe that wireless data, which totaled $12.2 billion on a pro forma basis in 2008 will continue to be a significant driver of revenue growth.  In the first quarter pro forma growth was just under $1 billion year-over-year. We see plenty of near-term upside and expect that the proliferation of new devices in the pipeline, like smart phones and netbooks, will stimulate both interest and demand for increased wireless data usage.  Our leadership in the deployment of LTE will incent application and device developers to create product and service capabilities that will dramatically expand the overall market potential for next-generation data technologies. As you know, we've already selected the key infrastructure partners and we intend to have a few commercially ready markets up by the end of 2009, with an objective of provide commercial service in 25 to 30 markets in 2010.  Our open development program is going very well and we expect the number of new devices and applications to significantly increase once we've deployed 4G. And we've announced plans to open the Verizon Wireless LTE Innovation Center later this year, which will provide an environment for testing, prototyping and trialing new LTE products and concepts.  Taking a look at customer results, we turned in another very strong quarter of high-quality customer growth - 1.3 million net adds, essentially all retail. Nearly 1 million net adds were postpaid and about 300,000 were prepaid. We ended the quarter with a total of 86.6 million customer, 91% of which were retail postpaid. We have 5.2 million prepaid customers and about 2.5 million customers from resellers. Retail gross adds this quarter were up 4.3% on a pro forma basis compared with first quarter last year.  Our total churn rate of 1.47 was up 16 basis points compared with a year ago pro forma. On the same basis, retail postpaid churn was up 15 basis points to 1.14. The reasons for the uptick are similar to what we observed last quarter - predominantly broadband access PC cards and additional line disconnects in small business.  Clearly, we feel very good about the competitiveness of our Wireless business. Our operating and financial performance is resulting in strong revenue growth, improving profitability and substantial cash flow generation. The Alltel integration process is going very well, with no surprises, and we are aggressively pursuing synergy opportunities. With great experience integrating wireless assets, we have confidence in our ability to execute and capitalize on the strategic benefits of this acquisition.  Let's move to Wireline next. In spite of the macroeconomic environment and the cyclical challenges in the business markets, I'd say that the consumer market is holding up very well and overall we've made good progress improving our competitive position. Consumer revenue is growing. Broadband and video services now comprise more than one-third of consumer revenue. Our strong operating momentum in FiOS will continue to provide us with a great opportunity to drive both customer and revenue growth.  In the global enterprise and wholesale markets we are seeing the cyclical effects of unemployment on business volumes, delayed decision-making on the part of some large business customers, and some negative foreign exchange currency effects.  The Wireline EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 25.1%. As expected higher pension and OPEB expenses contributed to the decline.  Let's take a closer look at revenues, starting with mass markets. Mass markets includes revenue from consumer and small-medium business, with the exception of the former MCI mass markets, which we now classify as other.  The majority of the revenues are in the consumer market, where FiOS, broadband and video services continue to drive revenue and ARPU growth. In the first quarter consumer revenues grew 2% year-over-year. Broadband and video revenues totaled nearly $1.3 billion, representing an increase of 36.3% compared with the first quarter last year. We've also seen consistently strong growth in consumer retail ARPU, which increased to just under $70 this quarter, up 13.7% from a year ago.  Our FiOS customer performance continued its strong momentum, with good results in all markets, a tribute to the strength of our triple-play value proposition in a slowing economy. We had a great quarter, with sequential penetration gains of 210 basis points in TV and 190 basis points in FiOS Internet. We added 299,000 new FiOS TV customers in the quarter, ending with a total of 2.2 million subscribers and a penetration rate of 23%. So in the past 12 months we've added 1 million TV customers and expanded the availability of the FiOS triple play by almost 50%, from 6.5 million homes a year ago to 9.7 million homes open for sale at the end of March.  On the broadband side we added 252,000 new net subscribers in the first quarter, including a record number of 298,000 new FiOS Internet customers. We also saw some sequential improvement in DSL.  We ended the quarter with a total of 2.8 million FiOS Internet subscribers and a penetration rate of 27% based on 10.4 million homes open for sale. From a FiOS deployment perspective we passed an additional 500,000 homes in the quarter, which put us at 13.2 million total, still a bit ahead of schedule. And above 30% of the total households in our footprint can purchase our FiOS triple-play service today. We will continue to expand FiOS triple-play availability as we further expand existing markets and enter new urban markets later this year, like Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia.  On the traditional access line side of the business we saw some stability in the level of retail residential primary line losses, which were 462,000 this quarter. Total switched access lines declined by 964,000.  Let's turn next to the rest of the Wireline revenues, starting with global enterprise revenue. Revenue for the first quarter was $3.7 billion, down $133 million or 3.4% year-over-year, which was exaggerated by an unfavorable foreign currency translation, so the revenue decline, excluding FX, was only 1.5%.  Revenue from strategic services, like private IT, managed services and security, grew 7.5% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. Strategic services are becoming a larger portion of the revenue stream.  We continue to take a very disciplined approach in terms of evaluating new sales and profitability, with a sharp focus on controlling our costs and improving incremental margins. We're also looking to increase our professional consulting expertise as a way to further improve the revenue mix toward higher-margin services. We continue to compete very well in terms of new contracts and we had a number of significant customer wins this quarter.  Moving next to our new Wireline revenue category, global wholesale, you can see that revenues were down $243 million or 9.2%. This category has several components. Special access revenues continue to grow based on increasing demands for higher bandwidth. The declining portions of this category are local wholesale, which includes the former UNEP business, switched access, where minutes are used from other carriers have declined, and long-haul transport, domestic and international, where volumes are down.  So in terms of our overall Wireline business, we continue to believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in both the consumer and business markets. Broadband and video revenues now comprise one-third of consumer revenue. FiOS is going very well, both operationally and financially, and will continue to provide us a great opportunity to drive growth and improve profitability. In the enterprise space, the continued shift to private IP and minutes services is creating global growth opportunities. There are clearly some cyclical pressures in the business markets, but we are focused on operating and financial discipline, driving changes in our cost structure to offset volume declines. So to quickly sum up and get to your questions, I'd reiterate that we're off to a great start. Our first quarter performance reflects solid execution and demonstrates both operating and financial discipline as we delivered revenue, earnings and cash flow growth in a challenging environment. Our focus on cost controls and disciplined capital spending resulted in an increase in free cash flow of $1.5 billion compared with a year ago, and I can assure you that we will continue to exercise discipline in terms of how we allocate and spend capital to maximize free cash flow. Our network investment strategy is resulting in sustained profitable growth in our key strategic areas. Our growth fundamentals in these areas remain very solid and we certainly have the potential to continue performing well throughout 2009. Our balance sheet is healthy and we are in a strong financial position.  And with that I'll turn it back to you, Ron.\nRon Lataille:\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik \u2013 UBS.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: [Break in audio] and about 45% for the second quarter in a row. Previously you've talked about 43% to 45% as a good range, but going forward, with a lot of the Alltel synergies still ahead of you, can we expect margins to remain above this level going forward? And then a second quick one. There's another article today about Verizon potentially getting access to the iPhone. Is that something that you expect to potentially happen before the conversion to LTE or just any color around that would be great, Denny.\nJohn F. Killian: We're very pleased with our Wireless results in the quarter. Yes, we've had a very strong focus on both growing revenue and cash flow and margins in the business. We grew service revenue in the quarter by 10.5% and we were pleased with the 46% service margin level. From my perspective the EBITDA margin target of 43% to 45% that we've had out there is really no longer that helpful. As you can see, we don't manage exactly to that particular range. We came in at 46%. You are right that we do believe Alltel will give us additional opportunities in the future as we go through this year.  We don't think it makes sense to put out a new range, so I really would just focus on the overall performance in the quarter and you get the strong feeling here that we are very focused on both growth and profitability.  Denny will take the iPhone question.\nDenny Strigl: You know, we have said in the past we're always open to discussion with any suppliers. We have no announcements to make relative to Apple today.  But let me say that we historically have not been dependent on any one device. We're very well positioned with high-value customers. We believe that we have currently a strong handset lineup; you'll see more from us as the year goes on. And smart phones and PDA sales overall in the quarter were very strong at 41% of our direct device sales and at the end of the first quarter we had 19.3 million integrated devices and that's in our core - the VZW base, in other words, not counting what is in Alltel - and, of course, those integrated devices are PDAs, smart phones, other devices with a keyboard and that's double what we had in the same quarter last year.  So, John, a bit more than what you asked for, but we're always to talking to suppliers.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Michael Rollins - Citigroup.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup: First, I was wondering on Wireline side if you could talk a little bit more about the wholesale business in terms of maybe what some of the factors were in the step down of revenue sequentially? And then secondly I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in detail about the opportunities for you to grow margins per your comments earlier in the call on the Wireline side and maybe just give us a sense of some of the key priorities over the next 12 to 18 months as you look to execute on that goal.\nJohn F. Killian: The wholesale business, yes, our revenue performance was down 9.2% in the quarter. FX did affect that. If you adjust out FX, we were down by about 7.4%.  There are several different pieces of this business. We continued to see growth in our special access business in the quarter. The areas of the business where we saw the decline were really twofold. One was a decline we've seen before in the local wholesale business, which is really the UNEP business, so we have a decline in UNEP lines there. We're holding in pretty good on revenue per unit in that business, which is good.  The second one, really, where the bigger impact was was really the carrier side of the business, which is really driven by the economy and long distance minutes in many ways. It's both a domestic and an international business. We did take some decisions, particularly on the international side, where on some of our routes we did do some price increases there. Some of that resulted in volume declines. Now to be quite candid with you, it wasn't very profitable in those particular routes and we were trying to improve the profitability there.  So that gives you a good sense here in terms of the wholesale business. I think Denny's going to add a comment and then we'll come back and talk about the EBITDA margin in the Wireline business.\nDenny Strigl: Well, John, I was going to comment on margin. You're welcome to go ahead, please. I just had a couple of comments for Mike on the Wireline margin.\nJohn F. Killian: So, Mike, we continue to resize the business, reducing our force in areas that are not growing. And if you look, for example, in our traditional telecom business, that is non-FiOS, the work force is down by nearly 13,000 from the end of '07 through the first quarter of this year. We are in the process of consolidating our network organizations across telecom and our business groups and we expect to generate greater efficiency and productivity improvements in network planning and engineering and in our maintenance functions. In addition to that, we look continually for new technologies and training of our force to save us time and gain efficiency.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Barden - BAS-ML.\nDavid Barden - BAS-ML: Just following up on two things real quick, just on data ARPU and kind of the outlook as you see it for this year. I think we heard some comments from AT&T about drivers of slowing data ARPU, revenue growth, corporate liable subscriptions, some price downs, even some talk around the margin potentially of getting to some point of saturation in devices in the base. I think you've given us some new data there. It sounds like you guys are roughly equivalently penetrated. I wonder if you could kind of give us your thoughts about how we should think about the data ARPU trend in the current economic climate? And if I could, just returning to an earlier question on the Wireless margins, I know you guys don't want to give out a target, but philosophically you've got more firepower now from a margin standpoint with the Alltel merger done. Is the objective to focus on the cash flows and the growth year-over-year and bring those margins back to the stockholder or is it to kind of see what opportunities can be derived from deploying that margin back down into the lower 40% to kind of go out and mine the last units of market share out there?\nJohn F. Killian: Let me just start with the second part of the question and then Denny will come back on the data ARPU.  You know, as you can see in the quarter, we drove to a 46% margin. We have always said our focus in this business is to drive both to growth and profitability. We're not going to limit the profitability in the business. We do have more synergies coming in. We also do believe there continues to be growth opportunities out in the marketplace. I said in my opening remarks we're very focused on shareowner returns. We have a very healthy dividend. And we will continue to be focused on that.  We're also, let me just reiterate, very pleased with the cash flow in the quarter. If you look at cash flow from ops, that was up $1 billion year-over-year. With the discipline we had on CapEx, free cash flow was up $1.5 billion. We understand the importance of that and we're not going to lose focus on that.  \nDenny Strigl:  Dave, I guess I would add in this way. As John said in his opening remarks, the data ARPU was a very solid result of $14.16, up 25% year-over-year. We believe going forward that there is more penetration to be mined in data devices. We have a very robust lineup and I think we've got some good upside, particularly with the introduction of LTE and our open development initiative later this year and into next. So I think we have good data upside.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: You talked about the strong CapEx driving free cash flow and I think up to now your guidance has been CapEx down year-over-year before the Alltel impact, but it looks like at the moment at least you're running at a pretty significant year-over-year decline. Now that you've got a little bit more visibility do you think there's an opportunity here for sort of a 10% - 15% drop in CapEx year-over-year? And secondly, on Alltel you talked about $1 billion in synergies by the end of '10. Can you just talk a little bit more about, again, now that you've had a better look at it, what's in Q1 in terms of synergies - roaming and stuff like that - and what should we look at for the rest of '09 to come through from that?\nJohn F. Killian: I'll start with the first part on CapEx and then Denny will hit the second part of your question.  We were pleased with our CapEx performance in the first quarter. We had indicated to everybody that we were going to start off this year in a disciplined fashion. Coming out of the fourth quarter no one knew how bad the economy was going to be so we thought it was prudent for us to do that. So we ran at a $3.7 billion level in the first quarter. If you annualize that you're at $15 billion for the full year. The first quarter isn't representative of the run rate for the full year. Now that being said, we have said before that our intention this year is to bring CapEx as a percent of revenue down and we will continue to be very disciplined as we go through the year. We recognize the importance that that has on our cash flow performance. We also recognize that our business is weathering the economic situation in a very strong fashion, with good growth numbers on both sides of the business, on the FiOS side and on the Wireless side.  So I think you can expect some uptick from the first quarter, but again, if you look at the full year as a percent of revenue, we will be down and we are going to be very disciplined. \nDenny Strigl: So, Simon, then, if I may, I'll comment specifically on your point on roaming and then comment on Alltel in general. So not much roaming in the first quarter. We really have been focused on integration. So in that regard we have found no surprises with Alltel following the acquisition and our integration plans have remained on track. We've targeted synergies. They're visible; they're achievable. And they're in the order of over $9 billion in net present value and John and I are both comfortable with that number. From an operating perspective, our goal is to achieve the expense and the capital synergies as soon as we possibly can, and I think we can have a significant portion of the synergy initiatives in place by the end of this year. And then just a comment regarding the overall integration effort, we're preparing to convert former Alltel customers to our billing system over the next several months and you will see our store and overall signage changes made before the fourth quarter, in time for our holiday season selling.  The bottom line for John and I is that we're on plan and we're where we discussed June of last year and we know how to integrate acquisitions and extract synergies and we're in the process of doing just that.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Tom Seitz - Barclays Capital.\nTom Seitz - Barclays Capital: If I could, Denny, maybe I'll just follow up on the Alltel acquisition for a second.  I know you want to talk about the business as a whole, but can you give us some sort of sense as to what subscriber trends were in the Alltel legacy market? They were running at roughly about a 300,000 net add run rate and I'm wondering was that a little bit lower because you were in the middle of transforming the business to the Verizon platform, a little bit higher because everybody was excited about Verizon? Just sort of some trend there. And then the second question, with respect to strategic services growth you mentioned in the remarks that consulting revenue on the managed platforms is an opportunity that you're looking at. Is that a capability you can build out internally or is this an area that we might expect you to do some sort of acquisition in a bolt-on fashion to add those capabilities?\nDenny Strigl: Tom, I will take the first part of your question. Looking at Alltel and actually looking at our overall results, as we've indicated, we're quite pleased with our Wireless net add results for the quarter. We do not comment specifically on any pieces of either our partners or properties that we've acquired. I would say that overall we've acquired 13.4 million Alltel customers and the Alltel properties grew during the first quarter, primarily all retail. So we feel good about what Alltel has done for us during the quarter. And, Tom, I'm going to leave it at that. \nJohn F. Killian: I'll take the second part. If you think about our enterprise business, as we've always said, it builds off the strength of the global network that we have. We believe we have the leading global IP network in place when you look at, really, the entire world, but we are focused around also building out more and more capability on the higher-margin strategic services. That includes IP; it's network services offering, our IP services.  On the professional services there's a couple of different areas where we have some strength. We did make an acquisition in mid-2007 of a company by the name of Cybertrust, who brought a number of professional service individuals to us with particular expertise in security but also in the IT area. Through some reorganization within the enterprise group we've added to some of those capabilities. It's actually a very good time in the marketplace to get skill sets there. And not really additive to the total force, but as we've changed out some of the force we have had the opportunity.  We also look here to partnerships so, you know, we announced and Denny mentioned late last year or maybe it was the first quarter the relationship with have with Accenture and we will continue to explore other kinds of partnership vehicles to get that done.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Mike McCormack - J.P. Morgan.\nMike McCormack - J.P. Morgan: On the enterprise side, can you give us, John, maybe a little more sense on the trends, maybe domestic versus international, with respect to economic impact - obviously there's an FX impact on your international side - but demand trends and economic trends between those two areas? And then lastly, Wireline D&A took a step back, which it sometimes does, in the first quarter of the year. Is that something we should be building off of for the rest of the year or how should we be looking at that?\nJohn F. Killian: Let me give you a couple of reactions here. Look, the global economy is having an impact on our enterprise business both domestically and outside the United States. Currency clearly had an impact. If you look at our performance, we were down 3.4% year-over-year. If you break out the impact of FX we were down about a point and a half. So, you know, I wouldn't say, Mike, to be honest that outside the U.S. is worse than the U.S. I think we're all kind of suffering right now from the same kind of situation. Now related to that the very good news is our customer relationships are very much intact, so we have not lost them. That's very important for when business comes back because the big driver here clearly is employment. As you're losing jobs, it has some effect on revenue. But as that economy turns our customer relationships are very much intact. We've had no losses and we've actually picked up some new ones. I wouldn't read anything major into the change in the Wireline depreciation. It was up slightly but, as you know, we go through an annual review process here. Our CapEx in '08 was down from the '07 level slightly. Our fiber program, those are longer-lived assets that we're investing in. The copper network's lives have shorted over time, but the remaining life on a lot of that depreciation has also shortened down. So I think we'll run similar to how we have run the last couple of years.\nDenny Strigl: And, John, if I could just add more color for Mike here. On the enterprise side overall, as John indicated, we're still making new sales; a number of wins in the quarter. The economy has slowed down buying decisions overall. And we're not necessarily seeing things get worse during the first quarter; I think I would classify the trends as consistent.  And just one more piece I would say as we have made this point in the past, we're being very disciplined on pricing. We're focused on eliminating costs and, as John has indicated, we're looking very closely at capital expenses.  So I think overall we're well positioned to delivery products and services when the economy starts improving. \nMike McCormack - J.P. Morgan:  I think, Denny, last quarter you guys had made mention that your nearest peer got maybe slightly more aggressive on some areas of pricing. Is that still occurring or has that sort of straightened out? \nDenny Strigl: I have no further comment on that at this point.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Christopher King - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc..\nChristopher King - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: First of all, just a follow up to Mike's question. Assuming then that the enterprise revenue decline year-over-year from an overall demand standpoint is generally usage based just in terms of lower headcount reductions worldwide by some of your customers, I just wanted to clarify that if I could. And then the second question relates to the hub product offering. You guys are obviously putting some more marketing muscle behind that it appears over the course of the last couple of months. I just was wondering if that was a material driver in the quarter of either Wireline churn or Wireless net adds during the first quarter? And then just generally speaking with respect to the hub what your feedback has been from the broader customer base with respect to that product offering? Is it trending in line with your expectations?\nJohn F. Killian: Chris, on your first part of that, which was the usage component, yes, it is minutes of use, it's LD, voice minutes that we're talking about there in particular.  And then Denny will comment on the hub.\nDenny Strigl: Chris, on the hub, yes, we have been aggressive in promoting the hub. It has not been material to what we've been doing in Wireless. We do tend to believe that it is of some modest assistance on churn, but frankly, Chris, it's way too early to tell.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Maybe first on just Wireless ARPU, lots of moving parts here. Can you help us get behind the numbers a bit more, maybe talk about trend rates and smart phone ARPUs versus non-smart phone ARPUs and what elements of ARPU ultimately are proving to be impacted by macro? And then maybe second quarter just on netbooks. You mentioned that upfront as an opportunity. A fair amount of industry buzz around this one. What do you think about sort of the economic model behind netbooks for you? Obviously, this is sort of going to test the economics of high capacity wireless data without really the ability for voice to contribute to the model so, given this, how shall we think about the subsidy model that you'll think about putting around networks?\nDenny Strigl: Jason, if I may, I'll start here and to put your question into perspective, I would first note on the Wireless side, of course, revenues grew, as John mentioned, at 10.5%, so I would say that our Wireless business continues to perform well in a challenging environment.  We do see pockets of pressure due to the economy; I would say more the economy than competition related.  So trying to give you some perspective on the overall ARPU, we continue to see very good growth on the data side. We have no evidence of customers trading down on plans or features. Churn ticked up a bit compared to the prior year, about a 15 basis point increase on postpaid predominantly economy related. And like we said in the fourth quarter, about half of the impact is from broadband access cards, which probably reflects layoffs by many businesses, but broadband access is still growing very nicely. The economy probably has led to seeing some third, fourth, fifth-line disconnects.  On a pro forma basis, as John mentioned, ARPU increased 1.1%. Our data revenue continued to grow at 37%. Our non-messaging revenue increased 47%, so demand is resilient on average and we find that new customers to VZW spend more on services. In fact, on BlackBerry devices we tend to see that the ARPU is around $100. We also believe that Alltel presents us with some data upside. As you may know, Alltel's reported data ARPU was about $4 below the historical Verizon Wireless level, so we think some good upside there.  On netbook, frankly, we have nothing more, Jason, to add. We did say that we would introduce it later this year and as we have more information on it we certainly will let you know.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co..\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.: Denny first, on the wireless data front, I would assume with the PDAs and all the new netbooks coming out that you're seeing some fairly explosive growth on your wireless networks. Can you maybe talk about what that growth rate is year-over-year?  And I guess with non-messaging up over 50% that would translate into a lot more volume growth. Can you handle this continued rate of growth with this level of CapEx spending?  And then, John, maybe with the threshold that you've kind of taking here, where do you think the most opportunity to create stockholder value is with the business? Is it on the M&A front, acquisitions, divestitures, internal restructuring, or do you think it's just going to be kind of more execution on what you have at this point?\nJohn F. Killian: Tim, on the first thought, our Wireless network is in a very good position. We've always prided ourselves as network being our crown jewel of our business. It's holding up very well and is a differentiator for us. So we will continue to invest along the normal lines that we have been doing from a data side. If you look at our data ARPU, we've talked about it, up very nicely. Denny mentioned the opportunity or Alltel. We think there's a great opportunity because of where they were to lift that.  So, you know, on stockholder value, just a couple of thoughts here for you. There's nothing more important than execution, so continuing to build and drive the business day in, day out, and we have great leaders running the different units, so we're in a very good position there.  We've done a lot in the last several years. If I date back, Tim, when I knew you several years ago, obviously the business has changed a lot and that was done intentionally. So our reliance on lower-growth areas of the business, we've taken care of a lot of that, particularly if you think about what we did with the directory business, some of the things we've done on the access line side. So continued strong execution in blocking and tackling; we also recognize how important free cash flow generation is, so there will be a lot of focus around free cash flow generation. \nRon Lataille: [Stacy], I'd now like to turn the call over to Denny for some closing comments.\nDenny Strigl: Okay, Ron, thank you and thank you all for joining us and thank you for your questions.  And let me take just the last couple of minutes here and try to wrap up. As expected, we had some headwinds this quarter, but the results reflect the combination of solid execution and the strength of our consolidated business model. The resilience in our top line growth in this challenging environment reflects both the continuous transition of our business and our focus on key growth markets.  We've evolved to a stronger position over the last few years by investing in our crown jewels - our Wireless network, our FiOS network and our global IP network - and at the same time we have strategically transformed the business. We divested our directories business. We monetized most of our international equity holdings. We sold some access lines and acquired assets that improved our position in the global enterprise and also the Wireless markets.  So if we look at the business overall, 57% of Verizon's total revenue comes from Wireless. And as John discussed, Wireless service revenues grew 10.5% in the first quarter. I would say that we're weathering the effects of the economy very well. And I believe that we also extended our industry leadership position in Wireless, in postpaid subscribers, in revenue growth and also, of course, in margin.  And there are significant opportunities ahead of us with Alltel, with our LTE deployment and our open development initiative, as I mentioned earlier, and we're excited about some of the handsets, software and applications that we'll be introducing later this year. All of this will help deliver solid data growth opportunities for many years to come.  In Wireline our strategy has been to focus on our growth markets, drive continuous cost reductions, especially in our legacy businesses, and therefore to narrow the scope of risk. We've spun off or sold some landline assets and FiOS now covers over 40% of our remaining households; that will grow to over 60% by year end. And looking at the results in the first quarter, consumer retail revenues were up 2% and broadband and video revenue grew by over 30%. Again, this was excellent performance in a challenging economy, but I believe that we can do even better, primarily by focusing on our cost structure or particularly on our cost structure.  On the business side, strategic services grew over 7%. We did, as John indicated, see some cyclical impacts. This market will turnaround and we have the assets and capabilities in place to capitalize on future growth. The other key takeaway today is the framework that John laid out in his opening remarks. We will continue to tap into new opportunities for growth, but at the same time we'll transform our cost structure and leverage our assets to grow shareowner value. John described a business model that is disciplined and focused on balancing the key drivers in growing the top line, cash flow and total shareholder returns. So thank you all very much for joining us on our call today.\nRon Lataille: Okay, that concludes our call today. Thank you, everybody, for joining us."}], "2011": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2010, "date": "2011-01-25 19:05:11", "content": "Executives: Francis Shammo - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Ivan Seidenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chairman of the Verizon Wireless John Doherty - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nAnalysts: Christopher Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley David Barden Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. John Doherty.\nJohn Doherty: Good morning. Welcome to Verizon's Investor Conference. Thanks for joining us here at Cipriani Wall Street, where we are live webcast, where I understand we have an additional 500 plus people that have signed in. We hope you're all as excited as we are to be meeting with you in person, as we end 2010 and kick off 2011. Before we get started, I would like to point out that our fourth quarter earnings release, financial statements, investor quarterly publication and the earnings presentation slides are all currently available on our Investor Relations website. At the conclusion of this morning's meeting, the strategic and financial overview piece will also be posted to the website for your reference and use. All historical information has been adjusted for the effects of the change in the benefit plan accounting that we announced on Friday.  It is my pleasure to be joined this morning by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ivan Seidenberg; our President and Chief Operating Officer, Lowell McAdam; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. If you can switch to the agenda slide. We will start our session this morning with the review of our fourth quarter earnings by Fran, and then we're going to have a brief Q&A session just after that, where I'd really like you to stay focused on the earnings that we released in that piece of the agenda. We're going to be followed by our strategic and financial piece, and then we'll open it up to a broader Q&A, where we'll have Ivan join us, as well as Fran and Lowell, of course. So with that, I'd like to hand it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ivan Seidenberg. Ivan?\nIvan Seidenberg: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Once again, I would like to thank all of you who are here and those of you on the webcast for joining us this morning and participating in this earnings call. Just a very short introduction here before I ask Fran to join us. I thought, with all of the moving parts and all of the strong momentum that we have been developing here in the end of 2010 and a very exciting set of prospects for 2011 and beyond, that our investors needed a little grounding in making sure they understood our strategic, operational and financial metrics. And hopefully, this morning, while we're not intending to make a lot of new, big news, I think you will be pleased to see Fran and Lowell share with you what they think the vision is and the model looks like as we go out into 2011 and 2012. I also thought it was very important that you have a chance to see and touch and talk to both Lowell and Fran as we enter this important year, 2011. And for those of you here in person, of course, the opportunity to go in the back and play with our toys and all the new products and services is always a nice thing, and you\u2019ll get a chance to see how all of this new technology comes alive for the customer. So with that brief introduction, as John just mentioned, what we'd like to do is the structure. Our first order of business this morning is to cover 2010 earnings. And for that, let's ask Fran to come up and do that for us right now. Thank you.\nFrancis Shammo: Thank you, Ivan. Well, good morning, everyone. For those of you here in person, as well as those on our live webcast, I want to thank you for joining us today. During the transition period with John Killian, I had the pleasure of meeting a few of you. For many of you who I have not yet met, I would like to look forward to that later today or in the near future. Okay, so let's move into our first topic for today and review our fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial results. After my remarks, we'll take some questions, and then move onto the rest of the program. Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. The factors which may affect future results are contained in our SEC filings and are also available on our website.  So going to the next slide, for fourth quarter '10 overview. We ended 2010 on a high note, with very strong overall financial performance in the fourth quarter, driven by continued solid execution and growth across all of our businesses. The Wireless business is performing extremely well. Service revenue growth in the fourth quarter remains strong at 7.7% year-over-year, driven once again by Smart phone sales to both new and existing customers. We had a solid quarter of postpaid customer growth with 872,000 net adds, and we continue to see accelerating growth in postpaid ARPU, which was up 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. We improved our industry-leading customer retention metrics this quarter. In local number portability, we were net positive against all major carriers.  In terms of profitability, we reported a record high service EBITDA margin of 47.5%, which we are obviously quite pleased with. In Wireline, the financial picture continues to improve. We had positive quarterly revenue growth in consumer and enterprise, and the benefits, our workforce reduction and other cost initiatives are resulting in improved margin performance. The Wireline EBITDA margin expanded for the third consecutive quarter and was up 80 basis points sequentially, from an adjusted margin of 22.7% in the third quarter to 23.5% in the fourth quarter. This reflects the impacts of the pension accounting change between the Wireline segment and corporate. The sequential increase had nothing to do with the accounting change. It was driven by improved operational performance.  Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on opportunities to expand our Wireline margins. Our increased scale and the success of our FiOS products, including our recent launch of Flex View, are clearly helping both top line and margin performance in the consumer and small-business markets. Global enterprise revenue increased sequentially in the fourth quarter and showed positive growth of 1.3% year-over-year, driven by an acceleration of growth in the strategic services. In terms of cash generation, we had another outstanding quarter. For the full year, our improving operational performance, the tax benefit initiatives, the efficient capital management, resulted in an increase of free cash flow of $2.4 billion. Our focus on reducing leverage has improved our key metrics and strengthened the balance sheet.  Lastly, through a combination of share price appreciation and dividends, we generated a 23.1% return to shareholders in 2010. In addition, Verizon shareholders also received the equivalent of $1.84 per share in value through the spin-off of our Wireline properties to Frontier. So all in all, I say we are very pleased with our financial performance. Let's now move to our detailed review of the quarter. So on the financial summary, let's start with earnings. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings for the quarter of $0.93 per share. The non-operational items amounted to a net favorable impact of $0.39. Setting these items aside, our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.54.  As far as the non-operational impacts go, although the overall impact of accounting for pension and retiree benefits under the new methodology was a net cost of $600 million for the year. The fourth quarter impact was a net pretax gain of $2 billion or $0.44 per share. This was due to the previous recognition of pension and benefits losses resulting from pension settlements earlier in the year. The fourth quarter benefit was due primarily to favorable investment returns and an increase in the discount rate during the fourth quarter. The second non-operational item is merger integration cost related to Alltel. During the fourth quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.05 per share.  This concludes our two-year integration program, and we will no longer be identifying these as non-operational costs going forward. Consolidated revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 2.3% year-over-year, up from 2.1% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. For the full year, total revenues increased by $1.9 billion to $104.4 billion. Our fourth quarter operating income increased by 18.2% year-over-year compared with the third quarter growth of 11.3%.  For the full year, operating income grew $1.4 billion or 8.4%. The adjusted EBITDA margin grew 40 basis points sequentially to 33.6%, and was up 260 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2010, the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 32.9%. We're making good progress improving profitability. Our cash flow also remains very strong. More on that in a minute.  Now to adjusted EPS. First, I want to make a couple of additional points of clarification on earnings. The quarterly display on the chart before you show our earning results adjusted for the impact of divested operations, as well for the non-operational or one-time items which occurred during the year. The first thing I'd point out is that the first three quarters of 2010, as displayed on this slide, are different than what we showed you on the similar slide last quarter, and that is because of prior period adjustments due to the pension accounting change we announced last Friday.  Reported EPS changed, as did the amount of non-operational one-time items. The net effect was an incremental $0.01 charge to adjusted EPS. So whereas the first three quarters of adjusted EPS used to be $0.49, $0.52 and $0.56, they are now $0.48, $0.51 and $0.55, as shown on this slide. This reason for the painstaking detail here is because I want to tie back to our earnings guidance statements in July and October.  On our second quarter earnings call, we stated that our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of the year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.01 per share, which excluded the earnings of the divested operations. That first half base is now $0.99 because of the accounting change. On our third quarter earnings call in October, we stated that our expectation was at the high end of this guidance. With our $0.54 in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and our $0.55 third quarter result, you see that we delivered on this earnings target, ending the year with adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share. This is the proper 2010 earnings base you should use when forecasting 2011. The important point here is that we saw an acceleration of earnings in the second half of the year.  Let's spend now a few minutes on cash flow, dividends, capital spending and the debt on the next slide. For cash flow from operations for the year, on a full year basis, totaled $33.4 billion, up 6.3%, and free cash flow was $16.9 billion, an increase of 16.4%. In addition, we received $3.1 billion in cash from the Frontier transaction in July, and a cash distribution of about $400 million from Omnitel, which we expect to continue in the future.  As we highlighted on our last earnings call, our board approved a dividend increase last September for the fourth consecutive year, demonstrating their confidence in the strength of our cash flow, our balance sheet, as well as our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. As stated previously, Verizon shareholders also received $1.85 per share in value through the Frontier transaction last July. Again, a very good year from a standpoint of shareholder return at 23.1% for the year.  Looking at capital expenditures, we spent $16.5 billion in 2010, which was $400 million less than 2009 and below our targeted range of $16.9 billion and $17.2 billion. As you know, during the year, we effectively reallocated capital between Wireline and Wireless, shifting more toward our growth opportunities in order to maximize investment returns. In Wireless, our capital spending was higher than 2009, driven by 4G LTE deployment and increased 3G network capacity requirements, which included preparing for the launch of the iPhone.  Wireless CapEx totaled $8.4 billion, which was an increase of $1.3 billion over 2009. Conversely, Wireline capital spending was down, reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. Wireline CapEx for the year came in at $7.3 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion compared with 2009. In terms of the balance sheet, our top priority has been to reduce leverage. We're doing very well here with total debt of $52.8 billion, down $9.5 billion or 15.2% for the year. Our cash balance at December 31 was $6.7 billion, so we ended the year with net debt of $46.1 billion, a reduction of $14.1 billion or 23.4% since the end of 2009. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to about 1.3x from 1.9x at the end of 2009.  Let's now take a look at our revenue trends on the next slide. As I said earlier, our overall revenue performance is improving and we saw an acceleration of growth on a comparative basis in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Consolidated quarterly revenues of $26.4 billion were up $592 million or 2.3% from a year ago. Growth was driven by solid performance in all of our strategic areas, which roughly comprise 2/3 of our total revenue. We'll get into more details at the segment level, but the highlights are Wireless service revenue grew 7.7% on strong data results.  We had another strong quarter in FiOS with year-over-year growth of more than 26%, and we sustained growth in Enterprise Strategic Services of 7.5%. To be balanced, offsetting these growth areas were other parts of our business which are not growing. Services like international wholesale voice, core voice in our consumer and enterprise units and High Speed Internet outside the FiOS footprint. I would say, however, that these services, whether taken collectively or individually, are becoming a smaller portion of our overall revenue mix. During our decade-long strategic transformation, we have aligned our company with major growth trends driving our industry. You will hear much more on this from Lowell and myself later this morning. We are very optimistic about our future growth prospects.  With that high-level summary of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless. Our Wireless business turned in another extremely impressive quarter, particularly with respect to profitable revenue growth. Total revenue grew to $16.1 billion in the quarter, up $873 million or 5.7% year-over-year, with total service revenue up 7.7%. Our continued focus on expanding the market for mobile broadband drove data revenue to $5.3 billion this quarter and comprised 37.1% of total service revenues. During 2010, total data revenues increased to $19.6 billion. That's $4 billion of data revenue growth in one year. Think about that number, and then you can understand our excitement about the revenue opportunity with 4G LTE tablets, 4G LTE, all new 3G and 4G Smart phones that are coming to the market. We are confident that the Verizon network advantage will become even more of a differentiator in the marketplace in 2011 and beyond.  In terms of customer growth, we added a total of 955,000 net new customers. 872,000 of these were retail postpaid, which is roughly 50% more than we added in the third quarter. Retail postpaid gross adds in the quarter were up sequentially 5.2%. We ended the year with 94.1 million total customers, with 88% of the base being retail postpaid, 5% retail prepaid and 7% resell. In terms of other connections, we have a total of 8.1 million machine-to-machine connections, which include vehicle tracking and telematics.  Let's take a closer look at ARPU. As you know, we are focused on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to grow revenue by adding customers, increasing data usage and driving higher Smart phone penetration. Throughout the year, we saw accelerating postpaid ARPU growth from 0.6% year-over-year growth in the first quarter to 1.5% in the second to 2% in the third and now, 2.5% in the fourth quarter. Clearly, we are gaining momentum in this critical metric through increased Smart phone penetration. Retail postpaid data ARPU was obviously a big driver with year-over-year growth of 19.3% in the fourth quarter.  Revenue from Web and email services increased to more than $2.9 billion this quarter, up more than 43% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 35% of data revenue, is still showing good growth, up 9.6% on a year-over-year basis. And our strategy of stimulating data growth and Smart phone penetration is also improving customer retention. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent. Total churn for the quarter improved 1.34%. Our retail postpaid churn was 1.01%, improving by six basis points sequentially and four basis points year-over-year.  Now to Smart phones and devices. In terms of Smart phone penetration, we now have 26% of our retail postpaid base with these devices. That's up substantially from 15% one year ago, and there's plenty of headroom left. In the fourth quarter, more than 75% of our postpaid net adds were Smart phones, and 45% of our postpaid sales in the quarter, which include both upgrades and gross adds, were Smart phones. As far as upgrades, about 9% of our existing postpaid customer base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, a pretty strong result given our messaging around 4G LTE. Our Smart phones talk free promotion within family share plans was a big contributor to upgrades in the quarter. Interestingly, about 63% of Smart phone upgrades were new to this category, which is very good sign in terms of incremental data, revenue moving forward, even within our existing customer base. At the end of the year, we had 5.8 million data devices in our postpaid base with 323,000 added in the fourth quarter. Within this category, our Internet devices, like 3G and 4G PC cards, MiFi devices, tablets and notebooks.  So while we've made rapid progress in a relatively short period of time, adding 9.3 million Smart phone customers this year and substantially increasing data ARPU, we strongly believe both connections and data ARPU growth could really explode over the next several years with proliferation of 4G LTE devices and the iPhone opportunity. In just three weeks in December, we added 65,000 subscribers to our 4G network, of which 41% were new to Verizon. Wireless profitability.  In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 14.6% from a year ago. Our fourth quarter's EBITDA margin was at 47.5%, a very strong result. We have consistently demonstrated our ability to sustain and expands margins this year through a combination of revenue, growth, effective cost-saving initiatives and continuing to mine synergy savings from the Alltel acquisition. In addition to effectively managing our cash cost per sub in a business as usual manner, we also identified and captured about $1 billion in additional cost savings in 2010 through focused efforts in our supply chain, customer service and a number of other areas within our business. And while we're encouraged by these savings, I certainly see more opportunity throughout the organization to further enhance productivity and make the business even more cost-effective. As always, you can expect us to continue to achieve both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of Smart phones and other data devices, which we drive continued revenue data growth.  Let's move to our Wireline segment. As I said during the highlights, we are encouraged by the improving revenue trends. The 2.8% year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter marks an improvement from a 3.6% decline the last quarter, and we have excluded the effects -- if we exclude the effects of the international wholesale pricing change, total Wireline revenues were down 1.1% year-over-year, mainly due to declines in other wholesale operations. On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 26.8% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds our $146 per sub, is up more than 4% over the fourth quarter of last year. FiOS now accounts for 53% of our consumer revenue. On the enterprise side. We had our third sequential quarter of revenue improvement and growth in strategic services, which include security, IP, our managed solutions, continues to transform the revenue mix.  Let's now take a closer look at the consumer and business markets. Within the mass markets' category, consumer revenue of $3.4 billion in the quarter grew 1.6% versus last year. Here, we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to $88.85 this quarter, which is up 10.7% from a year ago. As I've said, FiOS now represents about 53% of consumer revenue, which is important because the increase in scale of FiOS and the strength of our broadband video products are driving positive revenue and ARPU growth, and are now large enough to more effectively mitigate the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business.  We had a solid quarter of growth in FiOS TV, adding 182,000 subscribers, which was a 22% improvement over fourth quarter last year. We ended the year with a total of 3.5 million FiOS TV customers, representing annual growth of better than 26%. Our FiOS TV penetration at year end stood at 28%. On the broadband side, we added 197,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the quarter, a 31% year-over-year improvement. Our FiOS Internet customer base increased 24% to 4.1 million in 2010, representing 32% penetration of homes opened for sale. By adding in our 4.3 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the year with a total of 8.4 million broadband connections.  Underlying our strong FiOS performance is the fact that our customer satisfaction ratings are very high and our churn rates are very low. Our renewed focus on sales and increased penetration is paying off. In our more mature FiOS markets, we are still seeing consistent penetration gains. Penetration at some of these markets is in excess of 35% and a few in excess of 40% penetration. In addition, as we stated at the end of the third quarter, multidwelling unit or MDU customers, have become a bigger portion of total net adds, particularly in the second half of the year. So again, we are pleased with our progress in FiOS, and we look ahead to a good year in 2011.  Let's move to business. While revenues in the business market continue to be challenged by macroeconomic pressures, we are seeing signs of improvement. Global enterprise revenue of $4 billion was up modestly on a sequential basis and also up 1.3% on a year-over-year basis, driven by increased CPE sales and improvements in key products within our strategic services category. Strategic services, which now represent 44% of global enterprise revenue, grew 7.5% year-over-year and 3.7% sequentially. Within this category, strategic nonworking, like private IP and Ethernet services, continue to show steady growth as do strategic solutions. Our security services grew 12% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, as we are seeing the benefits of being named the number one global leader security by Gartner Group.  Importantly, in the fourth quarter, the absolute dollar growth in strategic services outpaced the dollar decline in core enterprise services. We are encouraged by this, as the size of our strategic services is large enough to mitigate the secular and cyclical pressures elsewhere in the business. So again, we are seeing some early positive signs, but we still have cautious posture, as we look for additional signs of recovery in the broader economy. But overall, we are encouraged by improving trends in global enterprise. In global wholesale, revenues declined 12.1% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.  Domestically, voice revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures and lower usage volumes. Internationally, our route rationalization strategy, where we increased voice pricing in certain geographies, has resulted in a loss of business and a substantial decline in international voice revenue. In the fourth quarter, we experienced $179 million decline on a year-over-year basis. Absent these effects, fourth quarter global wholesale revenues declined 5.5% year-over-year. Since we introduced these price changes in the second quarter last year, I'd say we have two more quarters of somewhat tough comparisons to work through before the revenue impact of these actions moderate. I think it's also important to add that while this strategy has certainly resulted in revenue declines, it is having the desired effect on profitability, as our absolute margin on these routes have improved.  Let's cover Wireline profitability. In the fourth quarter, EBITDA increased by $82 million, resulting in an 80 basis points sequential improvement and our EBITDA margin of 23.5%. Again, our historical margins have had upward adjustments due to the pension accounting change, but they are all on a comparable basis. That said, during the year, we increased the Wireline margin by 240 basis points from our low point of 21.1% in the first quarter. On an absolute dollar basis, our fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA was higher year-on-year for the first time in recent memory. While a majority of this improvement this quarter was once again driven by cost savings, third-party Internet connection cost, margin improvements were also helped by revenue growth in FiOS and global enterprise.  Our workforce reduction initiatives in 2010 were successful in helping us lower our cost structure and reduce our overall cost labor. The Wireline headcount declined by about 16,000 year-over-year. As you know, a majority of these reductions related to voluntary separation offers accepted by our associate workforce. While it's unlikely that our workforce reductions in 2011 will come close to what we experienced last year, our focus on continued -- to reduce the Wireline cost structure will be just as vigilant. I can assure you that this is one of my primary focus areas across the entire business, not just in Wireline. There are many more areas to capture additional savings, and you'll be hearing more on our progress as we move through the year.  So to sum this up, we had another solid quarter and strong second half of the year, resulting in improved earnings and solid momentum. We had strong Wireless growth with record high profitability. We remain confident in our ability to grow the business by adding new customers and driving higher Smart phone penetration. And with our demonstrated ability to tightly manage our cost structure, we continue to grow profitably, sustaining a very strong service EBITDA margin. As you've seen and heard this morning, our Wireline performance has improved over the course of the second half of the year. Our cost-reduction programs have stabilized Wireline profitability, and we are optimistic about our opportunities to further expand margins going forward, particularly as we begin to see an acceleration of revenue from our growth areas like FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services. Our sharp focus on capital spending discipline, maximizing free cash flow and deleveraging has resulted in a stronger balance sheet.  Let me wrap up here, as we will be sharing more on our strategic and financial outlook with you later this morning's program. At this time, I'll open it up to the floor for questions.\nOperator: John Hodulik.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank: Quick question on the Wireless margins, the margins in the fourth quarter up sequentially. Could you give us a little bit of detail on the billion dollars in cost savings that you identified. Maybe, where they're coming from? If there are potentially more to go? And even more importantly, when those came out during the year? I mean, was it something that affected the latter half or even the fourth quarter more than the other quarters? And then maybe just a couple lines on some of the below the line items, which seem to be a little bit different than we'd expected this quarter.\nFrancis Shammo: So first, on the overall cost initiatives within Wireless. They set up the year on a $1 billion cost initiative, which crossed all types of things, like customer service, store operations, logistics, real estate. But the biggest one this year that had the most impact was logistics. In logistics alone, there was a $750 million cost reduction within the whole ecosystem of our logistics system. That came throughout the year, but obviously, the bigger part of that came in the second latter part of the year. So that really was the big portion. As I said, and I'm going to talk about later, they have yet another $1 billion challenge for 2011, and we could talk more about that in the later program. On the second issue, John, I think that as we look at what the consensus was, we were higher on EBITDA margin, we were higher on operating income margin. But then on the below the line item, I think the big disparity between consensus as us, is how minority interest is calculated. And of course a lot of that EBITDA margin was driven by the Wireless unit, so there was more minority interest, I think, than what was expected on the consensus side. So that's how we got down to the bottom.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Jason Armstrong from Goldman Sachs. First, just a follow up on John's -- the balance between strong adds and margins this quarter in Wireless, I think, really exceeded expectations. You guys put up a record Smart phone add quarter this year, but still had record margins, which really kind of frames, I think, the investor debate into next year because there's a sense out there that you can't maintain margins, EPS is going to drift because of the type of volumes you're going to see. So maybe just help us think through what actually happened in the fourth quarter. I'm sure there was obviously some cost-cutting initiatives that played into that, but just how that sort of sets the stage into next year. And then maybe on the volume metrics, the 870 in postpaid adds. It seems like there were actually probably some limitations at the customer level in 4Q, big network changes ahead, big handset refresh ahead, seems like that number actually could've been a lot higher. So what do you think maybe the run rate of the business is?\nFrancis Shammo: I think we're going to cover a lot more in the next session, but let me just set the stage. From a fourth quarter standpoint, even with the adds that we had in Wireless, with the cost reductions we had, we only had a 0.2% increase in our cash expense. So for all of the adds that we had, a significant majority of that dropped right to the bottom line. And I think that, as we've said before, and I'm going to have some fun in the later session because the question I always get is how long can you maintain these margins. And I'm going to have some fun with that in the next session. So hold that question. But I think as we go forward, I think you'd expect us to run the business like we always have. It's all about execution, and it's about execution on profitability and growth. And it's an and equation for us, it's not an or. So I think Lowell will speak a lot to the strategy. I'm going to talk a lot about the iPhone expectations, where we think it's going to be. So I think I'll come back to your questions in the second half.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Staying on the postpaid adds, you had a strong performance in the Internet devices. I think you said 323,000. Can you contrast that with where that was, say, your Q3 a year ago, what the delta is there and what the characteristics of those devices are in terms of ARPU? And then if you could just touch on what was going on in reseller and wholesale.\nFrancis Shammo: So on the Internet, we had our best quarter in the fourth quarter this year. And I think really, two things contributed to that increase. One is, as we said, within three weeks of launching 4G LTE, we sold 65,000 Boggles, 41% of them were new to Verizon. So that was a contributor to it. The second is, as we launched our tablets starting in October with the iPad, and then shortly thereafter with the Samsung, we sold about 86,000 tablets in all. 37,000 were just stand-alone iPads; the rest were all with iPad with a MiFi device and with the Galaxy. So 96% of them were new to the category. So these were folks who did not have any type of data usage on this type of a device before. So 96% of those customers were new to this category. So that helped boost the quarter from an add perspective. And then, I'm sorry, Simon, go to your second question again.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Resell or wholesale.\nFrancis Shammo: So on the reseller side, we grew by 152,000 net adds. And then on the prepaid side, we lost 70,000. And then I think the important thing here is obviously, as we've always said, we are a postpaid retail company. But we believe that those other segments are important. However, we're not going to chase those segments when we think that we can have more postpaid growth. And if you think about the Reseller segment and with the unlimited offerings that they used, they flip between carriers, depending upon who has the best price at that point in time. So I think you saw a little bit of that, but we still added 152,000 reseller net adds. On the prepaid side, as you saw, we launched new prepaid pricing at the end of the quarter, in December, adjusting our rate down to $1.99 from $3.99, but instituting a $0.02 text messaging fee. So we think that, that stimulated some more retail prepaid growth in the last month of the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the disconnects from October and November. So I think we see some little momentum going there, bringing our price down more to where the rest of the market was. On the wholesale side, I think it is important that we really distinguish this international coin, because if you think about it, on the 12.2% wholesale decrease, 28% of that was driven by the international wholesale piece. So when you state that out, the wholesale decline was only 5.5%. And we did that because, as we said before, there were a lot of routes that were not profitable or very slim margin routes, where we decided to raise our price. That traffic went away, the revenue declined, but I think as we work through that in the third quarter next year, I think you'll see a different picture for us going forward on wholesale.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc: Could you talk a little bit more about the improvement in the Wireline margin? How much of that is labor-related versus non-labor types of cost improvement?\nFrancis Shammo: Well, I mean, obviously, we had a 16,000 reduction in labor this year. So there was a more of a significant impact there, and of course, a big majority of that was driven by the associate population who decided to accept the incentive that we put on the table and work with our bargaining folks. And we put that on the table, and 16,000 associates took that. So obviously, that was some of the decline. But I think there's more behind the story than just that. I think you have to look at the whole picture, which is the increasing of FiOS. So FiOS is becoming a bigger portion of consumer. And when you think about Access Line loss, we went from 9.3% Access Line loss down to 8% in the final quarter. So you're seeing a declining trend for us in access loss. So the other thing is, as you look at the ARPU on FiOS, it's becoming a much bigger segment, it's 53% of the consumer revenue. When you look at Access Lines, it's now only 7% of our overall corporate revenue from a consumer standpoint. So it is becoming less and less significant. FiOS continues to make progress and profitability. So I think you have to look at the whole thing. But obviously, there is a lot of cost reduction initiatives that are there. I mean, you can take the labor piece, but I think you also have to look at everything that Virginia Ruesterholz\u2019s group does out of Verizon Services organization, which is real estate, energy, fleet management. It is just disciplined execution on all those costs that help contribute it to the margin increase.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Just following up a little bit on that, two questions, if I could, on the Wireline top line. First, just specifically with respect to FiOS, as it now creeps over 50% of the consumer revenue. As it grows, is it a lower margin product that, as it grows, you need to cut costs faster? Or as it grows, is it margin accretive to the business? Is this a good thing it\u2019s growing, or is it not a good thing it's growing from a margin standpoint? And then second, just quickly on the enterprise recovery, we saw 1.3% growth. Was there any help or lift from the consumer premises equipment hardware side of that equation?\nFrancis Shammo: So from a FiOS prospective. The interesting part here with FiOS is as FiOS grows, it's becoming more profitable. And it's because we are becoming more efficient in how we connect the home, how we passed the home, how many labor hours it takes to connect that home. So if you look at the whole picture, the more we do, the better we are, and the better and the more efficient we get at it. Now, as I said, our goal is always to add between 180,000 and 200,000 TV net adds in a quarter. I think we've increased the penetration, as I said before also, in the third quarter, is we've concentrated much more on the MDU space. So if you look at the MDU's, we actually opened up 500,000 MDU open for sale this year versus only 300,000 last year. That became a bigger portion of our adds in the second half of the year and MDU's holistically, are more cost effective to connect because once you build the building, it's now just connecting all the apartments or condos within that building. So I think you're seeing some more of the efficiency there, which then drives more ARPU up. I think also, there's a couple things with Flex View. So we just launched Flex View. In the short period of time we've had Flex View out there, we've only had 2,000 titles on that platform. That will grow to over 9,000 by the end of next year. Within those eight weeks that we had Flex View out, we sold 41,000 titles at approximately $15 per title. So now those titles are in the cloud, which now these consumers can watch on any device, anywhere, anytime and around the world. So I think that is also going to help us drive some more incremental ARPU with very little cost, when you think about adding those Flex View titles. So I think that goes to the FiOS story. Then on the second piece with enterprise, the 1.3% sequential growth. Two components really helped with that growth. One was consumer premises equipment. But I will tell you that we have, over the last four quarters, have sequentially increased our price in consumer prem equipment. And I can tell you that we have doubled the margin on the amount of equipment we sell now. And I can also tell you that we have really moved ourselves away from what we would call drop shipment. We're letting other people plan the drop shipment space. Really, where we're selling consumer premises equipment is bundled with our strategic services and our IP components. So then when you take a look at the second component, which is really strategic services, we had our best growth of the year at 7.5% increase in strategic services. That was really driven by our security portfolio, which had a 12% increase year-over-year. We are gaining momentum in the marketplace on security because of the great ratings that we've gotten from Gartner as the number one global provider of security. So I think really the strategic services is really where we're focused at, the equipment comes with all the other bundles we're selling, but the equipment margin is increasing year-over-year. Okay, I think what I'll do is I'll stop there because, I want to get to the next part of the program. So what I'll do now is I'm going to invite Lowell McAdam, our President and Chief Operating Officer, up to the stage, and he will take us through the next phase of the program, which is more of a strategic discussion.\nLowell McAdam: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for braving the elements and coming in today. I saw lots of you are interested in all the goodies we have in the back of the room there. I will report nobody stumped the jukebox, however. I know a few of you tried to come up with a song that we couldn't pull out of memory, but, sorry. So far, no winners. Okay. So what I'd like to do is spend a few minutes this morning telling you where we stand as we enter 2011 and why I believe we're positioned so well to provide greater shareholder returns in the next several years ahead. I'm new in this position, and I've spent the last few months of this role traveling around Verizon, immersing myself in the details of the business and getting to know the business in its overall entirety. The more I do that, the more it's clear to me that Verizon's assets, both globally and domestically, are really the best in the business. As you know, I've spent the last, we've spent the last several years investing in strategic technologies, like FiOS and LTE, as you saw in the back of the room. We've been acquiring critical assets, like MCI and Alltel, so that we can extend our reach in the global markets and add scale to really deliver more on the bottom line. We've also divested lower growth, what I would call nonstrategic assets, in the Frontier and the FairPoint transactions, so that we can improve our ability to compete and grow in the markets that we choose to serve. So this superior asset base gives us really a solid foothold in the growth markets of the future for broadband, for wireless data, for video and for cloud services. I think businesses that we're seeing now are gaining scale and momentum, as we saw in the second half of 2010 and you saw in Fran's presentation earlier this morning. So I feel very good about the competitive position as we look forward, and I'm confident that we are poised to leverage those assets in 2011 to deliver superior performance for our customers, but also to drive higher returns for our shareholders. And I'll underscore what Fran said a couple minutes ago. We are a growth and a profitability company, and we're going to continue that track record.  As you see on this slide, I'm not sure it's widely appreciated how thoroughly those investments and those portfolios have really transformed our revenue profile over the last couple of years and differentiated us significantly from our competitors, both in the marketplace and from a shareholder perspective. If you look at these charts, from 2006, we've grown the revenue base from around $88 billion to $104 billion. And if you look underneath those top line numbers, we've really transformed that revenue base. Wireless has grown to more than 60% of our revenues, up from about 43% in 2006.  Now the two big drivers, obviously, the Alltel acquisition, but also the rapid growth of Wireless data revenues, and you saw that on some of Fran's charts. Wireless data and Wireless will now make up 20% of our total revenue, and as you saw in fourth quarter, growing it better than a 25% clip year-over-year.  You also saw from Fran together strategic Enterprise services and FiOS account for about 13% of our revenues, up from only 6% in 2006. And you saw both of those segments grew strongly in the fourth quarter. So that means legacy and other services account for just over a quarter of our revenue base, whereas in 2006, they were more than half. So in a very real sense, we've rebuilt Verizon around the growth markets of the future, based on a foundation of superior network that gives us, really, a set of platforms for innovation that I think is unprecedented in the industry. You have 3G and 4G Wireless. You have the Fiber base of FiOS. You have Fiber in the backbone. You've got a huge network of cloud and data centers around the globe that really provide those platforms.  Now our networks give us a strong strategic position that put us at the center of the trends that I believe are going to be driving growth in our industry for the next years to come. With our broadband presence across the U.S. and around the world, we're positioned to grow as the global economy improves. And I think we're all seeing predictions that that's going to be happening in 2011. Customers expect to be connected now wherever they are, and that's an expectation that's driving demand for mobility and broadband connectivity in the home. Video\u2019s evolving into an anytime anywhere service, and it's fueling that demand for increased speed and bandwidth on both the Wireline and the fixed side of the business. And businesses are shifting to security and secure IP and secure managed services.  Now that shift to IP and digital content and computing power are moving to the cloud, both business and consumer, by the way, which opens up another growth area for companies like Verizon that have integrated assets across the broader ecosystem. Now one of the real challenges in this anytime, anywhere world is that content flowing across global networks, again, both fixed and mobile, is increasingly in the form of video, which taxes the networks like never before.  You see some of the growth areas in this chart. Five hours spent watching video every day, dramatic increases in mobile and online viewing, increased demand for integrated, multiscreen experiences and connected devices, and enormous demands of video over the Internet, more than 90% of Internet traffic by 2014, most of which is going to be streaming. So again, Verizon's investments in bandwidth and capacity, both at the edge and in the backbone, have prepared us to be a leading player in this multiscreen marketplace.  So it starts with our global capabilities and the Internet backbone facilities. Thanks to the MCI acquisition of a few years ago, Verizon's a major provider of services on a global scale, with 180,000 customers around the world. That's in a world that's increasingly depending on transporting terabytes of video and data around the world to a wide array of devices. Our high-capacity global networks position us to accommodate that rapidly increasing demand. We have the Internet Backbone in 159 countries on six different continents. We have high-speed, undersea cables linking all the world's major markets. We have the most connected Internet Backbone network, we've been rated that way in 11 of the last 12 years. We're the first company to deliver commercial, long-haul service at 100 gigabytes per second. And we have over 200 data centers around the world that we can deploy to service the cloud demands.  We've also beefed up our capabilities and professional and strategic services through acquisitions, such as the security firm Cybertrust, which we purchased a couple of years ago.  Just as important to those physical assets, we've got 3,000 professional consultants in our digital business, whose expertise gives us a leg up on growing the market for these managed and intelligent services. Strategic services now combine more than 44% of our $15 billion in global enterprise revenues, and we're positioned for even faster growth as we move forward.  So finally, we have a great opportunity to extend our global reach and scale through our partnership with Vodafone, and that's a little bit of a change in strategy for us. In the past, this has really been largely a financial relationship with Vodafone. But now we're putting together a strategy and a structure to operationalize this partnership by aligning our technical roadmaps, by gaining efficiencies through procurement and by putting together unified account teams to handle the multinational, large enterprise corporations.  Now I think with the talent and resources of the two companies, there is much more that we can do to deliver superior experiences for our global customers and expand into higher growth vertical markets to again deliver greater value for our shareholders.  So the global presence positions us to be a big player in the next generation of computing as well. And where everything we do, media, communications, personal data, network intelligence, security protocols and many more will be stored in the Cloud and then delivered anywhere in the globe. This shift to an everything as a service model expands the addressable market for Verizon's global services dramatically.  Now experience tells us, as you see on this chart, every time we see a paradigm shift in computing, we see the number of users go up by a factor of 10. And industry analysts, like Gartner and IDC, size the cloud market at about 120 billion over the next five years, with a growth rate in the range of 20% a year. So with those 200 data centers I mentioned, with global IP backbone, with the service portfolio we have, we are better positioned, I believe, than just about anybody to capitalize on this fast growing market by delivering any content to any device anywhere in the world with all of the network quality and the reliability that our customers have come to associate with our brand. So in short, our assets put Verizon right in the center of the trends driving growth in our industry.  Now let me shift gears here for a second to FiOS. I talked a moment ago about the growing dominance of video on the Internet. Well, the optimum platform for handling that kind of bandwidth demand is Fiber, which is why we made the investment in FiOS when we started building back in 2004. Now we're approaching the end of our FiOS build. Over this last six years, we've completed reaching 15 million households. And when we complete our FiOS build of 18 million households, we'll cover about 70% of our territory.  This fast FiOS network can handle high volumes of streaming video and on-demand content, including 3D sports, games and entertainment. And recently, as some of you may know, we upped the ante by increasing our throughput speeds to 150 megabits per second, and that really sets a new benchmark in America for high-speed Internet access. In essence, we've used that FiOS investment to totally reinvent the consumer Wireline business around the growth markets of the future. It is a question we had a couple of minutes ago, now over 50% of our revenue, right?  So now, our focus and my focus is on driving that investment to deliver greater returns. Fran talked overall about the improving financials of the FiOS business, and I think it can generate a lot higher margins as we go forward and certainly, improve the composite margins and ARPUs that we see in the legacy products of the Wireline business. Customers have responded very strongly to the FiOS product, and we think 32% Internet penetration and 20% TV penetration gives us a lot of opportunity for upside growth.  Now we're also really excited about the opportunity FiOS brings to further transform the broadband experience and deliver a whole suite of broadband services for the home, and you saw a few of those in the back of the room earlier this morning. We see that fiber-connected home becoming the hub for managing all aspects of the customers' digital life. Now what's bringing this long predicted vision to life is the increasing number of connected devices in the home, combined with that high-speed connections and a flood of web-based content that needs to be managed. And when you layer on the social trends, like energy conservation, telework, environmental concerns, we see tremendous opportunity for companies that deliver a truly efficient, integrated, connected home solution.  Now with this platform for the future largely in place at this point, we can now focus on using it as that launchpad for the entry into new markets that will leverage that FiOS investment and expand and diversify the revenue stream of the Wireline business. And Fran touched briefly on that in the question-and-answer session. We've also spent, though, many years building the premier nationwide wireless platform for the anytime anywhere era. We've deliberately assembled our national footprint through a series of strategic transactions that you see on this chart that transformed us from regional players by combining GTE, Rural Cellular, PrimeCo, Vodafone, AirTouch, Alltel into the nationwide player that you see here over the last 15 years. And we've integrated all these separate companies into a seamless whole, establishing the country's leading Wireless brand.  Also in 2004, we ushered in the area of mobile data by launching our 3G Wireless network, which made us the largest, most reliable Wireless voice and data network in the U.S. Now since that time, we've doubled our 3G capacity every year, consistently investing in cell sites, spectrum and backhaul, and increasing our throughput speeds. We've bulked up our 3G capacity again in advance of our iPhone launch. Now I hope you all had a chance to look at the iPhone in the back of the room. I can tell you, I've been using this personally, and this is a terrifically performing device, and we expect great things of it as we add it to the network. So the 3G network has been and will continue to be a platform for innovation and technology driven growth.  Now we've accommodated the doubling of usage on our 3G network every year with no degradation of quality. We're the largest provider of Android products in the country, which in 2010 was the fastest-growing platform of any phones in the market. And we have the highest quality, most loyal customer base in the industry. And again, this was all before we added the great Apple products to our portfolio that you'll be seeing a lot more of in 2011. So again, we think 3G will continue to be a growth engine, not for just '11, but for several years to come. So now let's shift gears a bit.  At the same time, we've been actively preparing for the next generation of mobile broadband growth. In fact, I'd say we've been preparing for this over the last decade, as you see on this chart. Those of you more familiar with our industry know that spectrum really is the life blood of the Wireless business, and we've consistently added to our spectrum depth and breadth to ensure we have the capacity to meet this large consumer demand that we're seeing.  The key transaction was probably in 2007, when we purchased the nationwide spectrum in the 700MHz range, which paved our way for the investment in a superior 4G LTE network. As you see on this chart, we launched LTE in December in 38 major markets, home to 1/3 of all Americans. We'll double that in the next 18 months to some $200 million POPs and we'll blanket the country by the end of 2013. I believe LTE is a real game changer, and I don't use that term loosely, because it increased speeds on our network by a factor of 10 and cuts latency in half, which is the piece that many people miss. That makes it suitable for two-way video traffic, real-time applications, cloud computing and all the other mobile broadband experiences that are going to dominate in this anytime, anywhere world that we talked about. And riding that 700MHz spectrum, it has significantly better in building penetration than other so-called 4G technologies. And it dramatically enhances the value proposition that we can bring to customers.  Now customers are already beginning to see the benefits of LTE. Those of you have been around a while, remember the old they won't come, there\u2019s not going to be any devices, well I think at CES, we announced a suite of consumer-oriented Smart phone tablets and devices for 4G from several manufacturers. We're also working actively with developers and entrepreneurs from across the high-tech industry to expand the market by further developing a robust LTE ecosystem. Our partnership with Google around the Android platform is just one example. And if you happen to be at CES and you went by our booth, we showcased more than 40 devices from 60 different developers, and that was the range from game players to cars to smart energy to meters to healthcare devices. And through the open development initiative, we're working with more than 6,000 developers to help integrate their applications and software onto LTE. Collaboration is how growth and innovation will happen in the Wireless market in the future. And we believe our commitment to network innovation, our spectrum position and all of our other blended assets make us the preferred partner for such efforts.  All of this, I think, will speed up the innovation cycle, and it will position us for growth from a number of areas. First, a diversified portfolio of devices. We're seeing all major manufacturers and platforms are represented. We're going to see increased Smart phone penetration.26% today, I think we'll be at 50% by the end of 2011, or even higher. I think we're going to see increased ARPU from mobile data and video. We're going to see new revenue streams from innovations now just beginning to come to the market, like machine-to-machine. So I think we're ready for this coming mobile broadband era, and we're excited about the opportunity to kick start another growth cycle in an already vibrant sector of our business.  Now the real magic happens when you put all of this together. You've got LTE, you've got Fiber in the network, you've got Fiber in the Backbone, you've got global IP networks, you've got all the different devices and apps and interactive content being developed to deliver experiences more powerful than anything we've seen to date. And with video and data comprising the bulk of the traffic on mobile and broadband networks, we have a tremendous opportunity to optimize the flow of content across LTE and FiOS to deliver those integrated services to customers wherever they are.  Now our Flex View product, again, I hope you saw it in the back of the room, is an early glimpse at this content anywhere world, what that will look like. And as you see on this chart, our foundation of what I call high IQ networks and that massive Cloud infrastructure gives us growth opportunities across every one of our businesses. There aren't many providers who can take the customer from their home to work and everywhere in between, wherever they are in the world, and we're one of that select group. And we really believe those high IQ networks are the hub of the wheel that will drive the industry forward. So the assets I've just described give Verizon that unmatched strategic position in the growth markets of the future.  Now my focus is on leveraging those superior assets to deliver superior value to our customers and to our investors. In my mind, these aren't separate goals, but they rather exist in a dynamic relationship, that virtuous cycle of investment, execution, growth, profitability in which success in one area feeds and is therefore fed by all of the others. Well, that's why I've challenged the leadership team around Verizon to execute around this model to deliver growth and profitability. So first, consistent investment starts with having the right tools in the toolbox. So we'll continue to allocate capital to growth platforms, systems, technologies and product sets.  Second, we have to have strong portfolio management. As we've done in the past, we'll continue to actively manage our portfolio to add strategic capabilities through selective M&A, where we can and where necessary, and we'll exit nonstrategic businesses as well.  Third, operating excellence. We need to deliver on the power of our assets through fundamental execution, operating at maximum efficiency and providing customer interactions that live up to the promise of our superior networks.  Fourth, we're going to defend and extend our market position. We have aggressive business plans for competing in the marketplace, growing revenue and taking market share. And as we do that, we'll generate profits, and that cash will allow us to keep investing and turning that wheel of this virtuous cycle.  Now in my time at Verizon Wireless, we had a strong history of execution around profitable growth. And I come into this new position with the same expectation. Anyone who's worked with me for any length of time has heard my philosophy that no matter how good you're doing, how successful you are in others' eyes, there's always opportunity to do better. We call it our higher gear philosophy. And I'm absolutely convinced when it comes to delivering that value for our customers and shareholders, we can raise our game even further in the next several years. Our team is focused on instilling the culture and the incentives across the business to drive performance and execute that game plan that I've laid out for you today. We are very confident that superior execution will lead to superior returns for our shareholders.  Now I know you want to understand how does that translate into the numbers. So I'm going to bring Fran back up at this point to talk about our targets for 2011 and beyond. Thank you.\nFrancis Shammo: Thanks, Lowell. Okay, so now we'll move to the, just the guidance that I think everybody showed up to hear today. So first, let me just talk about, you heard Lowell talk all about the strategic nature of where we're headed. Let me just tell you where my focus is going to be. Obviously, driving profitable top line growth. As Lowell said, we're going to continue to invest and allocate capital to those growth areas that we have in our platforms, enhance the return on invested capital. I've seen a lot of articles written about the telcos and the invested capital. This is a real concentration for me to make sure that we start to return on what we invest in from a growth platform prospective.  Obviously, generating free cash flow, maintaining our dividend policy and returning to our shareholders. Let's go to the next slide. So if we look at revenue, so from an overall perspective, there's a few things that are flowing into the revenue projection. One, service revenue, 7.7% growth this year. Obviously, we believe that there's more growth there for next year. Data revenue, 26% penetration. If you paid attention to Lowell's charts, we believe there will be 50% plus by the end of 2012, with all of the devices that we're bringing to the market, both 3G and 4G. Smart phone penetration, as I said, and then, of course LTE, just in a matter of three weeks again, 65,000 adds, which were 44% new to Verizon.  On a consumer side, we have FiOS growing 10.7% in ARPU year-over-year on a consumer basis, $146 per sub, grew 4% this year. With the launch of Flex View, as I said, 2,000 titles, we sold 45,000 of them in just a matter of six weeks. So there's more potential from the Flex View as we continue to add titles and also, as we continue to add TV programs that will be able to be bought through Flex View.  Then on Enterprise, overall strategic services grew 7.5%. We see that continuing to escalate as the macroeconomics, if it stays where it is today, if we get any bump in the economy, that will, of course, drive GDP, which will then enhance the Enterprise services side. And then of course, you heard Lowell talk about Cloud. And you're going to see us move into the Cloud space in a very big way in 2011. And we'll talk more about as the quarters go on, but you can expect us to do more growth in the Cloud arena. So when you take all of that, to combined with the launch of the iPhone, 4% to 8% growth for next year on top line revenue.  Let's go to the next one, please. This is the fun chart I have. So the fun chart is don't ask me anymore how long am I going to sustain 47% margin. This is a chart that shows, as Lowell said, it's all about execution and profitability on the Wireless side. And I think we have proven that through the history of where we are. So from that perspective, let's just move on to the next topic.  From an overall perspective, I think it's all about how do we prepare for the iPhone launch. So on the iPhone launch, when we talk about execution, refer back to the last slide. We are not going to have any flaws on the execution of the iPhone launch. The next is, if we go to customer service, we've hired over 3,000 people currently, who have been trained. And if you think about it, we launched the iPad, so that our customer service reps in our stores and in our centers could get used to the interface of the iPhone, which was a pre-launch to the iPhone. So we've trained everyone, extensive training around that. Then when we go into just overall, if you could put those four slides back up on the iPhone, please.  So if we go to the overall network. We've been preparing the network for expansion for the last year, anticipating the launch of the iPhone. So we are well-prepared from a network prospective. And then from a policy change, there are a number of policy changes that are taking effect. So one is, we have discontinued the new every two for new customers. Now that doesn't mean that our current base is not qualified to exercise their new every two right. They are. But for new customers, there will no longer be any more new every two. So if you think about that, you can do the math, but before you would get a $50 to $100 credit going forward on any upgrade, that disappears. The customer will be getting the promotional price at that point in time for a new phone when they qualify.  Second, we are changing our return policy from 30 days to 14 days, and even at 14 days, it's still one of the best in the industry. And then most recently, you'll hear more about this in the coming days, but we are launching a trade-in program. We have entered into an agreement with a third-party, where we will be taking trade-ins from anyone who wants to bring us a trade-in phone. They will be getting a credit from the third-party participant, and then we will welcome them into any device that they choose on the Verizon Wireless network.  So if you go to the next slide, please. So from a Wireline overall efficiency, I think we've shown that with our FiOS growth, 53% of the revenue is consumer and strategic services, 44% is global, part of the global enterprise space. Overall, consumer access, as I said, is less than 7% of the overall revenue, and we believe there will be Cloud acceleration in 2011. In addition, we will continue to drive the cost reductions within Wireline. We will continue to drive the synergies through VSO on real estate, energy, access costs. So with all that said, I think that we are comfortable saying, as I've said in the past, we continue to see margin expansion in our Wireline unit.  If we go to the next slide, please. So from a capital perspective, Wireline capital, as we've said, we have reallocated capital very efficiently this year. So if you look at the Wireline segment, our capital expenditures went down by $1.7 billion. That was reallocated back into Wireless. So Wireless increased by $2 billion, which was really the preface of building capacity on EVDO for anticipation of the iPhone usage and building out our LTE network.  So from a guidance standpoint on capital for 2011, you could expect it to be flat or slightly down from 2010 performance. But again, I think it's critical that there will be a major reallocation again in 2011 between where that capital is invested, as both Lowell and I said, it will be invested in the growth platforms of the business. If we go to the next slide, please. So from an EPS earnings per share relevancy. But first, before I get there, I think there's a few things that we need to talk about.  So there's a lot of things that go into projecting an earnings per share for a company. It's not just about an iconic device of the iPhone and what the impact of that's going to be. So if you think about everything that we've talked about here today, the revenue growth in all the segments that Lowell and I have talked about; if you talk about the cost reductions across the board, both in Wireless, Wireline and corporate; if you think about the capital efficiency, the cash management efficiency we have, the pension and op-ed planning that we've done, and just to remind everyone, on Friday, I said that all the changes that we made, the pension and op-ed expense, will be zero to slightly positive for 2011.  Now going to the iPhone. If you think about this, there are a lot of things going in to projecting what the iPhone volume could be. So one, it's all about supply. Two, it's the mix of sales versus upgrades. Three, it's about what is our projection going to be. So I'm probably going to disappoint everyone, but I'm not going to give you an exact forecast that Verizon has for the iPhone because there's too many variables that go into this. So what I've done is I've taken the consensus average, which is 11 million phones, we've put that into the model, and given everything else that Verizon's going to do in 2011 based on 11 million units of the iPhone, you will get a 5% to 8% EPS accretion in 2011.  Now sensitivity around that is if I do more than 11 million units, then obviously, I'll be on the low side. If I do many more than 11 million units, I may actually fall outside of this range. But I think the important thing here is whatever this 5% to 8% will be based on the units, and obviously, we'll inform that as we go through the year, it just means that much more upside for 2012. So when you think about this, 2x is not out of the range for a number for 2012 based on these projections of 11 million units. So you'll be hearing more about that as we go from quarter-to-quarter, but that is more or less the consensus that we have today.  If you go to the next, please. From a shareholder return perspective, obviously, the concentration that Lowell and I have is to continue to return to our shareholders what they expect from us, which is growth in the share price and maintain our dividend policy.  Next slide, please. So overall, I think you've heard from Lowell and I, I'm not going to repeat everything on this slide, it's just a regeneration of what we just talked about. But I think you can tell that Lowell and I are both focused on delivering what we need to deliver. So at this point, I'm going to go ask Ivan and Lowell to rejoin me back up here on stage, and I'm going to open it up to the floor for Q&A.\nIvan Seidenberg: Nancy?\nUnidentified Analyst: The 2x you just mentioned in 2012, what did that refer to? You said 2x wouldn't be unreasonable in 2012?\nIvan Seidenberg: Based on a 4% to 8% projection, 2x that rate.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then second of all, if you could talk about the sort of ARPU subscribers\u2019 growth rate and the top line in Wireless in 2011 and then versus Wireline in 2011, how you break up the business on the top line versus that guidance?\nIvan Seidenberg: Well, I'm not going to give guidance on specific top line growth for there. So we'll stay at the 4% to 8% on total revenue guidance for the corporation.\nIvan Seidenberg: Just one clarification, the 2x is really related to, when you were talking to the earnings slide, correct?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, 2x on the earnings slide.\nIvan Seidenberg: So the EPS 2011 number, we are talking two times of what we had on that slide. Not the revenue numbers, for specifics.\nUnidentified Analyst: Earnings growth in 2012 looked more like 8% to 16% off of the 2011 base, something like that. Just on the Wireline side, you talked about all the drivers and the wholesale being a bare one. Is it possible that you think you could get to Wireline growth, obviously not for the year, but maybe by the end of the year or potentially in 2012?\nFrancis Shammo: Yes, so John, I think, as I said, the biggest driveway now is the wholesale side. So on the consumer side, you have growth from FiOS. On the enterprise side, you have growth. So it's really the wholesale side. And I think that as we get through the third quarter on the international traffic situation, I think you'll see some improvement there. Mike Milligan, who's the President of our wholesale, believes that there are, through the Fiber to the Cell program that we have, through Ethernet that we have, they actually grew 6.6% year-over-year within that segment. So as we continue to see some of the decline in the voice side, I do feel that there could be a potential. If the economy stays steady and we get some growth in the economy and wholesale comes back, we could be back to a growth in the overall segment.\nLowell McAdam: And John, I think I had to add to that -- I think there's some good, let's say, let's call it earnings potential on the core side as well. I see lots of opportunities to take more cost out just by being more efficient, not just on the labor side, but more efficient on how we provision, how we maintain, so we have fewer dispatches on that side. And as you and I were talking earlier, we've seen a slight decrease in the disconnect side on the core. And if we can keep the quality and the expense in a good position there, I think we can improve overall profitability of the core.\nJohn Doherty: [Operator Instructions] I'm going to go over to Jonathan Chaplin with Nancy.\nUnidentified Analyst: So a quick question for Fran. I think you mentioned you expected 50% Smart phone penetration by the end of 2011. That's a doubling from where it is at the moment. And I expect it goes higher than that in 2012. It should drive a very significant increase in postpaid ARPU. With that in mind and how accretive to margins that increase in ARPU is, why aren't you expecting more in terms of earnings growth between now and 2012?\nFrancis Shammo: Well, I mean, again, I think you have to look at the holistic picture. But obviously, it's because of the iPhone and the subsidy on the iPhone.\nUnidentified Analyst: So, I would expect that to be a big pressure in 2011. And so maybe you don't see that EPS growth in 2011. But as you go through to 2012, it's with all the iPhone subscribers that you add in 2011 and the impact that has on ARPU, I would've expected a bigger jump than 10% to 16% in earnings.\nFrancis Shammo: Well, at this point, what I said was under the assumption of the 11 million units, you could factor in at 2x. But at the end of the day, I'm not giving guidance on '12 because I don't know yet what the total volume will be in '11.\nLowell McAdam: We've got a couple of, I think, significant moving pieces here. Obviously, the iPhone is one of them. But if you take a look at the 4G devices that we've got outside, I mean, they are terrific devices. And the tablets that go along with those, we're working very hard with lots of different developers to bring new applications. I mean, there's a lot of upside. And I can tell you, later this afternoon, Ivan and I will meet with the employees, and we'll be talking a lot more than 50%. But I think we've got to be very careful that we guide you in a prudent and conservative way, and that's kind of where we are at this point.\nJohn Doherty: Why don't we go over to Simon?\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: I think you mentioned, Lowell, about depending on iPhone supply. Can you just give us some clarity around that? Is this a situation where you're going to have some significant backorders in the February, March period? And then the obligatory Verizon Wireless Vodafone dividend question, what's the latest on that? What's the timing we should think about there?\nLowell McAdam: Those two questions are interesting bedfellows, I have to say. So on the supply side, you all see the different forecast. And we've spent a lot of time with Steve and Tim, talking about what we might expect, not only existing iPhone subscribers, but there's a lot of people on other networks that are interested in that device on the Verizon network. So from that part, you could be wildly optimistic or you could be conservative. Now you also have to factor in, you remember last year, we ended up with a shortage of screens and some of the basic components because as we started to come out of a little bit of a downturn. So our hesitancy to give you a strong number on supply is just we don't know whether we'll be able -- the demand is very variable and some of the components are variable. But we feel very good on hitting the kind of numbers that Fran talked to you about. Now on Vodafone, I think I need to reemphasize that trying to change this from a pure financial partnership to an operating partnership. If you look back over the last 11 years, our technologies were so far apart, it made it difficult to sort of reach across the aisle and do a lot of things together. Well, they've launched LTE in Germany. Obviously, we've launched LTE. We see now, especially when you look at all the things I talked about on the asset side, that them working with us from not only just Wireless, but from the business side, really is a competitive advantage for both of us. Now we've said over the years that eventually, we'll be into a place where we'll be giving a dividend. To me, they contributed the assets. We knew this day was coming. It'll be a fair dividend. We'll get their support for making additional investments in the business. That's the key for us, is to keep Verizon Wireless very healthy. And if there's excess cash on that, then we'll dividend it out and Fran will use some for our investments across the business and Victoria will use some. But I think that as we get to the end of this year, we'll sit down and we'll talk about it in the board, and we'll figure out what a fair and reasonable dividend is.\nJohn Doherty: Why don't we go over to Jason?\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just one follow-up. I guess one of the key inputs is around iPhones, of where they're coming from. And if the consensus is 11 million units, can you help us think through in percentage terms, is it more weighted towards external? Is it internal Smart phone upgrades, which I guess you're doubling Smart phone percentage, which suggests it's not. Or is it existing feature phone upgrades? Maybe help us think through that.\nFrancis Shammo: I think a couple of important facts here, Jason. One is if you look at our current base today, 52% of that base is on feature phones with no data plan. There's another 15% on multi-video type devices, which only had a $10 data plan at that time, which you know now, we have discontinued that line. So within our own base, there are 67% of the people who can upgrade and bring more ARPU with them. So if you think about a feature phone customer going to a Smart phone, the ARPU on that is 2x what they deliver on a feature phone. So I think it's important because I don't know exactly what the mix will be at this point in time. But I think it is important to know there is tremendous growth within our own base by moving that base to Smart phones, whether it be an iPhone or a DROID or some other device. So I think as you think through that, I think you have to look at the overall base, plus what would be coming in from new.\nJohn Doherty: I'm going to go to Jim Peshek. Question from the back.\nJames Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital: Jim Ratcliffe, Barclays Capital. Two questions. Quickly, Fran, did I hear you say that you won't be offering the $15 data plan for iPhone customers?\nFrancis Shammo: The $15 promotional price that was offered will be discontinued at the end of this month.\nJames Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital: You've chosen to take legal action to push back against the FCC's net neutrality proposals. How do you see those affecting the business, whether those proposals actually take effect or not, and particularly regarding applications like Flex View?\nIvan Seidenberg: I don't think it'll affect it at all. I think the FCC decision, kind of a far-reaching one. I think that most of the impact of that order won't be felt this year. But over the longer term, it would be felt if the FCC actually exercised all the authority. Just for a point, if you actually read the rules they put into effect, the rules don't sound anywhere near as troublesome as the order, which is encourages the FCC to seek broader authority over time. So I don't think it'll have any effect on the current business, but I do believe that longer term, we need to challenge the expansion of the FCC's authority there. Since I have the floor, let me just add a point to the last couple of questions on this guidance question. Fran and Lowell tried to give you as much guidance as we can. There's a couple of unknowns here. But I think it's worth just slowing it down a little bit. So we can get into this contest of, so we think we know how many people will switch from T to us. We don't really know the answer to that. We know you're being subjected to lots of discussion around that. We do believe that our brand and our network will drive a lot of people. But so Jonathan, to your point about what will earnings look like in the future, why don't you do this. Over the next couple of quarters, as we get some experience on volumes, we'll share with you what those results look like, and I think you'll get a better view. It's much better than overestimating something that we don't know. The other point is that we also believe that all our strategies will frankly lift the whole industry. So, yes, this is about us today. But I think that as all these 4G and 3G devices get out there, you will find all of the carriers doing better. Our view is we'll do better because of the position we've established, but the entire base is going to move from feature phones up to Smart phones over the course of the next 12 months. So I think you're sitting in a really good spot when we look at the entire industry growth. And obviously, we believe we'll have an edge on that. So I think when you look at these numbers, my advice is be careful about '11, and '12 and '13 will absolutely be clear to you once you get to the middle of the year.\nJohn Doherty: Chris?\nChristopher Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies: Chris Larsen from Piper Jaffray. Fran, can you talk a little bit about the optimal capital structure and within that, not just at the corporate level, but also the Wireless level. Going back to the dividend question, arguably the Wireless business will be under-levered if it was a stand-alone business. Do you think about it as a stand-alone business when you think about that capital structure? And then do you think maybe it makes sense to lever that up and then cash that out to the parents? And then what is the proper leverage ratio for Verizon? And then a second question, as you look at the last 30% of your access lines that aren't going to have FiOS, what's the long-term strategy for those access lines?\nFrancis Shammo: So I'll take the capital and maybe I'll have Lowell take the long-term strategy on the access lines for the LTE. But on the capital structure, I think the way we look at it, is as we've said, we're going to continue to de-lever. So that de-lever will happen in the Wireless unit. I am not going to lever up just to distribute cash to the parents. That's not going to happen. But I'm also not going to build cash in Wireless either. As Lowell spoke about, when the time comes, we'll start to deliver cash to the share owners. So I think that's how you have to look at this. But overall, we will continue to manage our capital structure. We will continue to manage our debt levels and refinancing and position, taking advantage of some of that better interest rates in the marketplace. And we will continue to do all that. But I think, as we said, our target for EBITDA to debt ratio, we are at 1.3 today, and we will continue to de-lever that.\nLowell McAdam: So on the core in the 30% that's less. Let me tell you, my priorities, first, are to get better penetration on FiOS. Every customer I talk to, investors, you name it, if they've had FiOS, they've used FiOS, they go holy cats. I didn't think there was a difference. There is a difference, and they love it. So I've got to go back to what we did with Verizon Wireless in the beginning, when all the carriers were viewed the same and we came up with the can you hear me now campaign, and people really appreciated reliability. We're going to find that message so that we can get penetration up. When you get penetration up, the profitability changes, so that equation may change as well. Now we're also going to, as I said earlier, work on the basic profitability of that 30% to try to make that better. If we can sustain it, and I think we have a tendency and I think all of you have the tendency to sort of write things off very early on. If we get to the point where we do those two things and it doesn't make sense for us, then we'll look at additional dispositions. It depends on where the properties are and that sort of thing. So I'm not ruling out anything. But my number one priority is to make FiOS more profitable and stabilize the other core assets.\nJohn Doherty: Let's go over to Kevin Smithen?\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie Research: Fran, do you think this revenue growth is sustainable for a few years? And you gave a lot of different metrics on the Wireless data front. Could you maybe talk about what the penetration right now is of your subscriber base that have a data plan and maybe what the average ARPU of that data plan is? And related to that, somewhat, I know it's complex, but do you think Wireless broadband can start to cannibalize Wireline broadband, given the speeds and maybe the capacity upgrades you see in the next couple of years?\nFrancis Shammo: So from a guidance perspective, I'm not going to get into that detail of the guidance between what the ARPU growth will be. And I mean, what we say is we're at 26% penetration on data today, we'll be at 50% plus. Data revenue is 2x that of a feature customer. So that's where we're at. As far as cannibalization from LTE, I think what you have to look at is I don't think that the broadband connection to the home with the speeds that are being enabled at 150 megabits per second through FiOS, that's going to go away. I think that given the amount of content that will be put into that home, I don't think that will be a displacement for broadband connection. However, I do believe that when you get out into the rural areas, there's going to be some opportunities. And I'll pass it to Lowell, he can talk about the DIRECTV relationship and what we've done there.\nLowell McAdam: Well, we've got a couple of things. We've licensed our 700MHz in some of the very rural markets that we weren't going to get to for a while to the rural carriers, so that they could get that infrastructure up and operating. And as Fran mentioned, we've got a number of trials with DIRECTV where we have bundled, we've got a special antenna that we've developed together, but we've bundled the video service together with a high-speed Internet access service. And that, again, works very well in the rural markets. So there's ways to get in there. My view is over time, if I look over my years, the Wireless will sort of nibble away at the low end of the Wireline offering. But it's very difficult to beat a dedicated facility into somebody's house. And certainly, it's not on any roadmap I've seen where we're going to hit a 150 megabytes in a broad Wireless deployment.\nJohn Doherty: [Operator Instructions] Let's go with Michael, and then we'll go over to David.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc: A couple of questions. First in the Wireline side, management earlier last year, pointed out, I think, a $1.5 billion plus goal for cost cutting through the end of 2011. Can you give us an update in terms of where you are along that road map? And then secondly, Ivan, earlier this past month, talked about changes in management compensation that Fran made. And I was wondering if you could detail a little bit more, maybe about how some of the high-level goals or strategies for incentive compensation were changed?\nFrancis Shammo: So addressing the cost savings program. We, with the $1.5 billion, I don't remember that figure, quite honestly. But from running the operating unit during the year, we obviously achieved a significant reduction of employees. We closed over 7 million square feet of real estate, we either sold it or closed it or subleased it. We have significantly reduced the cost, as I said before, from a FiOS perspective. We have gotten more efficient as we have gone on. So I think at the end of the day, we achieved what we said we would achieve, which was we were going to expand the Wireline margin, which we did. And I think going into next year, as Lowell has said, that is going to be the consistent strategy going forward. From just an overall compensation standpoint, as Ivan had mentioned, we moved more risk to cash flow away from revenue. And obviously, you can see from the charts, the revenue growth is not going to be really quite an issue, but we have to make sure that we generate the cash flow at the bottom, both in the Wireline unit and the Wireless unit.\nJohn Doherty: David?\nDavid Barden: Lowell or Fran, could you talk about this, again, this 26% to 50-plus percent Smart phone evolution. In the base today, if 25% are Smart phones, those guys are generating $80, which means that the other 75% are generating $40. And so your game plan is to take a big portion of those people who pay $40 today and turn them into $80s over the course of the year, that's a lot of money for the next 25% to 50% of the base in terms of their income and getting them up the curve. So could you kind of talk a little bit about how you really make that happen because it seems like a very aspirational goal. And I guess my second question, if I could, Ivan, you announced that Lowell would be your successor last year. Could you talk a little bit about how you see your succession plan evolving this year in 2011?\nFrancis Shammo: So you consider, you think the 50% is conservative? I just want to make sure -- I mean, I get what you said about the future phone, I'll get to that. But your belief is the 50% is conservative?\nDavid Barden: Well, no, the question is to get from 26% penetration of people paying you $80 to 50% penetration of people paying you something much more than the $40 they're paying you now, you've really got to create either a much lower cost of entry or bridge them somehow from an economic standpoint because it seems like the first 30% of America is paying $100 or $80 for a Smart phone, no problem. The next 25% of Americans are going to have a bigger problem coming up with that wallet and how do you get them there.\nLowell McAdam: We can talk about this for a while here. That is, I would say, is right if you looked at the entire base of Wireless customers in the U.S. But remember, over the last 10 years, we have gone for that high-end customer and their families. And what we see, when we bring out a great phone like the DROID, and I expect it's going to happen exactly that way with the iPhone, is we pull a lot of family share lines with them. Now in the past, those were $9 lines. In the future, they're going to have the $39 or whatever our data package is associated with those. And what we see is once people get those phones in their hand, they say, \"I can live with a flip phone.\" We tease Ivan, he still carries a flip phone once in a while. But when they get those Smart phones in their hands, the usage goes up, they get on the unlimited plans or they move up in tiers. So I actually feel good about, and when Fran shared some of his charts, having those feature phone customers moving up with the set of devices we have and the clientele we have, I don't see that as a big problem.\nIvan Seidenberg: So let me just add to that. So part of your question is you assume the available discretionary income for Wireless is fixed. That's what your question was. We assume that even if you're half right, there are other things that will drive people to use Wireless products, medical services, going green. The business revenues will significantly increase as you go to data because people will have more work at home. We have customers, we have large companies coming to us. We have one large one who've said to us, \"We want every employee to work out of home.\" And so I think there's an opportunity to take this data platform and extend it to parallel industries and so the revenue pie we're looking into is much bigger than the one that you think exist today. So not only will those $40 customers become higher data users, but the $80 customers will go to $105 and $110. The other thing we've missed in this discussion is, I've been saying this, that my guess is that at least half this audience today is carrying two devices on them. Two years ago, you guys would say that can never happen, and half of you now have two devices. Our view is when you get to machine-to-machine and all these other things, they're going to find people carrying three and four devices. So I don't subscribe to the theory that the pie remains static. So I think that answers part of your question. Now the succession plan is based on what I just said being true, which is, that if we are really looking at this expansion of the pie and we take these two great guys, when you think about succession, you call up Madison Avenue, you got to get one guy with white hair and one guy that's angry all the time. So that's what we have. We have one guy that's white hair and one guy that\u2019s angry all the time. And so our board is in a place where they've asked me to work with Fran and Lowell through this year. Sometime, I've said this before, sometime in the second half of the year, Lowell will become CEO, and I'll spend a few more months after that as probably chair or whatever the board wants. And by the end of the year, we'll have the transition completed. Most of you know, transitions have a lot of components to them. Running your company, meeting your outside stakeholders, partners, politics, boards, investors. So we're working through all of that. Today is part of that drill. Hopefully, you saw a plan today from two people that have a very expansive view of the future and a really sound, solid record of execution. So I think for me, this is an easy transition. But there's still a few things that need to be done between now and the end of the year, and we'll get them done.\nJohn Doherty: Why don't we go to Kevin with Kevin?\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie Research: Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Equally impressive to your 872,000 net adds this quarter was the 9% retail postpaid upgrades to Smart phones and the 63% new to category, I think, bodes well for your 50% Smart phone targets. The question is with all of the hoopla surrounding the iPhone launch, you obviously had very, very strong momentum on Android and BlackBerry in Q4. How do you keep that momentum with the iPhone launch and continue to drive success in all of your Smart phones in 2011?\nFrancis Shammo: Well, I think you saw that in the back of the room, the 4G device lineups we have from major manufacturers are terrific devices. So the iPhone sort of establishes its own gravitational pull. But if you look at the CES show and how much attention we got around LTE, and you look at the breadth of those devices, I really feel good. And we frankly worked very hard to get here as that we would have a balanced approach. One thing we said we would never allow ourselves to do is to become a one phone company. And we're a portfolio company, and I think we've positioned ourselves that way. And what the message I was trying to send earlier today is that portfolio is also broad when you look at the Enterprise side, the FiOS side and the Wireless side. So we won't be one business focused and we certainly won't be one device focused.\nJohn Doherty: Let's go one more. Last one.\nUnidentified Analyst: No one has talked about this, so maybe it is a good one. Enterprise. To what extent is Enterprise outlook for 2011, 2012 really just about the economy recovering? And to what extent, you talk about Cloud, it seems to be on the top of everyone's mind, but I don't quite get the contribution that Cloud's going to make any time soon. Is there a J-curve investment? So could one of you address the issue with respect to the outlook for Enterprise, talk about Cloud, the economy, and as lastly, is Vodafone synergies built into any numbers that you've put out there for 2011, 2012?\nLowell McAdam: Fran can take the synergy side. I mean, we do see lots of opportunity with Vodafone around procurement and hitting these accounts, but Fran can talk about the numbers. So Enterprise. No, I think it's much more than just the economy. Certainly, the economy will help, but as you see the different applications, and Cloud is a very interesting thing. Everybody's talking about it. But what we find, what I find interesting is you sit down with a customer and you start to have a security discussion. The Cybertrust is usually where we start the discussion. They've got things that they want to get out on the mobile network. They're very concerned about the security of it. We bring the Peter Tippett and the team in, and we do the discussion and then it turns into, well, now you can store that application for me on your Cloud and deliver it around the world. So I think that the economy certainly will help, but I think some of those applications will get us up that curve very quickly, I think, quicker than we think.\nFrancis Shammo: Then the answer to the question on synergies, no, there is nothing baked into the plan.\nJohn Doherty: And with that, we're going to bring it to a close with Ivan, making a few closing remarks.\nIvan Seidenberg: So thank you very much. I thought I would make just two or three closing points that will address some of your questions and put a bridge between what we've tried to do this morning and where you guys are. One of the things we wanted to do this morning was to establish a good foundation for our performance in 2010 and let you understand that we feel good about the fact that the beginning of the year, we didn't think the year would turn out as strong as it did at the end of the year, and there were some reasons why you've heard that and you could see clearly the difference that Lowell and Fran are making on the focus on execution in the company to make that happen.  What we wanted to do with the iPhone in 2011 is pretty simple. So to put this in perspective for those of you who are into conspiracies and into looking for other meaning to life, so you would think that this is my last year, so I would want to make sure that the year went smoothly. I also wanted to make sure my colleagues didn't overpromise and get in the doghouse for the next two or three years. So I've purposely made sure that whatever they told you this morning represented a fairly conservative but doable plan. So the issue for the iPhone is we don't have all the answers. We personally believe we'll probably do better than most people think, but we didn't want to set any standard because we don't know the number of people who'll move for it, we're not sure what the inventory flows will be, we're not really sure of how all that will time out, but we are sure, by the time we get to the end of the year, 2012 will look a lot stronger than 2011.  So we've told you everything we know, and that's kind of where we are at this point. We also wanted to make sure that when you think about the whole company, you don't just focus on the iPhone, but you look at the breadth of the assets that we have and the opportunities that we have to build the company.  Probably the most important issue I'll close on is for 2011. There\u2019s a lot of stuff written about earnings for 2011 will slide backwards because of the iPhone as opposed to going forward. Hopefully, you got this morning a sense from management that we're not accepting the idea that because we get a new iconic device in the system, that's an excuse for us to reduce our focus on growing the base in 2011. So we're going to work really hard to do that. Part of that, Fran drove this, he changed compensation for people to say don't ride on the fact we know we're going to have higher revenues because of the growth of FiOS and the growth of Smart phones. So he made sure our management understands that driving more EBITDA growth this year is a really important issue. So I think the company is positioned in a good place.  I also would make the comment again, just so you get a sense of this, I also think the entire industry is going to do better. I'm not trying to help the other, my colleagues in their assessment, but what I want to make sure is that you understand we believe the investments we've made, some of the investments they're making, will grow the pie. We happen to think we\u2019ll index better than they will, but the fact is, the overall pie for the susceptible growth. I want to thank Fran and Lowell, of course, and John for what they've done. Thank you all for bearing with us. I know two hours is a long time for a conference. But those of you who are here, thank you. Those you on the website, thank you. And we'll be back at you at the end of the first quarter. Thank you.\nJohn Doherty: You're welcome to stick around. And please join me in thanking Ivan, Lowell, Fran, as well as the whole team, that helped us pull it off."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-10-22 11:58:17", "content": "Executives: John Doherty - SVP, IR John Killian - CFO Fran Shammo - EVP and President, Verizon Telecom and Business\nAnalysts: Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs John Hodulik - UBS Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research David Barden - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon\nJohn Doherty: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer; and Fran Shammo, who will be assuming the CFO role on November 1. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. As I'm sure you are aware, we published reclassified historical financial information for the past six quarters for the results associated with the Frontier transaction, as well as the divested wireless trust properties. In addition, we reclassified prior period wireless results for the deferred revenue adjustment that we recognized in the second quarter of 2010. The financial and operating metrics included in our slides are therefore presented on a comparable basis. However, on the balance sheets and segments of cash flows, prior periods were not reclassified for the impact of the divested properties. On a GAAP basis, we reported earning of $0.31 per share in the third quarter. These quarterly results include a total of $0.25 of non-operational charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item is a non-cash charge of $0.19 per share relating to the recognition of pension settlement losses resulting from our workforce reduction and separation plans. Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded, once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. In connection with the closing of the Frontier spin-off, we also incurred a charge of $0.04 per share for certain non-operational and transaction related costs. The last item is merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the third quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Killian.\nJohn Killian: Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some comments on our overall performance and add some of my perspective to our third quarter results. The business is performing extremely well. We had another solid quarter, and we continue to execute well on our key focus areas. We had strong earnings performance in the quarter, showing sequential improvement. On our last conference call, I stated that our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of the year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.10 per share. Our third quarter results indicate that we are on track to meet this goal, and expect to be at the high end of this guidance. Wireless had a very good quarter, with accelerating revenue growth driven by strong postpaid ARPU accretion. New customer additions and device upgrades once again resulted in higher smartphone sales and drove data revenue increases. And we sustained our wireless EBITDA margin of 47.2%, which remains by far the highest in the industry. In Wireline, we continue to make steady progress. We had a very strong quarter of customer growth in FiOS with our third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, adding more than 200,000 new customers in both TV and Internet, our highest net add totals since the second quarter of 2009. Revenues in global enterprise were stable, showing modest sequential improvement. And while the wireline revenue picture is essentially unchanged, we were able to improve our EBITDA margin on sequential basis, coming in more than 20 basis points higher than last quarter at 21%. We'll talk more about this in a few minutes, but we feel confident that our workforce and other cost reduction efforts have stabilized wireline profitability, and we should continue to see these benefits in the fourth quarter. In terms of cash generation, we had another outstanding quarter. Our improved business performance and tight controls on capital have resulted in significant increases in free cash flow for the first nine months of the year. And our focus on reducing leverage has improved our key credit metrics and strength in the balance sheet. I'd also highlight that our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% dividend increase in September, which on an annual basis is an increase from $1.90 to $1.95 a share. This marks the fourth consecutive year of dividend increases. So all in all, we're pleased with our continued strong performance. Let's now move to a more detailed review of the quarter, starting with some financial highlights on Slide 4. Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.31 per share. The non-operational charges amounted to $0.25. So you can see that gets us to a $0.56 quarterly result. So we're building solid earnings momentum. I would point out that we saw about a $0.01 EPS benefit in the third quarter due to a lower effective tax rate post the Frontier spin-off. For the full year 2010, absent any further significant tax law changes, you should expect that the adjusted effective tax rate attributable to Verizon will be in the 31% to 32% range. Consolidated topline growth accelerated to 2.1% year-over-year and drove an 8.3% increase in operating income. Our adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 130 basis points to 33.4%. And cash flow continues to be very strong. One addition point on earnings, we are seeing sequential improvement. Slide 5 shows our quarterly earnings on a comparable basis. So our $0.56 per share this quarter is a 7.7% improvement over the second quarter. Let's spend a few more minutes on cash flow, dividends, capital spending and debt on Slide 6. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled $8.3 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of $25.2 billion is up 9.1%. And free cash flow of $13.4 billion is up $2.7 billion or 25.3%. In addition, we received $3.1 billion in cash from the Frontier transaction in early July that we used to reduce debt and a cash distribution of about $440 million from Omnitel this quarter. As I highlighted earlier, our Board approved a dividend increase for the fourth consecutive year, demonstrating their confidence in the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet and our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In addition, our shareholders received $1.85 per share and value through the Frontier transaction in July. I can assure you that we have adequate dividend coverage based on our cash flow and our capital spending outlook. We have no material funding requirement for our qualified pension plans in 2010. And as is customary, we fund our other post retirement benefit plans on a pay-as-you-go basis out of operating cash flows. Looking at capital, we spend $4.2 billion during the third quarter which was 4.5% less than a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, total CapEx was $11.8 billion, 4.9% below the first nine months of last year. During the year, we've effectively reallocated capital between our operating segments, reflecting growth opportunities. In wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE deployment and network capacity requirements. Wireless CapEx totaled $6.2 billion year-to-date which is an increase of $1.1 billion or about 21%. In Wireline, capital spending is down reflecting lower files deployment capital as planned. And our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. Wireline CapEx was $5.1 billion year-to-date, a decrease of $1.5 billion or 23%. Looking ahead, we expect our total capital spending for the year will be at the low end or slightly below our targeted range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion for 2010. In terms of the balance sheet, our top priority has been to reduce leverage. We're doing very well here with net debt of $47.8 billion at the end of the third quarter down $12.5 billion or 20.7% since the beginning of the year. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has improved to about 1.4 times, and we expect to be even lower by the end of the year. Let's take a look at our revenue trends which are on Slide 7. Our overall revenue performance is improving, and we saw an acceleration of growth in the third quarter on a comparable basis. Consolidated quarterly revenue of $26.5 billion were up $550 million or 2.1% from a year ago. Growth was driven by solid performance in all our strategic areas which comprised roughly two-thirds of our total revenue. We'll get into more detail at the segment level, but we saw an uptick in wireless service revenue growth driven of course by strong data performance. We had a very good quarter in FiOS with year-over-year revenue growth of more than 29%. And growth in strategic enterprises services is accelerating, up nearly 7%. With that high level summary of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Our Wireless business turned in another very good quarter particularly respect to revenue growth. Total revenue grew to $16.3 billion on the quarter, up $919 million or 6% year-over-year. And growth in total service revenue accelerated to 7.7% in the third quarter, our highest year-over-year growth rate since the second quarter of 2009. Our continued focus on expanding the market for mobile broadband drove data revenue to $5.1 billion this quarter, up 26.3% over last year; that's more than $1 billion of growth in just one year. We continue to make excellent progress in terms of increasing our smartphone penetration. With 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices, we feel very good about our current portfolio smartphones and we've build great momentum in a short period of time with Droid franchise. Our recent announcement to begin selling Apple iPads at retail locations is designed to stimulate sales of our MiFi devices which have already become quite popular with customers. We're performing well in this very competitive marketplace, but as confident we are about our ability to compete today, we are even more excited about the future. Earlier this month at a CTIA event in San Francisco, Lowell McAdam announced our Phase I 4G LTE launch locations. Our plan is to cover more than 110 million POPs and 38 major metropolitan areas and 62 airports by the end of this year. In the next phase we'll expand coverage to about 200 million POPs over the next 18 months. By the end of 2013, we'll have virtually the same nationwide coverage we have today on 3G. With wireless data revenue exceeding $5 billion this quarter, it's hard to believe that we're still in the early earnings in terms of this revenue growth opportunity. But we are very excited about mobile broadband, and we believe the growing interest in smartphones, tablets and other devices signals a new wave of growth for the industry. With the commercial launch of LTE just around the corner, we are extremely well positioned in this expanding market. We firmly believe that our network advantage will become even more of a differentiator for Verizon, given the consistent and substantial investment in our wireless network over many years. Let's now turn to our customer and connection results on Slide 9. We had a solid quarter of growth, adding about 1 million net new customers and about 250,000 other connections. In the retail postpaid market, we had 584,000 net adds and a strong quarter in terms of device sales. Retail postpaid gross adds in the quarter were up 9.8% sequentially, and device upgrades were also higher. Our performance in the reseller channel was also very good with 550,000 net adds this quarter. As we've said before, the reseller market continues to be a low-cost channel for us, and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended the quarter with 93.2 million total customers, with 88% of the base being retail postpaid, 5% retail prepaid and 7% reseller. In terms of other connections, we had a total of 7.9 million machine-to-machine connections, which include vehicle tracking and telematics. Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 10. As you know, our key focus is on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth by increasing data usage and driving higher smartphone penetration. Retail service revenues in the quarter grew 5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 2% compared with a year ago, sharply higher than the year-over-year accretion we saw in each of the first two quarters of this year. As I mentioned a moment ago, we had another strong quarter of overall device sales with about 9.5% of our existing postpaid customers upgrading to a newer device, our highest level since the fourth quarter last year. Our churn metrics, although a bit higher than the second quarter due to seasonality, were excellent once again this quarter. Retail postpaid trend was 1.07% and total churn was 1.36%. In terms of smartphone sales, we now have 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices. That's up substantially from last year, and there's plenty of headroom left. About 43% of device sales from our direct channels this quarter were smartphones, taking into account both gross adds and upgrades. And 60% of our existing postpaid customers buying smartphones were new to the category. So this is significant in terms of incremental data revenue for us. Revenue from web and e-mail services increased to more than 2.7 billion this quarter, up above 43% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 36% of data revenue is still showing good growth, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. And we've made rapid progress in a relatively short period of time, adding 8.4 million smartphone customers, and increasing data ARPU by 17.6% in the past 12 months. We believe penetration and data ARPU growth could really explode over the next several years, particularly in light of the growth opportunities in front of us with LTE. In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 11.4% from a year ago. Our third quarter service EBITDA margin was 47.2%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergies. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices which will drive continued data revenue growth. Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 13. On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 29.2% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $146 is up more than 6% over the third quarter last year. On the enterprise side, we had our second consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement in growth and strategic services, which includes security, IP and other managed solutions, continues to transform the revenue mix. In global wholesale, revenues continue to be impacted by the effect of some international price changes on specific groups, which were introduced last quarter to better manage margins. Let's take a closer look at the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 14. This time last year, FiOS made up about 40% of consumer revenue. At the end of the third quarter, it was up to 50%. The increasing scale of FiOS and the strength of the broadband and video product is driving positive revenue in ARPU growth and mitigating the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 1.1% versus last year. We continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to $86.55 this quarter, up 10.9% from a year ago. As I said earlier, we had strong sequential customer growth, adding about 19% more FiOS customers this quarter to our TV services, and about 17% more to our internet product compared to last quarter. We ended the third quarter with a total of 3.3 million FiOS TV customers, adding 204,000 compared with the 172,000 in the second quarter. On the broadband side, we added 226,000 new FiOS internet customers, compared with the 193,000 last quarter bringing our total to 3.9 million. Adding in high speed internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.3 million broadband connections. Underlying the strong performance is the fact that our FiOS customer satisfaction is very high, and our churn rates are very low. So we're pleased with the progress we are making with FiOS, financially, operationally and competitively. The good news about our success in penetration increases this quarter is that the improvements are evident throughout our entire FiOS footprint. Our focus has shifted from a geographic expansion mode to a focus on sales mode. Our goal is to increase FiOS penetration in markets where the service is already available and close the gap between homes passed and homes open for sale. The launch of our nationwide, no contract required, Worry Free Guarantee has helped sales, particularly in the MDU market where apartment dwellers in large urban cities tend to be more (transient) and may be more hesitant to sign two year contracts. And we focused our marketing message to emphasize our product differentiation. This focus on sales and increasing penetration is paying off, and in our more mature FiOS markets we are still seeing consistent penetration gains. Penetration in some of these markets is in excess of 35%, and a few are in excess of 40% penetration. As you would expect, in our less mature markets we have significantly more room to grow. So we're optimistic about our ability to further increase penetration and continue our growth path over the next several years. Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 16, which shows our Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macroeconomic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global enterprise revenue of $3.9 billion was up modestly on a sequential basis, and down 0.8% year-over-year, primarily due to foreign currency effects. And while the quarter once again included strong CPE sales, we also saw improvements in revenue from network and solutions-based services. Strategic services, which now represent about 43% of global enterprise revenue, grew 6.9% year-over-year and 3.1% sequentially. Strategic networking, like Private IP and Ethernet services continue to show steady growth, as do strategic solutions. So again, we are seeing some signs of stabilization, but we are still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any significant change. In Global Wholesale, revenues declined 10.2% year-over-year and 1.3% sequentially. Domestically, voice revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures and lower usage volumes. Internationally, we made a decision earlier this year to increase voice pricing in certain routes which has resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market. While the strategy has resulted in revenue declines, is having as a side effect as absolute margins on those routes have improved sequentially. Let's cover wireline profitability next. In the third quarter, EBITDA increased by $31 million resulting in a more that 20 basis point sequential improvement in our EBITDA margin to 21%. With total revenue remaining essentially flat sequentially, almost all of the improvement this quarter was once again driven by cost reductions, primarily wage-related savings and third party interconnection cost. Our workforce reduction initiative is proceeding as planned. Wireline headcount was down 5,900 this quarter and has declined by about 10,500 over the past two quarters. As you know, a majority of these reductions relate to our voluntary separational effort in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. With about another 1000 volunteers in other regions, we expect another 2000 to 3000 employees will leave our payroll by the end of the year. In terms of workforce reductions in the third quarter, we estimate the savings to be about $80 million. Partially offsetting these cost savings this quarter were acquisition costs related to higher FiOS customer volumes and some typical seasonal increases, including higher energy cost. Lastly, in terms of our other cost reduction initiatives, we are focused on capturing additional savings in real estate, network convergence, supply chain and inventory management. We have a well organized and realistic plan, and we are confident in our execution strategy. To sum up, we had another very solid quarter across the entire business, resulting in improved earnings and solid momentum. To reiterate, we are on track to achieve our goal of growing earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted days of $1.10 per share. Our wireless results were solid across the board. We remain confident in our ability to grow the business by adding new customers, and driving higher smartphone adoption leading to higher postpaid ARPU and improved revenue growth. And with our demonstrated ability to manage our cost, we continue to grow profitably, sustaining a very strong service EBITDA margin even with higher volumes and more upgrades than last quarter. In our wireline business, even though we're not getting any help from the economy, and we don't expect to for the rest of this year, our cost reduction programs have stabilized wireline profitability, and we are optimistic about our opportunities to expand margins going forward. As always, we will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. We are excited about our opportunities relating to a launch of 4G LTE services in wireless, and we are certainly very confident in the long term potential of the business. With that, I'll turn it back to John so that we can get to your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Couple of questions maybe first on wireless ARPU. The fourth quarter we've seen an accelerating postpaid ARPU growth. I'm just thinking, through these increases in smartphone penetration, which seem to really give you a good runway for further improvements in the rate of ARPU growth from here, I am just wondering if that's how you would think about it as well. And then, second question on FiOS. Good uptick in both FiOS, video and data adds. When thinking about the increase, can you just help us think through, is this attached to seasonal, is it the no contract moves that you've made and ultimately I thing what we're trying to get to is, is this kind of a new level that we should use as a run rate going forward?\nJohn Killian: I will take the first part of the question on ARPU, and then Fran will cover the FiOS performance. We are very pleased with what's happening with ARPU. When you look at our postpaid ARPU this quarter, we were up 2% from the third quarter. If you look back the last four quarters, fourth quarter '09 we were flat. We went to DOCSIS in the first quarter, we went to 1.5. And you all have seen that I have had on these clauses, we believe there is a lot of upside ahead of us and we have great ability to grow postpaid ARPU because of the explosion in smartphones. We've put a lot of energy, Lowell McAdam, John Stratton, Dan Mead, their team, on enhancing our smartphone portfolio. We've had great success over the last year with the DROID franchise and the Blackberry lineup and others, but we're in a much better position. But the good news here is only 23 % of our customers today have a smart phone. That's up from 20 last quarter. So you think about this I don't know where it's going to end up, but personally I think we're going to look some day back and say 70% to 80% of your customers are going to have a smart phone. So we think there is tremendous opportunity here. And you know better than I do, Jason, smart phone customers spend about double what a feature phone customer spends with you. We also believe on the feature phone side, more and more customers will buy some data plans over time even before as they are getting used to data on the wireless side. That'll start with a plan on a feature phone. So we think there is tremendous opportunity here to grow topline in the wireless business. And you can see that coming through and accelerating revenue growth in the wireless business. Fran, I'll turn to you on FiOS.\nFran Shammo: So to talk about the FiOS ads and the broadband ads, we are very pleased with the strong performance that we had this quarter. If you look at some of the questions you asked, Jason, on the no contract, as John has spoken in the past, in the MDU space, we were underpenetrated there. We have made a lot of moves, including the no contract. But we also made a move on the contract where we offer Worry Free Guarantee similar to the wireless side of the house. But if you're not totally satisfied, we will let you out of the contract with no early termination fee. We also have launched a triple play in the MDU space, understanding that a lot of this space is the younger adult segment, which if you look at the triple play that we have launched is broadband, it's TV and it's wireless rather than a wireline connection. So we found that that's also stimulating some growth in the MDU segment. When you expand that, the no contract definitely has had a very good growth prospective for us, but we have also launched something new in our enterprise space where we are going to our enterprise customers and very similar to what we do on the wireless side with employee liable accounts, we are signing up enterprise customers to promote our FiOS product within their employee base. So that has also stimulated some growth for us. So to wrap this up, yes, we feel that this level of ads is where we want to continue to be.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: First, on the wireless data pricing strategy, are you guys recently making changes or are there some in the press? And I guess I was surprised that you left the unlimited data plan out there. Is that a part of your strategy to increase the penetration of smart phones, and is that pricing essentially subject to change once you move to 4G and you potentially see data volumes grow? And then secondly on the wireline margins, it seems like you may have arrested the decline and you're starting to see some improvement. It sounds like fourth quarter, you see some sequential improvement. Is that something that we can see improve from here as we head out? Is there enough cost cutting opportunity for us to see improvements into 2011?\nJohn Killian: Again, I will take the first part of this question and then Fran will talk about the wireline margin. So I think what you're referring to John is some of the blog reports and some of the newspapers stories. We have not formally announced any change in data pricing, but we will be rolling out a data promotion next week focused on the fourth quarter. As we think about data pricing here and just to give you a little things to think about as we position this for the future, our aim here is really at expanding the market opportunity. We think there is a huge opportunity to continue to grow. We have a $20 billion annual wireless data business, $5 billion a quarter. It's hard to describe that as early innings, but we still believe it's the early innings of the data explosion. We're very focused at looking at opportunities to expand this opportunity, bring more of our base into data plans. The other thing to think about here is we believe we have built over time because of what we have done both with network investment, our advertising programs, is superior brand position that allows us to be unique in how we approach the marketplace from a data pricing, unique from what other companies do because of the brand position that we have built over time. Our fourth quarter promotion that we will have will have really two key elements we will continue to have in unlimited plan, the $29 plan, the $30 plan effectively that is unlimited. But we'll also have a $15 plan. And with the $15 plan, you will be able to get 150 megabits of usage. But what we believe is that people who are new to category will probably buy the $15 plan. But over time, you will see much more migration to the higher end, because there will be a lot of usage that will drive above the 150 megabit. So we think we are in a very good position. John, we are encouraged by tiered pricing. We like the concept of tiered pricing. You could interpret this a little bit as a move in that direction, although we had $9.99 plan before, but we will continue to look at this and we probably will have some pricing changes when we roll out 4G and 4G pricing. So there will be more to comment. Fran will now talk about the wireline margin.\nFran Shammo: So on the wireline margin, John, as John has spoken in the past, we do believe we've stabilized, we do believe that we can continue to expand the margin in wireline business. I would say that this is a two-pronged strategy. One is obviously topline growth. And I think that it's important to know that we've reached an inflection point this quarter where FiOS is now 50% of our customer revenue. So as we continue to improve the consumer ARPU 10% this quarter year-over-year, that will drive bottomline growth. I think it's also important to state that on the enterprises side we're seeing stabilization; however, outside the United States, in our global markets, we are seeing double-digit especially in the Asia-Pac region and some other area parts of the world. So again, that is more topline. But as we get into the cost and productivity and sustainability, as John has spoken in the past, we have an incentive offer for our associates. We had 12,000 associates accept that offer. About 80% of them have left the payroll to date. We will do more of that in the fourth quarter. But it's also important to know that as we attack the cost side of the wireline business, it's more than just the headcount reductions. It's quarter-to-quarter improvement in our operating metrics, especially when you look at FiOS and our cost-to-connect prim and our cost-to-connect video. If you look at our COA, our COA alone year-over-year has gone down 19%. And with that reduction, we've increased our ad. So it's a whole program of cost reduction. I believe it's sustainable. And while we are doing that, we're improving our productivity, so that when the economy in the enterprise restores and we continue on the track that we're in FiOS, we will continue to produce more margin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: John, it was a pleasure working with you. Wish you all the best for your retirement. You touched on the LTE introduction. Could you help us understand what other impacts there might be in terms of expense recognition or interest capitalization and the things around that? And as you roll out the LTE from $110 million into the sort of $200 million plus, are we at a steady state level here on Wireless CapEx where you're out of a run rate? Or could there be a reduction or a lower intensity in '11 as the heavylifting for the first 38 markets has already been done?\nJohn Killian: So, Simon, I think we're very pleased with where we are in terms of the LTE deployment. We mentioned getting to 110 pops by the end of this year. I talked to Tony Malone as recently as yesterday to get an update on status and all systems are go. The network will be in extremely good shape. From a normal customer acquisition in maintenance and those kinds of things, I think you're going to see the same kind of run rates looking ahead as you have seen, as we've gone through this year. I don't think you're going to see a major delta at all. In fact, we would argue overtime that there will be more efficiency driven by LTE because the cost of the megabit served is much lower with LTE than it is with EVDO and other technologies. So we think that will position us well. There will be some impact, we have been capitalizing some interest, it's not a huge number. But we will see some impact as we go into 2011, may be a little bit in the fourth quarter, but not a major delta there. From a CapEx perspective, what I would think about here is, on this call we've said we're going to come in at the low end of our range or slightly below. I think we have a good chance of being slightly below our guidance range on CapEx. You should think Wireless at probably at about the same level next year as it's running this year in that kind of a range. When you look this year, all of the increase we've had has really been for the most part, both on LTE as well as capacity for data. There had been other offsets; things like synergy capital will be going down. So I think it will be a very controllable level of Wireless CapEx. The nice thing here is the CapEx to revenue ratio in the Wireless business runs quite a bit lower than the Wireline business. And there is a lot of efficiency from that capital. So I think our cash flow numbers should continue to be strong.\nOperator: You next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.\nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: Just to follow up on that, more specifically on the Wireline side, how should we think about capital going into next year as the pace of new FiOS home is passed, continues to slow? And then coming back on the Wireless side, I noticed the replacement rate was around 9.5%, and then smartphones become a larger part of your base, and then hence a larger percent of the replacement volumes. How should we be thinking about the incremental cost related to that? And are there areas that you can identify to may be offset some of that upward pressure from just a greater pace of smartphone replacements overtime?\nJohn Killian: So a couple of thoughts for you here, Mike, and we're not in a position yet to give any guidance on CapEx for next year. But as I think about this, and certainly Fran will be talking about this in January. I think the direction of overall CapEx spending, and we've said this in the past, is down from where we are today. I'm not going to quantify that exactly, but if you think about Wireless continuing to run next year at about the same level, I think Wireline will come down. We are coming towards the end of the FiOS build out. So directionally, I think overall CapEx spending will come down in 2011 from 2010. I think we've had tremendous disappointment within the business around all of our CapEx spending, not only on core network, but on systems and supporting infrastructure. And we've also gotten much more efficient. A portion of our CapEx is labor, it's not just material. And we've gotten more efficient with that. So I think we're in a good position to continue posting very strong cash numbers in free cash flow. The upgrade level, we're very pleased with the upgrade level that 9.5% of our base upgraded in the quarter. Upgrades are a key focus for us. And as I think about it, upgrades right now are all good, and will be all good for quite a while to come, because a lot of times it's a feature phone customer going to a smartphone customer. I'm willing to take that equipment for us and that subsidy when I'm getting 2x the revenue. So it's not an issue that we're concerned about, we see it much more as an opportunity in providing upside to us in terms of revenue growth and profitability.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.: Just two more if could on FiOs and sorry to beat the horse a little bit, John. But when we've been talking about FiOS winding down, there's been a very specific number that we would save about $2 billion a year in Wireline CapEx. And I guess it kind of sounds like may be you're already starting to realize some of that as you've been winding that down may be sooner than expected. So could you put more specific numbers, as this thing comes to an end in 2010, what the dollar savings should be from that project relative to the $2 billion you guys have been talking about for a couple of years? And then I guess the second part is now that FiOS is 60% of the footprint and 50% of the revenue of the wireline unit, could you give us more color about what are the margins now on this business and how does its growth either benefit or dilute wireline margins as we model that out into the next couple of years?\nJohn Killian: Let me hit a couple of things here is, we have said in the couple billion dollar range, we are realizing some of that this year because we had been building at a $2 million premise passed roughly, and we're going to build roughly $1 million this year. So in our program this year, we've seen some benefit there. We will continue to see that as we go into 2011 and 2012. But the message here is, I think we become more efficient with the capital spend, our cost per home passed has been very good. We're very pleased with that and I think overall, I think the direction of CapEx spend will be down as we go into next year. From a margin perspective, we're very pleased with where we are. FiOS overall, we're very pleased with. We are up, income-positive here. We continue to grow that this quarter, because we ramped up and had more net adds than we had had in previous quarters. That had some impact in terms of the ability to expand the margin in this particular quarter. It is overall accretive to the margins of the overall business. We don't put out specific numbers and we're not going to do that right now, Dave. But the good news here is, we accelerated penetration with the changes Fran has really led, putting in place. We feel we're in a better position from an acquisition standpoint. There's a lot more buzz around the FiOS capability and the quality of video vis-\u00e0-vis our competition. So we think we're very well positioned and FiOS is continuing to do well.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.: Is that 50% of the revenues in the wireline business, is the margins in that higher or lower than the reported margins for the unit?\nJohn Killian: It's higher than the reported margins, Dave.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: You got a question earlier about how you're seeing this ramp in smart phone adoption. We're still seeing really strong wireless margins. And I think that that has been depriving to a lot of people in that the adoption of smartphones had kind of compressed margins in a lot of other operators, first, because you take (sub-Zs) upfront, and then you started getting a lot of these sort of network abusers who are using more than what they're really paying for under an unlimited plan. So I guess sort of the question here is, what could cause your margins to take a step backwards as we continue to scale in the data world? Could it be an investment you'd be willing to make in a new device category? Is there something incremental you'd want to do on the network side that you haven't done yet or really sort of sketched out for us yet? Or do you think that you can continue to run at these record levels of EBITDA margins even as you see accelerated usage of your data services?\nJohn Killian: I have to thank you, because you have not broken the record that I've had on every call, a question very much like this. Good question. About the question going to sustainability of our margins in the wireless business, as you know, we're very pleased. Low McAdam whose new President and Chief Operating Officer likes to describe us as an 'and' company not an 'or' company. So it's both growth and profitability, and we've always said that. The 47.2 is 157 basis points up year-on-year; it's comparable sequentially. We believe that really reflects the superior execution and scale of the ethics that our wireless team has built over several years. We've build tremendous scale in that particular business. We're able to absorb more subsidies and continue to do really a very strong job on margins. Now a couple of points here I'd make is, this is not a one-trick pony result. If you look at revenue, we have a very nice improving revenue trend in the wireless business. Service revenue in the fourth quarter was up 5%, first quarter 5.8%, second quarter 6.3%, and third quarter 7.7%. And that's only with 23% of our customers having smartphones today. So we believe as we go through the next several years and we go up that smart phone adoption, we're going to be able to grow revenue, grow profitability. We think our network is very well positioned for the growth in data traffic. We put tremendous time and focus on this, with Lowell and Dan Mead and Tony Malone on making sure we're well-equipped. Our assumptions assume that our handset lineup that we think is very strong today, where we put all the emphasis on again the Droid franchise. And the Droid franchise is unique to Verizon. It positions us very well; in our handset lineup we'll get better over time. It's not going to take a step backwards; it will continue to be enhanced. And is it possible we have a quarter where there's a knockout device that has some impact on margins? There's always a possibility of that happening; we've acknowledged that in the past. And that would be a good thing to have happened because of what you would do from a smart phone adoption in your overall ARPU. Now the other part of this is our wireless team is not only focused on net adds and growth and ARPU, tremendous focus on driving efficiency in the business, they've been working on driving cost out of supply chain. You've seen the tremendous results they've had this year on lowering their inventory level. At a time you have new product introductions focused on driving cost out of customer service, driving more online interactions, eliminating things like other charges and credit OCCs controlling them, retail store efficiency. So we think the scale we built in that business allows us to continue to have the lead in the industry on margins, and we not going to give that up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: What do you think revenue growth can do for next couple of years? You've always been accelerating up. Do you see the business as kind of a 3% or 4% revenue grower? And may be related to that, how much did you wholesale pricing changes impact revenue in the quarter? And I have a brief follow up if you don't mind?\nJohn Killian: Yes, okay. So, Tim, generally, I absolutely think we can accelerate revenue growth from where we are today. I mean I think the wireless business on a service ARPU at 7% can get up in the high single digits and can touch 10% with data growth. The wireline revenue picture looks a little worse this quarter than it really is. We posted in number of 3.6%, but a major driver on that going a little bit worse from last quarter was, we made some price changes in our International Wholesale business, because we had certain roots out in the world that really weren't driving profitability. So when you look at our International Wholesale revenue, it was down year-over-year by 28%. If you strip that out, our Wireline revenue was only down 2.4% versus the 3.6% that we reported. And then as you cut under that, Consumer is growing at the rate of 1.1%; we saw a better performance on small business. Our Enterprise revenue, while it was negative-0.8%. If you break FX out, it was flat. So the underlined trends, even in the Wireline business, are better than, we think the 3.6% number would show. And I think, we believe, we can get the Wireline business, over the next couple of years with some help from the economy, to flat, and may be to slightly growing. And if we do that, that would be very important for the business overall, because Fran talked about it no question. We still have the lot of ability to drive more and more cost out. But we got to get that business growing again, and we're very focused on that and we think we can. But the Wireless business, there's going to be tremendous opportunity to continue to accelerate the revenue growth on that business.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: John, just on your wireless business, you clearly have a premium network out there. Do you think when you get the iPhone, you can charge a premium price either for the device or for the service or some kind of application sharing? We're not asking when you're getting the iPhone, but clearly there would be a huge benefit for subscribers being on your network versus your competitor.\nJohn Killian: Well, I talked earlier, Tim about how we think about pricing. So we're very focused on the device line up we have today. We think we have a great device line up. The Droid franchise has gone from nothing a year ago, to where it really has a buzz and a lot of momentum out on the marketplace right now. From a pricing perspective, we think the brand that we have built puts us in a unique position from a pricing perspective. We've always been a bit at a premium, and we think the brand will allow us to continue to do that.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Chris Larsen of Piper Jaffray.\nChris Larsen - Piper Jaffray: A question back to FiOS, you obviously picked up some share or it appears based on with the cable companies said that you picked up some share both on video and on data. My question is really, there has been a lot of back and forth there, have you begun to see anything so far in the fourth quarter that indicates the cable companies were getting more aggressive either on their video or the data pricing? And then additionally, there were some comments made actually in the New York Post recently that cable is considering a massive increase or a material increase in their high speed data prices to offset some of this over the top video that maybe going on. If cable were to do that, is that something you guys would follow along with that is a large increase or a material increase in your data pricing?\nJohn Killian: I think, Chris, a couple of thoughts here is, the FiOS video business and internet business, we've always said every quarter it's a very competitive out there. I wouldn't say we've seen anything recently that changes the competitive landscape from an offer or a price perspective. With the changes that Fran has led for us on the worry-free guarantee, the contract, no focus on the MDU, we think we're in a very good possession. We haven't planned any price changes here at this point in time; we would always continue to look at what's happening in the competitive landscape. We think our FiOS offering from, based on the fiber end to end is a superior offering from a quality standpoint. And we've been focused very much on acquisition and getting people to move. So we would continue to evaluate that and look at what the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth.\nOperator: Your last question comes from James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital.\nJames Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital: One on capital structure and the other on FiOS. On the FiOS side for broadband, where are the ads coming from? I know a material portion in the past have been people being switched from DSL to FiOS, is that continuing? And is the mix changing in terms of DSL switches versus people coming presumably over from cable? And secondly on the capital structure side, if you're looking at dividend in cash up from Verizon Wireless, how much of a buffer do you have in terms of realized and taxed proportional profits of Verizon Communications that haven't actually represented cash dividend is up for Verizon Wireless? So in other words, how much could you dividend end up form VZW before you start to actually have to pay incremental tax on those payments?\nJohn Killian: Let me just start with the capital structure. We are very pleased with our cash performance. We think the wireless business, you can see it's a cash machine, the cash generation of that business is not going to decelerate, if anything, it's going to accelerate. We're in a very good position from that perspective. We believe that Verizon dividend is extremely safe. There is not a major tax issue here that I'm worried about that's going to have some impact on this. So we think we are in a good position. Fran and his team has had a lot of focus on trying to make the Wireline business more free cash flow positive. We'll continue to work at that. But our cash flow margin is in a very good position, and you can see it from this quarter. Fran will comment on the FiOS question.\nFran Shammo: On the migration question. Yes, we continue to migrate some of our former DSL customers into the FiOS broadband. But if you look at our net ads, if you take the internet net ads form our FiOS product less our DSL, we're still on a positive take share perspective. The other thing to consider too is, is that when you look at the penetration of our internet at 31 and our TV at 27, what we find is once we convert someone over to our FiOS internet product with the speed that we have and the amazement that they get from that, it's very easy for us to then walk in behind that and convert over the TV because we can bundle it and save them money. So I think that we do have migration from DSL, but we are also taking share.\nJohn Killia: Just a couple of things then wrap up here. I hope you can see that we feel very positive about the performance of the business this quarter. We had given you some direction that we felt we needed to do about where earnings would be in the second half of the year.And in this quarter, we are at the very high end of that range; that's our focus for the fourth quarter. We will continue to deliver in the fourth quarter the kinds of things we delivered here; strong wireless results driven by continuing ARPU acceleration and stronger smartphone results. We've stabilize the Wireline business from a margin position. We'd actually expanded them slightly in this quarter. We believe that will accelerate as we get into the fourth quarter. and our cash flow position is very strong and will remain very strong. So I thank you for taking the time, I'll pass back to John just to close up the clock.\nJohn Doherty: Well that concludes our call today. Thanks to everyone for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-07-23 11:23:13", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - SVP, IR John Killian - CFO\nAnalysts: John Hodulik - UBS. Mike McCormack - JPMorgan Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley David Barden - Bank of America Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank Tim Horan - Oppenheimer\nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non- GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss for the second quarter of $0.07 per share. These quarterly results include a total of $0.65 of non-operational or one-time charges which are listed on slide four. The largest items relates to the recognition of costs in connection with our wireline force reduction initiative primarily for severance, special termination benefits and pension charges. These costs totaled $2.3 billion pre-tax and resulted in a charge to earnings of $0.52 per share. Roughly $1 billion of the pre-tax amount is for additional severance liabilities as a result of the enhanced incentive offer. The remaining $1.3 billion of pre-tax costs are non-cash and relate to the recognition on special termination benefits and pension plan liabilities for the effective employees. We also incurred non-operational costs in connection with the spin-off of our access line properties to Frontier. As we previously discussed, these costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. In the second quarter, these get-ready costs amounted to $195 million pre-tax or a charge of $0.04 per share. Another item we've been pointing out for you is our merger integration cost related to Alltel. During the second quarter, charges related these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. In addition, the sale of the Alltel divestiture properties resulted in a one-time tax expense worth about $0.04 per share. The last item that I would like to highlight is a one-time non-cash adjustment of $268 million primarily related to wireless data revenues. This adjustment was recorded to properly defer previously recognized wireless data revenues that will be earned and recognized in the following period. As the amounts involved were not material to our consolidated financial statements in any current or previous reporting period, the $268 million adjustment was reported entirely in the second quarter with an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues, which equates to $0.03 per share of earnings. Consistent with our reporting methodology, the items I just described are not included at the segment level primarily due to their non-operational or non-recurring nature. However, they are included in our reported consolidated results. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian.\nJohn Killian: Thanks, Ron, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some of my perspective to our second quarter results. Our results show that we continue to do a good job executing in our key focus areas. In terms of cash generation, we had an exceptionally strong quarter of cash flow growth with continued tight controls on capital spending. We saw a good customer growth in wireless where data revenue growth continues to be driven by smartphone sales to both new and existing customers. As a result, we saw increasing year-over-year growth in postpaid ARPU and improvements to our industry-leading customer retention metrics in this quarter. In wireline, our EBITDA margin improvement was driven by cost reductions. During the quarter, we had approximately 11,000 volunteers for our enhanced separation offer in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. So this will go a long way toward helping us achieve our wireline force reduction objectives for the year. Broadband and video continue to drive revenue results within the mass markets. Revenue trends in global enterprise improved again this quarter and showed positive year-over-year growth. And while we are seeing stability in underlying trends in the enterprise space, we are still seeing cyclical effects and remain cautiously optimistic with regard to a more meaningful economic recovery. Lastly, we completed the pending transactions that were part of our overall strategic transformation. During the second quarter, we closed the sale of the 105 markets we were required to divest as part of the Alltel acquisition in 2009. And on July 1, we completed the access line spin-off in merger transaction with Frontier. Through the spin-off, Verizon shareholders received $1.85 per share in value in the form of Frontier shares and cash in what was effectively a stock dividend. So it was an active quarter for sure, with solid overall performance. Let's now move to a detailed review of the quarter, starting on slide 4. As Ron indicated earlier, our second quarter earnings results included $0.65 of non-operational or one-time charges. With a reported loss of $0.07, you can see that the math gets us to a $0.58 quarterly result. For the first half of the year, we produced $1.13 in EPS before the effect of non-operational or one-time items. I'd like to add a little more detail on the wireless deferred revenue adjustment. Over the last several years, we have moved away from billing customers on a per use basis for data to billing on a pre-determined price for either a bundle of text messages, a certain amount of data usage or unlimited usage of data on smartphones. As such, certain data services are billed in advance for services to be provided in the next monthly cycle. Essentially, we are recording an adjustment related to prior periods in which we did not properly defer a portion of monthly billed revenues primarily for certain wireless data services that are billed in advance. The impact to the deferred revenue adjustment in any given quarter a year was not material. So reported revenue and growth trends were not materially overstated. In fact, had we done this appropriately, the largest single year impact would have been under $80 million. However, since the amount of deferred revenue related to these types of data services had grown progressively over time, the $268 million adjustment does negatively impact consolidated revenues and our growth rates in the second quarter. This is a one-time adjustment to reconcile our wireless deferred data revenue balance. Given the nature of this adjustment, it is not included in our wireless segment results and does not affect prior period comparisons at the segment level. Let me now spend a minute on the divested properties, which will no longer be part of our results in the second half of the year. First, on the Alltel divestiture markets or trust properties, as we refer to them, these markets were sold to two different buyers, and closed on two different dates during the quarter. The first sale closed in late April and the second one in late June. As such, our subscriber numbers at the end of the second quarter exclude the more than 2 million subscribers that we divested in these markets. Our quarterly financial results include these properties up until the date of each sale. But since both transactions closed during the quarter, our results do not reflect a full quarter of activity for the trust properties. The revenue impact of not having these wireless properties for the entire second quarter is about $100 million. We divested the Frontier properties on July 1, so those results are fully included in our second quarter. We will be providing pro forma historical information for our wireline and wireless segments to reclassify the impact of these dispositions in late August or early September. And I'll talk more about the impacts of these divested properties on our 2010 earnings outlook at the end of my remarks. Since a great deal of our earnings performance involves non-cash effects, let's turn our attention now to cash flow, which presents a much different growth picture. As I said earlier, our cash flow performance was quite strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $9.8 billion. Year-to-date cash flow from operations of $16.9 billion, is up 19.4%. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $5.5 billion, up more than 75%. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow of $.2 billion is up $3.1 billion or 52%. Our operational cash flow results continue to be very strong, and we have benefited from lower net tax payments. Looking at capital spending in total, we were down 3.6% in the quarter, and we are running 5% below 2009 on a year-to-date basis. So at this point in time, we iterate our previously stated full year 2010 guidance of capital expenditures between $16.8 and $17.2 billion. And as I previously said, we are reallocating capital between our segments, reflecting growth opportunities. This shift will continue as we move through the year. In wireline, CapEx in the second quarter was $1.8 billion, down almost 24%. Year-to-date, wireline CapEx of $3.3 billion is down nearly $1 billion, reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned, and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. In wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE network deployment and data capacity requirements. In the second quarter, wireless CapEx was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date we spent $4 billion, which is up $698 million or about 21%. Turning to the balance sheet, a top priority for us is to continue to reduce leverage. And we're doing well here with net debt of just under $53 billion at the end of the quarter, down $7.5 billion or 125% since the beginning of the year. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is about 1.5 times, and we're expecting it to be even lower by the end of the year. On July 1, we transferred $250 million of debt to Frontier and shortly thereafter used the $3.1 billion of cash from the spin-off to further reduce debt. Let's turn now to revenue trends, which are on slide six. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.8 billion, an $88 million or 0.3% decline versus last year. The deferred revenue adjustment that I covered earlier had a negative impact on growth of about 100 basis points. And the timing of the Alltel trust properties sales during the quarter had an unfavorable revenue impact of about $100 million. During the quarter, we saw revenue growth in our key areas, including wireless data, FiOS, strategic services within the global enterprise market. With that high-level snapshot of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with wireless on slide seven. In wireless, we had another strong quarter, with sequential improvement in revenue, ARPU, churn and profitability. Our revenue growth performance was strong with total service revenues up $697 million or 5.2% year-over-year. And when we look at our results without the Alltel trust properties, in other words on a pro forma basis, total service revenue growth was 6.2%. Our focus on expanding the data market drove data revenue growth of 23.8% compared with last year. Total data revenues grew to $4.8 billion this quarter and comprised 34.5% of total service revenues. And total data ARPU grew 16.1% year-over-year. Our strategy is focused on continuing to take advantage of the rapidly growing smartphone device category. Our approach is to support a number of different operating systems and platforms and to offer a robust line-up of devices, which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers, but upgrade our existing customers. In addition to improving ARPU and customer retention, we believe this approach will drive sustained data revenue growth. And we continue to be very bullish about this opportunity. For starters, we see a plenty of upside in terms of data penetration. At the end of the second quarter, 35% of our retail postpaid base had smartphones or multimedia devices, up from just under 31% at the end of the first quarter and 26% at yearend. 20% of our postpaid customers have smartphones and 15% have multimedia devices. The DROID franchise has been a great success. We have a steady stream of devices featuring the Android operating system since the first DROID was introduced last fall. To date, we have six devices with multiple manufacturers in our current device line-up with more to come. The Incredible was introduced late in the second quarter, and we began selling the new DROID X on July 15. Both devices have sold very well and customer feedback has been terrific. We have had some backorder issues, but this is more timing than anything else. Customer demand and interest in the smartphone category has never been greater. Demand is being driven by the proliferation of new devices with greater capabilities in innovative applications and content. We feel really good about our device portfolio with great momentum going forward. Looking ahead, particularly with the commercial launch of LTE later this year, we believe that our network advantage will become even more evident and differentiate us more than ever before. Let's now talk about our customer growth results. We displayed our customer activity on slide eight. So you can clearly differentiate the second quarter net add growth from the effectively Alltel trust properties subscriber adjustments. We had a good quarter in terms of growth, adding 1.4 million net new customers with 665,000 retail postpaid net adds and 896,000 reseller additions. In the postpaid market, we competed very well this quarter with a strong device line-up. Our increased focus on customer retention drove an excellent sequential improvement in postpaid churn of 13 basis points. Our net add performance in the reseller channel was also very good, especially since the second quarter is typically seasonally lower in this customer category. As we've said, the reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended this quarter with 92.1 million customers, which as you know is substantially retail postpaid, representing 89% of total customers. And as we identified beginning last quarter, the other connections category is where we will be including all kinds of machine-to-machine devices such as vehicle tracking, telematics, e-readers, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions and medical alert devices. Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on slide nine. Our key focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market where we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage and penetration. Retail service revenues grew 4.2% in the quarter. Retail post paid ARPU increased 1.2% compared with the year ago, effectively doubling the year-over-year accretion we saw in the first quarter. This accretion is driven by data plans and the increasing percentage of customers using smartphones and multimedia devices. Device upgrades were strong once again, with about 9% of our post paid customers upgrading in the second quarter. Customers continue to respond very well to our portfolio of smartphones and multimedia devices. About 40% of device sales from our direct channels were smartphones with a $30 monthly data plan and 17% were from multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached. Our strategy of stimulating data revenue growth is also improving customers retention. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent. The improvements were most notable in retail post paid with churn under 1% and improving seven basis points year-over-year. In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA up 7.8% from a year ago. Our second quarter service EBITDA margins expanded to 47.5% driven by strong data revenues, churn improvements and the continued benefit of Alltel synergy savings. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail post paid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices which will further expand the data market. Let's move to our wireline segment on slide eleven. On the consumer side, broadband and video products continued to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew more than 33% year-over-year and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $145 is up 7% over second quarter last year. On the enterprise side, growth in strategic services, which includes security IP and other managed solutions continue to transform the revenue mix. In wholesale, revenues were impacted by secular pressures and the effect of international pricing changes. Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on slide twelve. This time last year, FiOS made up about one-third of consumer revenue. FiOS revenues now represent more than 43%. Within consumer, the strength of our broadband and video products together with our increasing sale should continue to drive positive revenue and ARPU growth and offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 0.3% versus last year, and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $80 this quarter up 11.4% from a year ago. In terms of customer growth we saw a sequential improvement in net additions in both FiOS TV and internet. At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 3.2 million FiOS TV customers adding 174,000 this quarter compared with 168,000 in the first quarter. Our FiOS TV penetration is 26% based on about 12.4 million homes open for sale. On the broadband side, we added 196,000 new FiOS internet customers this quarter compared to 185,000 in the first quarter, bringing our total to 3.8 million. And with about 12.9 million homes open for sale, FiOS internet penetration is 30%. Adding a high speed internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with 9.3 million broadband connections. Let's move next to our business markets on slide thirteen, which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macro economic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global enterprise revenue showed positive sequential in year-over-year growth up 1.1% versus first quarter and 0.6% versus second quarter last year. Our revenue performance was helped by strong CPE sales in network and solutions based services. Strategic services, which represent about 40% of global enterprise revenue grew 6.2% year-over-year and 3.5% sequentially. I'd say we are seeing some signs of stabilization, we're still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any meaningful change. In global wholesale revenue declines were worst than trend, down 8.3% year-over-year and just under 5% sequentially. Domestically, revenues continued to be impacted by secular pressures. Internationally we made a decision to increase voice pricing in certain routes, which resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market. Let's cover wireline profitability next. In the second quarter, we were able to improve the EBITDA margins by about 100 basis points sequentially to 22.7%. The improvement was primarily driven by wage related savings and third party interconnection costs in the quarter. We're making good progress in our workforce reduction initiative. Wireline headcount was down 3,800 in the second quarter and 6,100 year-to-date. As I mentioned earlier, we had approximately 11,000 acceptances our enhanced incentive offer in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. About two-thirds of these employees went off-payroll in late June or early July, with the remainder leaving the business later in the third and fourth quarter, as we carefully manage the transition with a focus on customer service. The benefits of these actions should help our margins in the third and fourth quarters. We are also considering additional force reductions in other locations within the telecom business. We should know more about this by the end of the third quarter. As far as our other cost reduction initiatives, we're also making progress in real estate, network convergence, supply chain, inventory management and energy. We have a well organized and realistic plan, and I'm confident that we will capture these savings. We'll also continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital spending. To sum up, we had a solid quarter with exceptionally strong cash flow. We will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. Our wireless results were solid. And in wireline, our cost reduction initiatives resulted in margin improvement. And we successfully completed our pending transactions by closing the sale of the Alltel trust markets during the quarter and divesting the access line properties to Frontier on July 1. The Frontier transaction culminates a strategic transformation that we've undergone since the inception of Verizon 10 years ago. During this process, we have aligned our company with the major growth trends driving our industry. We have simplified the business by divesting our directories business, monetizing our international equity investments and spinning off certain access line properties. We have restructured through strategic acquisitions and investments, significantly increased our exposure to the growth areas of the future, wireless, broadband and global connectivity. In wireless, we've increased our scale through acquisitions, purchased the valuable spectrum and invested in new technologies that will position us to capture growth in the rapidly evolving mobile broadband space. We've changed our revenue mix in wireline, reinventing our technology base with fiber and expanding our global presence through acquisition to meet the growing demand of enterprise customers for the global connectivity. In short, we've positioned ourselves to be a stronger competitor in areas of higher growth and minimized our exposure to areas of the business that are more challenged by secular change. The revenue pie on slide 16 highlights our current revenue mix. The first observation is that 83% of our consolidated revenues come from wireless and global business customers. Secondly, the wireline mass market business comprises only about 16% of our current revenues, with the majority of our households covered by FiOS. So the net result of the strategic investments and divestitures that we've made is an outstanding set of high-value assets with greater potential for revenue growth. We are also confident that over the long term, we can grow profit and shareholder returns. In the short term, I realize that the impact in timing of these divestitures make estimating 2010 earnings more difficult. So in addition to providing pro form historical information soon, I would like to offer investors some thoughts about the impacts of these divestitures in my outlook for the second half of the year. Before non-operational and one-time items, we had $1.13 of earnings per share in the first half of the year. The assets we spun off to Frontier and the Alltel trust properties accounted for approximately $0.12 of first half earnings. So excluding these properties, we had $1.01 of earnings per share. Our goal is to grow earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from this first half adjusted base of $1.01. In the second half of this year, we expect a continuation of the trends we're experiencing in our wireless business. We believe we can continue to grow the business in terms of net adds and drive higher smartphone adoption, leading to accelerating ARPU accretion and revenue growth. In addition, we will continue to make great progress managing costs. You saw the strong service EBITDA margin that we delivered in the first half, and we expect to continue this performance. In our wireline business, although we don't expect any significant economic driven improvements in the second half, we will continue to accelerate the success in the cost reduction programs you saw in the first half. Virtually all of the benefit associated with our incentive offer to associates will be reflected in our second half results. In addition, we continue to make great progress in other areas such as reducing our overall access costs and delivering on all of our other cost reduction initiatives. So again, a good quarter. We are optimistic about the outlook for the second half of the year and we are confident in the long-term potential of the business. With that, I'll turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions.\nRon Lataille: Thank you, John. Brad, if you could open up the lines for questions?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik : I guess, John, first maybe a follow-up to some of the guarantees you just gave. So I'm doing the math right; it would sort of suggest that on a non-pro forma basis, you are talking in the 220 to 226 range for 2010 and on a pro forma basis more like 208, 209 to 214. These are sort of quick numbers. But I guess given the 5% to 10% range, is that sort of in the ballpark.\n UBS.: I guess, John, first maybe a follow-up to some of the guarantees you just gave. So I'm doing the math right; it would sort of suggest that on a non-pro forma basis, you are talking in the 220 to 226 range for 2010 and on a pro forma basis more like 208, 209 to 214. These are sort of quick numbers. But I guess given the 5% to 10% range, is that sort of in the ballpark.\nJohn Killian: If you take, John, the first half earnings of the $1.13 and then I indicated that you strip out the impact, so if you look at the Frontier contribution, that's in the range of $0.08 to $0.09 in the first half of the year. Trust properties are in the range of $0.03 to $0.04. Combined, it's about 12. So if you strip that away, it's $1.01. What we are saying is we will grow 5% to 10% off of the $1.01.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS.: So $1.06 to $1.11 and that you add that back to the $1.14.\nJohn Killian: You're doing the math and you can make it work. And add that to the $1.13 in the first half of the year, and you'll get to a range.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: I guess my real question is around margins. On the wireline side, you had some nice performance in the quarter. You went through some of the issues there. I know you don't have pro forma out yet for the deal. But given the progress you've made on the cost saving side, are we still expecting about 200 basis point decline in margins on a sequential basis or does some of the cost savings continue to kick in and maybe sort of offset some of that impact on the second half?\nJohn Killian: We will be putting pro forma result out, as we've mentioned, late August early September. The initial impact as you strip out Frontier is around a couple of hundred basis points. Now, as we've said on the call and we've said on past calls, within the wireline business, we are extremely focused on driving costs out of that business. We had very strong performance in the second quarter. I had indicated on the first quarter call that we thought that was the case. Force benefits, sequentially we had some wage-related savings principally on the over-time side. We did not see any of the benefit really in the quarter from the 11,000 force reduction that we've got with the associate offer. So most of the individuals who went off in the second quarter were late in the quarter. We had some more in early July. That was a little over 7,000 of the 11,000 went off there. We should see those benefits in the second half of the year. So we believe we can improve wireline margin in the second half of the year off of the pro forma wireline margin that we'll be putting out, and we feel good about those initiatives. Every cost line is being attacked in the wireline business; our third-party access cost, our telco cost, our big area of focus, obviously all the headcount items are a strong area of focus. We are seeing improvements in real estate expense. We have vacated some buildings. Most recently, we terminated the lease in Philadelphia on 1717, Arch Street which was a fairly sizeable commitment for us. So we think we have a lot of opportunity to drive cost reduction on the wireline side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of JPMorgan.\nMike McCormack - JPMorgan: Congratulations, Ron as much as I might be selfish, I hope to hear you in October as well. John, on the wireless margin side, can you just give us some sense on what the drivers are for cost reduction? Obviously a very strong net add quarter, gross adds pretty flat sequentially. Looks like a pretty good take-down in SG&A. Is there some part of that that come out with divested property, and what should we be thinking about for a good run rate there? And then secondly, with the Vodafone issue looming at some point maybe next year or 2012, wireline CapEx, looks like it's down year-to-date about $1 billion year-over-year. How far can we get that down over the next year or so?\nJohn Lataille: Okay, Mike, couple of thoughts for you. Clearly, I think you can see from the call that our wireless business is really firing on all cylinders. And we think there is substantial opportunity ahead of us to continue that performance. We are in the early innings of wireless data with only 20% of our base having a smartphone, and then with LTE a whole set of opportunities around video. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to accelerate top-line performance as we go through the second half of the year and into 2011. Now, couple of thoughts for you. The wireless team is extremely focused on all areas of cost. If you look actually at the headcount, they are down year-on-year about 8,000 people. Now a couple of thousand of those are related to the trust properties. There's a little bit of other ones in terms of leave of absence, those kinds of things. But net-net, we're down 4,000 to 5,000 people. They have a series of initiatives within the wireless business that's focused on their distribution side of the business. That's driving more efficiency, more online transactions. Again, an area where we think we are very early in the process of driving that out. Another area that they have a lot of attention is all of the cost and expenses around managing supply chain inventory levels and just the whole process there. So, you know, just about every area of the wireless side. Again, like wireline, they are attacking the underlying cost structure. We are very pleased with the margin performance in the second quarter, and think we are in a good position to continue to drive both growth and profitability in that business.\nMike McCormack - JPMorgan: Okay. And on the wireline CapEx?\nJohn Lataille: On the wireline CapEx, we indicated Mike, our guidance was 16.8 to 17.2 for the full year on CapEx. You can see in the last two quarters, we have had a big shift where more of our spending is going to wireless than wireline. So we are taking wireline down this year. I expect that trend to continue as we go into 2011. I think we can take another fight out of it down next year. I'm not going to size that right now, because we're early in the process. But I think our overall CapEx spending, as we look at 2011 will be down from where we are today, although we will keep a pretty strong allocation to the wireless side. As you know, the wireless side being fueled by LTE and by data.\nMike McCormack - JPMorgan: John, your comments on the wireless SG&A side, it sounds like the bias would be towards flat to down on SG&A for the balance of the year.\nJohn Lataille: Very focused on driving more and more cost out the wireline side on SG&A; absolutely. And on the back of the 11,000 volunteers we had on our East Associate offer, I should mention that we are going to do some additional offers in the rest of Verizon in the second half of the year in our, what used to be the West, which is really California, Texas, and Florida. So we would expect to get some additional force reductions from that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: On the dividend outlook, you've always had some strong cash flow performance. You've got a positive outlook for the second half of the year. But on the other hand you also distributed a dividend, effectively with Frontier with a lot of cash generation. So how should we think about your upcoming decision in September around continuing that annual dividend increase, or are there some sort of one-time factors this year? And then we've had AT&T with tier data pricing. You've got a lot of smartphone load now. LTE is coming up. What are your current thoughts on tiered data pricing?\nJohn Killian: So, Simon, just a couple of thoughts for you. Yes, cash flow is tremendously strong, better in the quarter than even we expected. The team has a tremendous amount of effort and attention there. It's driven principally from operating performance. A part of that was, I hope you noticed, the working capital benefits, because the operating team is very focused on managing inventory levels and all of your days sales outstanding, all of the components that drive cash flow in the business. And I think we're performing extremely well here. So on the dividend side, as you know, that's a Board decision. The Board will consider that in September. I think we put them in a position where they have some pretty good alternatives there from the dividend perspective given the cash flow performance. But at the end of the day, that will be their decision. On pricing, we're performing extremely well right now. If you look at our data revenues this quarter, they're up about 24% year-on-year. If you look at data ARPU for our postpaid base, they're up over 19%. Again, as I said to you earlier, a lot of upside potential there given where we are on smartphones and multimedia devices in the future. We have indicated in the past, as we move to an LTE world and LTE pricing, we will probably look very hard at tiered pricing, and that continues to be our thinking right now. So more to come on that. By the way, I should say that all of our assets, all of our plans on getting LTE launched in the fourth quarter are on schedule. We feel very good about that. We think that's going to open up the whole new set of opportunities to continue to grow this wireless business that is again performing very well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America: John, first, could you talk a little bit about the one part of the wireless that seemed to be maybe a little on the soft side, which was the retail prepaid? It seems like you guys have kind of transferred the economics of being a retail prepaid provider in wireless over to your wholesale relationship with TracFone. That relationship has been on for a year now. I was wondering if you could kind of talk to us about your takeaways and some of the experiments you're doing with the $50 unlimited plan in the Southeast.\nJohn Killian: Dave, overall from a growth perspective in wireless, I'm very satisfied, 1.4 million net adds. On the last quarter call, a lot of people were suggesting that the postpaid market was coming to its end. And we thought there was still a lot of life there for Verizon and we did a lot better in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. So we feel very good about our position in the postpaid marketplace. That is our prime strategy. The device lineup [roll] and his team have done a tremendous job with the device lineup. The whole DROID franchise is performing extremely well. We introduced the Incredible, as you know, in the second quarter. We just launched the DROID X. There's more devices to come. So we think our handset lineup is very well positioned. Now we've also suggested that we decided to play more of the prepaid marketplace, not exclusively. We have our own prepaid offerings that have benefits in terms of handsets and customer service, but that we were playing more of that end of the market through the reseller opportunity. By the way, not just the Straight Talk offering. There is several different resellers, and we've been very satisfied with that. I mean it's fueled some nice growth for us as we've gone through the past year. The ARPU levels run significantly higher than the traditional reseller offerings we have had. The profitability from the tiered margin percentage basis is pretty good, because you don't have the marketing cost and a lot of the SG&A. So we think that strategy has worked well for us, and we're continuing to do that. There's always some seasonal fluctuation there from a reseller model. Now, on the prepaid offering that you said, it's just a trial in the South. It's targeted to a specific geographic area. There's not a plan at the moment to bring that nationally. From time-to-time, our e-readers do different things to see what kind of reactions, kind of experiments, and that's what that is all about, nothing more than that.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America: If I can just follow-up on the tiered pricing also, obviously you had a good quarter in postpaid. The new iPhone and the pricing changes came out at the end of second quarter. Now that you've had some time to assess the market and what the tiered pricing plan has been for AT&T versus you guys now without it, how compelling an offer do you feel it is, how competitively imperative is it that you do something along those lines? Or is it mostly just a capacity management.\nJohn Killian: It's very early days since that change went in. What I would tell you is our business continues to reform extremely well. Our smartphone lineup is being very well received. Our DROID lineup, we have been keeping the DROIDs in stock, by the way. We don't have a big supply problem here. There's a little bit of a delay in fulfillment, but we're in a good position there. So our business is continuing to perform extremely well, you haven't seen us rush out to make any kind of a change. We'll continue to monitor the situation of course and look at opportunities that will say what's the best equation for us to drive long term shareholder value and we'll be very focused on that. I can't say enough though about the opportunity we see ahead given where we are today with smartphone penetration. I mean I think 20% of our base today, where's that number going, ultimately is it 80%. Some people could argue everyone is going to have a smartphone ultimately, because that's the kind of device that's going to be. So I think there is tremendous opportunity to continue to drive and create value through Verizon wireless.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.\nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: Just wanted to follow on the cost side, I think it was the last call. Started to decide the opportunity for cost cutting over the next two year and if I remember correctly, it was the comment was at least $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Based on the efforts you've made in the second quarter, can you give us an update in terms of the size of the opportunity and what percent of that you think you can realize in 2010 versus 2011?\nJohn Killian: So, Mike, I'm not going to resize the number for you. What I would tell you is, is our confidence on the ability to drive cost out of the entire business, both wireline and in the wireless business too, has never been stronger. I mean I think we've come off a quarter where we've had very good performance. If you look at our business year-over-year, we're down about 24,000 people in total from an absolute basis, a big chunk of those coming out in the first half of this year, more coming out in the second half of the year. By the way we also transferred a little over 9,000 people with the Frontier transaction that we just completed. So I think we're in a very good position. The organization knows how important it is to resize the cost structure. So we feel very confident about our ability to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Maybe a couple of questions, first on enterprise trends, the results seem to indicate share shift in your favor. I'm wondering, you obviously talked about the macro, but can you talk about what you're saying in the competitive marketplace? And then maybe second question just on wireless ARPU, good progress on post paid ARPU growth, accelerating the rate of growth as you moved up to 1.2%. But with the device refresh you got going on, it seems like we have a lot more upside. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the trajectory from here and we can see at least one tier in the industry approach 4% growth, do you think that's realistic for you?\nJohn Killian: Okay. Jason, a couple of thoughts for you, I mean yes. Enterprise we had better performance this quarter on a reported basis we were up which was very good. Now we had a couple of things that helped us there, we had a very strong CPE quarter. A lot of demand for equipment out there, which is good, I mean it drives some margin. We are doing some pricing change on the CPE lineup. We did a late second quarter early third quarter to drive a little bit of margin that might temper down the volume just a little bit as we go through the third quarter. When you underlie and strip out CPE and some of the other things, we did see improved performance in enterprise although it was still a little bit negative year-over-year. I wouldn't say we're seeing any big change from and economic standpoint at this point. I think you're hearing that from every call that's out there right now as maybe in the first quarter there was a little bit of an uptick with everything going on in Europe and other issues that's probably been a little bit of a pause in terms of purchase decisions. Right now we're hoping that will pick back up in the second half of the year, but from up here enterprise perspective, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter, but we have a little bit of caution as we go through the rest of the year in, again why it's so important to drive more and more cost out of the business, but at the same time very focused on driving more profitability in enterprise. In fact, as I look at our deals we signed in the second quarter versus the first quarter, margin was up about 250 basis point on those deals quarter-to-quarter. So I think that was a very good sign. From a wireless post paid ARPU, we think there is upside as we go through the next couple of years. our smartphone line up if you think about it over the last year we solved the problem with the DROID franchise where we were a little bit behind in terms of the smartphone lineup that is paying dividends for us right now. We expect those dividends to accelerate, that our lineup is going to do extremely well. I would love to see 3% to 4%, I think we will get better. I think the other company that you indicated, they do have a higher concentration of smartphones in their customer base than we do today. But that gap is going to close, because we've got great devices, great lineup and of course our distribution is a machine quarter-after-quarter. So I think you're going to see improving performance there. And it just comes back to the issue I said earlier is we believe there is tremendous opportunity to continue drive shareholder value in this business field principally on the wireless side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: First of all, I just want to congratulate Ron on the great opportunity and wish you well. Just want to go back quickly here to wireless margins. You gave a lot of color earlier about what you're doing particularly on the cost management side. You come in there I think at an all-time record this quarter in terms of EBITDA margin. And I just want to get a bit more color on what the ultimate goal here is. The cost savings initiative, is that designed to help you guys sustain what is a margin level that may be 200 to 300 basis point higher than normally people would have expected? Or are you really just trying to create capacity so that you can keep your foot on the gas in terms of driving data in terms of incurring the subsidies that you would get from higher smartphone sales and maybe the higher costs you're actually going to incur from running the LTE network?\nJohn Killian: I think from a wireless perspective, we've always been a very balanced company in terms of not just looking at top-line, not just looking at growth, really looking at all the levers to drive shareholder value. We still are in the same place. Since I've been on this job, I've said I think there is opportunity to continue to grow the wireless business very nicely. And we think growth is going to accelerate. We think there is not going to be a deceleration in growth. There is actually going to be a next wave fueled by data and video where growth is going to get better. But at the same time, we have the opportunity to take costs out of the model and become a more efficient provider. And Lowell and his team are extremely focused on that. So I like our position here from the wireless perspective and where we have the ability to go.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: You're doing a great job in smartphones. You're a little bit over half of your sales in your direct channel now or smartphones or other integrated devices. But based on your lineup, you can easily see that at 70% or 80% and notch it just in future. You're probably going to be incurring some additional costs as you get ramped on LTE. I am just trying to set expectations here in that should we assume that at some point that might create a little bit of incremental pressure on the margins or do you really feel comfortable the way you've done from the cost management side and kind of keep things in a range even as you ramp in those areas?\nJohn Killian: I feel very comfortable that we can both grow the top-line of the business and just continue to deliver the industry-leading profitability that we have delivered. There is no question there is going to be a higher take-up of smartphones and multimedia devices, but we're very well positioned for that. There is also a nice return from that, because they are higher ARPU-based customers. So I don't think anyone's network, anyone's distribution is better positioned to take advantage and drive it to the bottom-line than we are. And we're very focused on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: John, sort of beating the dead horse here, but one of your major competitors, when they started rolling out smartphones, they saw the margins getting depressed quite a bit. You're not seeing that now, and it sounds like you don't expect to see that. Is it because the DROID maybe has a lot lower subsidy than the DROID lineup than some of the other high-end smartphones are our there? And on that point, it sounds like you're saying that you're not going to see any supply chain problems with the DROID lineup in the second half of the year. Could you maybe just comment on that? And then just lastly, can you give us a bit of a regulatory update? Are you guys talking to the SEC about ways to avoid the Title II regulation discussions that are ongoing?\nJohn Killian: Because smartphone devices cost you more money, COGS is up. It's a nice trade-off here. And if you look at our machine in terms of what we built over time, we have the ability to manage that and absorb that and still drive good margins. And we believe we can. Now, if we had one quarter where we had 3 million DROID net adds, there is probably going to be a little bit of an impact, but I would take that impact because of what it's going to do ultimately for value and shareholder value. So we're focused, as we've always said, both on growth and profitability. We will continue to be focused on that. We are taking costs out of our supply chain process and we will continue to do that. We're managing inventory levels extremely tightly, which is appropriate. From a supply chain perspective on supply of smartphones, we need to manage through it, which we are. These are kind of global issues with certain devices, but we're in a good position here. We think we can fulfill the requirements we have as we go through the second half of the year. We're working extremely closely with all of our manufacturers, and we think we're extremely well positioned. The other comment I'd make, Tim, on the Washington front, yes, we're actively engaged, including Ivan and Tom Tauke and Randy Milch on all of the issues, both with the policymakers as well as other industry participants. We'll continue to watch this, and we're optimistic that this will come out in the right place for us and for the industry. But time will tell on that. So not a lot more that I could comment on there right now. We did complete the Frontier transaction. I know you're all anxious for pro forma. We'll get that out to you. But as we look back on that, that was a very, very good transaction for us and for Verizon. When we first announced the deal, there were about 4.8 million lines in those territories. As you know, we had a fixed value effectively. The value per line was about $1,791. By the time we completed the transaction, it was about $22,140 per line. So we're very satisfied with what we've done with the Frontier transaction. We think we've gotten very good value here for the Verizon shareholder, both in terms of the value they get in Frontier and the debt relief. So it's a transaction we're very pleased with. And our team I think did an outstanding job working with Frontier on all of the transition. I would also like to just publicly acknowledge Ron on this call. Many of you did that. He's done a terrific job for us over the last several years. We will be announcing his replacement shortly in August, and I think it will be a top-notch individual. And of course, that individual will have the guidance of Ron on what needs to be done here. So, Ron, I'd just like to thank you, and I know from the industry you'll be getting a lot of thanks.\nRon Lataille: Thank you very much, John. And, Brad, that concludes our call today, and thanks everybody for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2010, "date": "2010-04-22 14:54:09", "content": "Executives: Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations John F.

At this time all participants have been placed in listen only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.\nRon Lataille: Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I\u2019m Ron Lataille and with me this morning is John Killian our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our website.  I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non- GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. As we indicated on our last earnings conference call, beginning this quarter we are no longer adjusting reported earnings results. Instead, we are only reporting GAAP earnings, consistent with trends in corporate reporting. Of course we will continue to provide the detailed information you need to understand and analyze our reported results, including the identification of material, non-operational items. For the first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.14 per share. These earnings results include a total of $0.42 of non-operational charges, the largest of which is for reduced tax benefits related to retiree healthcare. This onetime, non-cash tax charge totaled $962 million or $0.34 per share. In addition, we incurred a non-cash charge of $0.03 per share related to pension settlement losses resulting from our previously announced separation plan. As you know, pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. We also incurred non-operational costs in connection with the spinoff of our local exchange business in 14 states. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, these costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. This quarter these get ready costs amounted to $0.04 per share. Lastly, we incurred $0.01 per share this quarter related to Alltel merger integration costs. I would also point out that all of these non-operational items are reported at the consolidated level and therefore do affect any comparison for wireless or wireline segment results to prior periods.  One last item I\u2019d like to mention relates to certain revenue reclassifications within the wireline segment, due primarily to business customer shifts between mass market, global enterprise and global wholesale. The largest shift involved businesses with 20 or more employees. These accounts are now being managed by our enterprise sales teams and the corresponding revenues will be reported on the global enterprise line. Revenue from businesses with less than 20 employees will continue to be included in the mass market line. Prior period history has been reclassified and is provided in the supplemental schedule and historical files on our website. These changes in revenue line item reporting did not have a significant effect on historical growth rates. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian.\nJohn F. Killian: Thanks, Ron, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the operational details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some perspective to the results for this quarter. In January, we outlined our key focus areas for 2010. In summary, we said that we expect to continue generating solid cash flows and maintain tight control over capital spending.  Second, we would continue to capitalize on our investments in wireless, FiOS and global IP networks to grow revenues and market share, drive deeper penetration and increase ARPU. Finally, we would remain focused on our cost structure, achieve meaningful cost reductions, and make sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in employment figures in the overall economy.  In the first quarter, we executed on the business plan we described to you. Free cash flow grew over 25% this quarter, driven by strong cash flow from operations and a lower capital spending. We saw good customer growth in wireless and FiOS and we may be seeing some positive early signs of recovery in the business markets. Revenue trends this quarter were better on a consolidated basis, as well as in the wireless and wireline segments. In wireless, data growth was particularly strong this quarter driven by the significant amount of smart phone sales and upgrades. We feel very good about our retail postpaid ARPU and customer retention performance this quarter. On the cost side, we continue to benefit from the synergy savings of the Alltel acquisition and wireless margins expanded this quarter. In our wireline segment we continue to be aggressive and persistent in our cost restructuring to preserve margins. Cost reductions of 5,000 last quarter and 2,300 this quarter resulted in cost savings of about $80 million in the first quarter. However, the continued economic pressures on the top line, incremental pension and retiree benefit costs, and a higher cost related to record setting storms, affecting much of our franchise territory, resulted in a lower margin.  My goal continues to be to stabilize the wireline margin this year. We are on track with our plans to accomplish this goal. I am confident that we can achieve this objective and expand margins in the future. Lastly, on the strategic front, our pending transactions involving the sale of the Alltel divestiture markets and the spinoff of access lines are both moving forward. With this as an overview, let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 and start our detailed discussion of the quarter. As Ron indicated earlier, our first quarter earnings results included the non-operational charges you see here. A majority being non-cash and related to deferred tax and pension expense recognition. Our cash summary presents a much different growth picture. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was strong, up 7.5% over last year. Our capital spending was down $251 million or 6.8%. Free cash flow at the end of the quarter was $3.7 billion up almost $750 million or 25.6%.  In wireline, first quarter capital expenditures of $1.6 billion were down $437 million year over year. In wireless, capital costs were higher by $219 million. Although we\u2019ve started the year conservatively, I\u2019d reiterate that our 2010 guidance for capital spending is in the $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion range. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, we continue to reduce leverage. In the first 3 months we\u2019ve reduced net debt by $1.7 billion and net debt is down more than 10% from a year ago.  Let\u2019s now turn to revenue trends, which are on Slide 5. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.9 billion, up 1.2% from the first quarter a year ago; a better growth rate than each of the last two quarters. This reflects improvements in both wireless and wireline. Wireless revenues were up $661 million or 4.4% driven primarily by data. Wireline revenues were down 2.9% this quarter due primarily to continued economic pressures in our business markets. FiOS revenue growth continues to be strong, up 40% year on year. This is the third consecutive quarter of lower year over year revenue decline in wireline.  With that snapshot of revenues, let\u2019s move to the segments next, starting with wireless on Slide 6. In the first quarter, total service revenues were up $770 million or 5.9% versus the year ago quarter and we saw strong sequential improvement of 2.2% which is the highest sequential growth rate we\u2019ve see in the last six quarters.  This revenue performance is of course driven by our strong focus on expanding the data market. Data revenues, which comprised one-third of total service revenues in the quarter, grew 26.4% year-over-year. Total ARPU was 18% higher than a year ago. In terms of the components of data growth, quarterly revenues from web and email services was $2.4 billion, up 43.5% from first quarter last year. Messaging revenues of $1.8 billion grew 16.2%.  Our strategy continues to center on taking advantage of the expanding smart phone category. Our approach has been to feature a number of different operating systems and platforms which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers, but aggressively upgrade existing customers to high end data capable devices.  In addition to the obvious benefits to metrics like ARPU and churn, this will drive sustained data revenue growth. We have plenty of upside in terms of data penetration. At the end of the first quarter, more than 30% of our retail postpaid base had 3G multimedia devices or smartphones, up from 26% at the end of 2009. 17% had smartphones and 13% had 3G multimedia devices. We believe customer demand for data mobility for connections not previously disclosed were counted in our subscriber metrics in the past. At the end of the first quarter we had 92.8 million customers and more than 100 million total connections. Our high quality customer base is heavily weighted toward retail postpaid customers which comprised 89% of our subscriber base. This customer segment remains our key focus as we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage in penetration. In the first quarter we added more than 1.5 million net new customers with 423,000 retail postpaid net adds and 1.3 million reseller additions. With regard to the change in mix, we typically see seasonal effects in the first quarter. In any given year the sequential decline in retail postpaid net adds between fourth and first quarter can be about 25% to 30%. This quarter the decline was magnified. But we did not see any significant shift in market share, overall porting ratios or any increase in churn. In fact our churn rates improved. Total churn showed declines both on a year over year basis and sequentially. In postpaid, churn posted a 6% improvement compared to the first quarter last year. I would also add that these improvements are from already remarkably low industry leading churn levels. Although total wireless market penetration is above 90%, we are still very bullish about our growth opportunities in the retail postpaid market. By continuing to strengthen our smart phone device lineup, in ordering differentiated services like NFL mobile and Skype mobile, we will stimulate upgrades within our existing base as well as attract and retain high value customers. Net adds in our reseller channel were very strong again this quarter which is not surprising given typical prepaid seasonality. The reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract the incremental prepaid customer. I would also remind you that we do not have unlimited pricing arrangements with our reseller partners. The new category \u2013 other connections \u2013 totals 7.3 million at this time and will include all kinds of machine to machine devices like vehicle tracking, telematics, e-readers, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions, medical alert devices, essentially anything that has a wireless chip in it. Looking ahead, particularly when we commercialize LTE, the proliferation of these types of devices will be another source of incremental wireless growth. As we\u2019ve mentioned in the past we have a separate organization dedicated to open development and Verizon wireless is taking a leadership role in facilitating and stimulating innovation in this area. Examples include nPhase which is our joint venture with Qualcomm to provide advanced M2M solutions, the establishment of the Verizon Technology Innovation Center in Waltham and the creation of the 4G Venture Forum. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 8. Our focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market. It is the largest and most important portion of our business. Retail service revenue -- which accounts for about 85% of total wireless revenues -- grew 5% in the first quarter on a year over year basis. As I mentioned earlier, our retail postpaid ARPU grew 0.6% versus the year ago quarter. This accretion is driven by our data growth strategy with an increasing percentage of our customers using smart phones and multimedia devices. Device upgrades were strong as 8.6% of our postpaid base upgraded in the first quarter representing an increase of almost 15% from a year ago. This is extremely positive from a churn and ARPU accretion perspective. Customers are responding very well to our portfolios, smart phones, and multimedia devices. 36% of device sales from our direct channels were smart phones with a $30 monthly data plan and 24% were from multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached. The pricing simplification we implemented in January is helping to drive some of these excellent metrics and the results were exactly what we anticipated. While we experienced the downward migration of customers from the $99 unlimited price point, we also saw a healthy migration of customers up to new $69 unlimited price point. Another positive development is an increasing percentage of gross adds or new customers opting for voice plans at 900 minutes per month or more, which obviously bodes well for revenue and ARPU. As [Lowell] described on the investor call in January, our goal is to drive further smart phone penetration and stimulate data growth; which will offset some of the voice declines. In addition, as we launch LTE later this year, having a large number of data customers provides us with a great opportunity to meet their increasing need for higher speed and more sophisticated application-based devices. The first quarter results indicate that this is the right strategy. Revenue growth improved, our key customer retention metrics improved, and we saw retail postpaid ARPU accretion. In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating 6.4 billion of EBITDA up 5.7% from first quarter last year. Our first quarter margin performance of 46% is a strong result, reflecting both lower retail gross additions and stronger upgrades to higher end devices. I think the wireless team did a great job this quarter driving this margin result given our aggressive upgrade strategy. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability, with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smart phones and other data devices which will further expand the data market. Let\u2019s move now to our wireline segment on Slide 10. As I mentioned earlier, we continued to see both cyclical and secular pressures in our wireline consumer and business markets, with total wireline revenues down 2.9% from a year ago. Our broadband and video products are driving a significant shift in our consumer revenue mix and we continue to be very pleased with the success of FiOS. FiOS revenues are up 40% and ARPU increased 5% year over year. Managed and IP services continue to transform the business revenue mix. In the first quarter, strategic services revenue and enterprise was up 4.2%. Let\u2019s take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 11. A year ago FiOS made up about 30% of our consumer revenue. At the end of this quarter, FiOS represented more than 41%, a significant increase in just four quarters. The strength of our broadband and video products continues to drive consumer revenue and ARPU growth. Consumer revenue in the first quarter grew 0.9% on a year over year basis and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU which increased to more than $78 this quarter, up 12.3% from a year ago. The entire FiOS initiative continues to be very successful and we saw very positive levels of customer additions for both FiOS TV and internet this quarter. We have surpassed the three million customer mark in FiOS TV, with 168,000 net adds this quarter, and with 12 million homes open for sale, penetration of FiOS TV is 25%. In FiOS internet we added 185,000 customers this quarter bringing our total to 3.6 million. With 12.6 million homes open for sale, internet penetration is 29%. Let\u2019s move next to our business markets on Slide 12 which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance. As you can see, revenue in each of these categories has been relatively stable for the last five quarters. As a result we\u2019re seeing improved comparisons on a year over year basis. Global enterprise revenues was down $57 million or 1.4% in the first quarter, compared with a 4.8% year over year decline in the fourth quarter. The steady increase in the number of private IT site activations is an encouraging indicator, as are CPE sales, which were higher than we typically see in the first quarter. Enterprise long distance usage volumes which have typically seasonal fluctuations show year over year growth for the first time in quite a while. All of these factors point to early signs of a recovery. That should help our review performance in future quarters.  Global wholesale revenue in the first quarter declined $69 million but 2.9% year-over-year compared with a 4.9% decline in the fourth quarter. While we continue to see growth in ethernet services related to wireless back wall, we are not seeing a pick-up in wholesale long distance usage volumes yet. Foreign currency effects this quarter were similar to what we have experience in the fourth quarter. So the key point here is that revenue is stable and there is some optimism for improved performance in a recovery starting in the second half of the year.  Let\u2019s cover wireline profitability next. From my perspective we\u2019re competing well in the market and we remain focused within the wireline segment on four key strategies, driving FiOS growth, improving enterprise, driving costs out, and capital efficiency. In the first quarter, the fundamental trends underline the overall wireline results have not changed. The secular changes in the consumer market and the impact of the economic downturn in our business markets are still quite evident and while wireline revenues are still declining it is at a lower rate which is positive.  The facts are that in the first quarter the sequential decline in wireline revenues was nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. We did realize about $80 million in savings this quarter attributable to force reductions. However, these savings were more than offset by a combination of cost pressures including, an unusually high amount of storm related costs and incremental pension and retiree benefit expenses. I am confident that as we go through the year we will be able to stabilize the wireline margin with a combination of better revenue performance and our cost restructuring efforts. Every line item of expense is being attacked within our wireline business.  Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key areas. First, head counts. In January I indicated that our plans were to reduce the wireline workforce by a similar level to what we achieved in 2009. A reduction of 10,000 people for example results in an annual run rate cost savings of about $600 million. In the first quarter we reduced our workforce by 2,300. Keep in mind that our teams have executed well in this area with more than 28,000 reductions since the beginning of 2008. Next, real estate. We have been doing an extensive amount of work rationalizing our real estate portfolio to reduce costs. This included plans to close facilities and reducing square footage, reductions in energy usage as well as facility maintenance savings. Our plan identifies roughly $125 million in cost savings in 2010 alone. Over the course of the next three years we plan to reduce our total square footage by about 10%.  Other initiatives involve cost savings from network convergence which include center consolidations, operating and support system eliminations and new technology efficiencies. We\u2019ve identified $100 million in projected savings here by the end of 2010. Other areas of projected savings include managing third part interconnecting, content costs and a variety of reduction initiatives associated with supply chain inventory management and energy. Over the course of the next two years we have plans in place to resize our cost structure and capture run rate savings in the range of $1.5 to $2 billion. Once again we have a well organized and realistic plan and I am confident that we will capture these savings.  To sum up, as we move into the second quarter we remain focused on the key areas I mentioned earlier. First, continuing to generate solid cash flows and maintaining tight control over capital spending. Second, continuing to capitalize our investments and wireless FiOS and global IP networks to grow revenue in market share, drive deeper penetration and increase output. and third remaining focused on our cost structure, achieving meaningful cost reductions and making sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in the employment rates and the overall economy.  Ron, I will turn it back to you now for questions. \nRon Lataille : Thanks John. Brad, John is now available to take questions. \nOperator:  Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS :  Maybe just a couple of quick questions on wireless. The growth seems to be draining out of the postpaid market in general pretty quickly. Is this a good sort of mix of net adds that we can expect between post paid and reseller going forward? And if so I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts including some pretty some pretty strong postpaid ARPU trends but what are the margin implications here, we typically in the past talked about sort of mid 40s but given this potential shift in growth going forward, how do you see margins playing out from here? \nRon Lataille :  Let me give you a couple of thoughts here on this. If you look at the quarter we gained 423,000 post paid customers. Typically the first quarter is down seasonally somewhere in the range of 20% to 30%. Obviously that was magnified in this quarter. We came off a very strong fourth quarter as you know where we had gained 1.1 million. Really, on the back of the strong introduction of the Droid and the Android based operating devices.  We had no really major new devices launched in Q1. The Android itself based operation system continues to do very well, in fact when you look at actually gross numbers we moved more of them in Q1 than we did in Q4 so we\u2019re very satisfied with what we would label as the Droid franchise and you\u2019re going to hear a lot more about that in the coming months, particularly with an important launch for us coming up shortly which is the HTC Incredible which the early reviews on is extremely positive.  Now the other thing in the quarter, we put a lot of emphasis around upgrades and we did see an uptick of about 15% in our upgrade level. Now that\u2019s great news for us, it\u2019s great news for ARPU, it\u2019s great news for retention and by the way we see a lot of ability with tailwinds there to continue to do well with that.  Now as we go forward, just a couple of thoughts for you, we believe we can do better from a post paid perspective than we did in Q1 that will be particularly on the backs of new product introductions. We are not ready to throw the towel in to say that postpaid growth is going to be substantially lower now, by the way we recognize where penetration is, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have $2 million quarters but we think we can do better than we did in Q1.  Now I would also underpin this saying we are going to be very responsible in terms of how we go after that. We are very focused on profitability, making sure we got the right mix, we do have a huge upgrade opportunity as I mentioned before, and the other thought I would give you here is that this is really a foundation as we look at it for our LTE launch later this year. We\u2019re more excited than ever about the prospects and the capability of LTE so as we get more and more of our customers with smart phone based devices it\u2019s going to be a very nice transition into the LTE launch.  Now a couple of thoughts for you here on margin. We had a very good quarter from a margin perspective, 46%. As you know we don\u2019t have particular point guidance out there. We have seen particularly in these economic times a bit of a mixed shift towards the all you can eat plans, that\u2019s really driven more on the lower end of the marketplace. We\u2019ve seen some of our prepaid base move to the reseller plans. We\u2019ve seen some of the lower end of the market. That will probably continue for a little while but we still believe that we\u2019ll be a lot of strength on postpaid. Now just to refresh you on this, our reseller pricing is not unlimited, okay? It\u2019s really a bucket of minutes. Reseller customers that we're attracting now carry much higher ARPUs than our traditional ones, and are very profitable and are not dilutive to our overall margin. So we think we can continue to grow margin quite nicely in the wireless business and be in a very good position.\nOperator:   Our next question comes from Tim Horan - Oppenheimer. \nTim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer:  John, just a clarification on the postpaid ads, and then a strategic question. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how postpaid ads progress through the quarter? And I guess you're saying you're not really seeing shifts in market share, because I guess we're hearing Sprint and Team Mobile, Sprint particularly, is doing a little bit better with some of their new pricing moves. But just to clarify, you're not really seeing any shifts there?\nJohn F. Killian:  Tim, on that is our market share remains strong. We're still quite positive here. And I'd say we're pretty even in performance as we went through the quarter. We probably picked up a little bit towards the March timeframe. But again just to reiterate, we believe there still is postpaid growth out there for us. We believe our network and our offerings are a differentiator.\nTim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer:  And then just on the strategic front, there's been a lot of articles lately about Vodafone and their ownership of Verizon Wireless, and some speculation. On how to kind of simplify that, what do you think is the most likely outcome here? Is it maybe just status quo, find you guys the next couple of years?  And related to this, there were a few articles, I think some misunderstandings on the dividends. I got a lot of calls you might have to cut the dividend because the wire link can't support it. Do you see any issue importing cash up from the wireless unit up to the corporate unit? I mean I don't see what the concern is other than you have to pay some of that cash to Vodafone, but they're a shareholder like everyone else.\nJohn F. Killian:  Tim, it's a real surprise I'm getting this question by the way. So let me give you a couple of thoughts here. One is we've just passed the 10th year anniversary, hard to believe, of Verizon Wireless being created. And in partnership with Vodafone, I think our teams have done a great job. We've had a great working relationship with them over the last 10 years and the business is doing extremely well.  Now let me hit the dividend issue first because I think it's important. I want to make sure from our perspective that our shareholders understand that we view the dividend as being very safe. We're a business that generates a lot of cash flow, over $30 billion of cash flow. We have a lot of different levers we can pull to make sure we have the ability to pay the dividend.  And you know I'm surprised that becomes as big of a question as it does become given all of the levers and all of the cash flow that we have. We have numerous sources of cash that is being generated. And by the way paying the dividend to our shareholders, our shareholders are a priority for us. So the dividend and making sure we have stability and being in a position to recommend to the board dividend increases is highly, highly important to us.  Now on the strategic side of it Tim, you know, over the last 10 years you and I have both watched, there are kind of cycles where the whole ownership question gets more and more attention. We're in one of those times right now. From where I sit, the business is working extremely well. We've never made a secret of the fact that under the right conditions, right terms, of course we would be interested in buying out the minority interest for 45%. Why wouldn't we be in a business that's working as well as it is?  Now from my perspective as a CFO, that's very much a financial transaction. We run the business today, we operate the business, we manage it, we control it. So I would look at, you know, what is the price tag that the other party if they were interested in selling. What's the price tag? What's the multiple? Does it make sense to us from a financial perspective?  I don't know where that's going to go, but our view is pretty clear on that from that perspective. The discussions around merger that had been out there in the press, you know, I've made a comment on that recently and it kind of does reflect the belief of the management team. We're not convinced there's industrial logic behind putting the two organizations together.  By the way, not that we're not open to listening, hearing new information on that, but we do not see a significant level of synergies, cross border mergers, you know, have not been historically highly successful. A lot of management complexity comes with that. So while we're always interested to hear about that, we don't really see the industrial logic.  Now on the cash flow from wireless, the great news is there's a lot of cash flow. It's growing, it's getting better. It's going to continue to get better. We've been clear what our view is of that in the short-term, which is to use it to delever Verizon Wireless. That is still our view.  We have an annual discussion with Vodafone in December of each year. We'll have another next year. There is not [religion] though. I don't want you to think that we would never dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless. At some point when we're in a position where leverage is much lower than it is today, and when it is appropriate, we will dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless. It's just not a 2010 event. We'll be looking at that again as we get into 2011, but it's an event off into the future.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley:  A couple of FiOS questions. There's been a lot of talk about your FiOS, sort of build plans here. And I note that wireline Cap Ex was down about 22% year-over-year, although you reiterated your full year guidance. Perhaps you can just clarify your build year-to-date and your build plans for the rest of the year and what's going on there. And then on the FiOS ARPU up about 5%. What's driving that? Is that changes in the mix? Is that price increases? And where do you see that going over time?\nJohn F. Killian:  Obviously I said in the prepared remarks, we're very satisfied with where we are from a FiOS perspective. We're very focused on growing penetration. Our build plans, we're still on the path to build alternately to about 18 million premises within our franchise territories.  This year we're going to pass about 1 million premises in 2010. You know, give or take 100,000 or 200,000 on either side. Part of that is an intentional strategy, Simon, this year to focus down on a lot of the inventory we have. A very strong focus around the NPU population within our franchise territory.  We don't believe we've had enough focus there, and it's a great opportunity and a very cost effective way to drive new subscribers in new retention. Now from an RCM perspective you are right. We've had very good growth in FiOS RCM, more focused on the video side. We have had some price increases there which are natural, you know, in terms of the video side.  We've also seen improvements in some of our Video on Demand kind of services that are also contributing to that. So yes, we're very pleased with FiOS. The profitability continues to improve. We've been operating income positive the last couple of quarters. The cost metrics that we believed we would see ultimately with FiOS has positioned us very well.  And, you know, we think we've got a great foundation here on the wireline side for the future. That, you know, we will have somewhere in the range of post Frontier spinout 70% to 80%, in that range, of footprint covered with fiber. And that's going to position us very well for the future. You know, we've also got focus on making sure we've got capital discipline within the wireline business. We have suffered a little bit from the economy and some of the cyclical change. So there is focus on making sure we're investing at the right level in that business.\nSimon Flanner \u2013 Morgan Stanley:  So just to be clear, are you going to be finished with the FiOS build at the end of this year or might some of it now. If you're going to do 1 million a year instead of 2 million or 3 million, you're going to be a little bit more. Still in 11, 12 --\nJohn F. Killian:  We'll have a little more to do in the 2011, and maybe even the 2012. We're just stretching it out a little bit longer. We felt that was appropriate given where the economy was, given some of the attention we've got around the Frontier spinout. Don't read this at all to be at all we're not satisfied with FiOS. We are very satisfied with FiOS and will continue to evaluate that going forward.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Barden \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch\nDavid Barden \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: First would be a following up on the FiOS side, have you seen any change over the course of the quarter in the competitive dynamic in both DSL and FiOS relative to the incremental push the cable companies have been making on DOCSIS 3.0 especially on Comcast, how do you think competitively, looking into 2010 to \u201811, do you think you\u2019re stacking up now relative to cable in 2008 and \u201909?  The second question would be on the iPhone, not the question you think. It\u2019s clearer now, I think, than it\u2019s been that there\u2019s probably an iPhone refresh coming around the middle of the year. Obviously, last year\u2019s game plan was to wait, it came, you really got more aggressive on your smart phone portfolio than you\u2019d really ever been in the third quarter and that led to a market share swing back in your favor. Looking at it this year, what would be the game plan this year that you would do differently, if anything, to make sure that there isn\u2019t a market share swing in AT&T\u2019s favor the way we saw last year?\nJohn F. Killian: From a competitive environment, from cable on video and HSI, we really see no change. It is a very competitive environment, as you know and continues to be but I don\u2019t see anything in the quarter or this year that has really shifted. When you look at our results, we did better in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter.  Our total broadband was 89,000 just short of 100,000. That was up on [30] in fourth quarter a year ago. We continue to do reasonably well here. We\u2019d like to drive to a little bit higher numbers as we go through the next several quarters. We think with the economy starting to come back a little bit we\u2019re positioned for that. Our wireline team is very focused on it. We don\u2019t see\u2026and you know Dave, customer satisfaction and independent reports continue to put FiOS at the top of the list in all areas. We think we\u2019ve got a great product here. You\u2019re incenting people to change, right? They\u2019ve already got service, typically, so that\u2019s the trick for us.\nDROID, Android: There\u2019s no question, Apple\u2019s done a great job with the iPhone, but look at our results. We\u2019ve performed very well both from a growth, our revenue growth this quarter on the wireless side is better than it was last quarter, our service revenue is upticking . We have several different, new devices coming as the year goes on, most notably the one I just mentioned, which is the HTC Incredible. So, I think we\u2019ll be earlier in the process this year of having very strong devices to be very competitive. But again, based on multiple systems, we think we\u2019ll be in a very good position.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research: Thinking a little bit more about what you said on the wireline and cost cutting, I think I got the numbers right, you\u2019re saying $1.5 billion to $2 billion cost cutting goal. If you take the higher end of that on wireline revenue, I think it\u2019s a little over 400 basis points on the revenue. Is your goal to take the margin level from 21.7 and assume pension is unchanged from here just to take that out of the equation, are you thinking that the margin over a couple year periods will get back to a 26%? As you benchmark yourself around your competition, where do you have conviction as to where wireline margins should be for your company over time?\nJohn F. Killian: Mike, let me give you a couple thoughts here. You know we don\u2019t put out guidance numbers on that and point estimates. Let me just give you a little color to what we think happened in the quarter, where we\u2019ll focus on and where we think we\u2019re going.  If you look at the margin on the quarter at 21.7, we had to eat through a sequential revenue decline of about $225 million. By the way, we see good news there because rate of revenue decline in the quarter was only 2.9%, it was 3.9% in the fourth quarter, so we see improvement there.  We had a couple of unique issues in the quarter that hurt us a little bit. We had mentioned that this year that we do have some incremental pension and OpEx costs. That was about $40 million in the quarter. We had, and this is one we don\u2019t usually like to point to and talk to, but it was such a factor in this quarter that I\u2019m going to mention it, we did have extraordinary weather conditions on the east coast. That minimally cost us $50 million in the quarter. That was related to a lot of overtime because of the flooding conditions and record snowfall in the Mid-Atlantic States, which you usually don\u2019t have that caused complications. There are a lot of issues that contributed to the first quarter. Now when you look at our focus going forward, it\u2019s really focused around four items. It\u2019s continuing to focus on FiOS. We\u2019re very pleased with the profitability where FiOS is but we think it can get a lot better as we continue to get more and more scale. So that\u2019s going to continue to ramp up and help us. We think our enterprise and businesses services, as the economy gets better as we go through \u201910, probably saw a little sign of that in the first quarter. I don\u2019t think there was much of it in our numbers, but we think we\u2019ll see more of that particularly in the second half of the year. That will be very helpful to us.  Now, on the cost side, I hope you get the feel here that we are very focused on improving and continuing to improve the cost structure. I mentioned on previous calls the last couple of years we\u2019ve reduced our wireline workforce by about 13,000 per year and I said we would do the same this year. I actually think we have now the ability to do more than that this year.  You\u2019ll probably read in the press later today that we did reach agreement with our unions and our east coast unions, the CWA and the IBEW, on an enhanced incentive offer last night. That is going to allow us to take out a significant number of associates. One of our limitations on our ability to downsize the workforce was we were limited in our ability to layoff in our east coast contracts. We could layoff post 2003 hired employees and we did some of that last year, but beyond that it was voluntary incentives that drove it.  We reached agreement on an enhancement and I think this year we should be able to beat the 13,000 number. I\u2019m not going to put an exact number on that yet because we\u2019re still factoring through that based on the agreement. But I think we\u2019ll be very focused on additional force reductions this year. In addition to that, Mike, we\u2019re also very focused around cash flow in the wireline business. That ties back to some of the other questions and capital efficiency will improve. I\u2019m not going to put a number or a date on when this is going to turn, but I am convinced we have all of the right initiatives in place. We have the conviction to get it done and that we should see the ability to stabilize and then improve our wireline margins over time.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research: If I could just ask one follow up, when you typically lose revenue, you\u2019re typically able to take some costs out of that as well. Should we look at the cost cutting target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion as incremental to what you normally are able to take out with revenue? So, this extra turbo boost, if you would, to the reduction in cost or does that $1.5 billion to $2 billion incorporate what you expect to save as revenue erodes for whatever period of time you\u2019re forecasting?\nJohn F. Killian: Just a couple of thoughts here, Mike, I think with the news of last night, we might be able to do better than even the $2 billion. I\u2019m not going to give you a break out of how much is tied to\u2026What I think you\u2019re going to see is improving top line within the wireline business based on FiOS and the enterprise side. And you\u2019re going to see very visible cost reductions. Some of that is incremental to the normal but I\u2019m not going to place an exact number on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan\nMike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan: John, can you go into a little more detail about your comment about market share shift in wireless and you guys not seeing that, sort of the metrics that you\u2019re looking at there, certainly it seems like the [inaudible] marketplace is taking more and more share of growth after the market. If you\u2019re looking at purely churn then your base or just lost of gross [inaudible] overall and then secondly, in enterprise stuff it sounds like you\u2019ve got some good data plans coming from both AT&T as well you guys. Can you just give us a little more color on where you\u2019re seeing that, whether its demand for new orders, things coming through the pipeline and then sorry to bother you with the last one, in addition to the enterprise comment, how important is the enterprise recovery to your margin stability comment and why [inaudible] is it that, is it equally with cost reduction or is there one more important than the other? Thanks.\nJohn F. Killian: Okay hey Mike, you know on your first one on market share, we look at really every month we get studies from Nielsen on share shifts and all of that. Obviously we look at our churn numbers which are terrific, the postpaid churn at 1.07, we look at our porting ratio, so from our view we\u2019re hanging in there very nicely, and that\u2019s at a time where there is a little slowdown as you\u2019ve mentioned on the postpaid side so we feel good about where we are on wireless market share and we think we\u2019ll continue to do well as we go through the year.  From an enterprise perspective, a couple thoughts here for you, our number in the quarter only down, 1.4, had been down 4.8 in fourth quarter, 6.2 in third quarter. Even would you adjust for FX we were down 2.3 in the quarter versus 5.6 in the fourth, 5.3. So were definitely seeing improvement here from an enterprise perspective. We\u2019ve repeatedly said we\u2019ve been very successful in winning new opportunities in the marketplace. We continue to do that, a number of those are incremental. We\u2019re still seeing moves on both a private IP perspective as well as security services. We did see some benefits in the quarter also from CPE, now that\u2019s a good indicator I think of the economy, so that all puts us in a good position. Now on how important is it? It\u2019s important but relevantly there are four or five different major contributors that we need to get them all clicking. Cost is probably number one right now in terms of biggest contribution but continuing the progress on FiOS, continuing the progress on enterprise are all very important.  So I know you have another call at 9:30 so I think we\u2019re going to call this [inaudible] but I want to leave you with a couple of closing comments here. First of all let me thank you for joining us today. If you look at our wireless business we continue to see great opportunities to grow the business and to make the business more efficient. Our strategy around aggressive 4G deployment and increased smart phone penetration for multiple operating platforms will drive data growth and continue to differentiate us from our competitors.  We remain committed to maintaining reasonable growth and strong profitability in our wireless segment. On the wireline side, we believe that the strategy we put in place a few years ago, that is having a smaller footprint with the majority covered by FiOS, coupled with a more global enterprise business focused on multinationals is the right strategy that also differentiates us from our peers and will help drive growth for the long term.  I also recognize that the issue on the wire line segment is stabilizing and improving profitability. I do not want to overstate what we can do here in the short term but I believe our cost reduction initiatives will gain traction and with an improving economy we will see better wireline modules. Finally we continue to deliver strong cash flow metrics. Our dividend is strong and safe. We\u2019re maintaining good discipline in our capital spending and our balance sheet is solid.  Thanks again for joining us today on the call. \nRon Lataille : Thanks, John and Brad that concludes our call and thank everybody for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}], "2012": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2011, "date": "2012-01-24 12:01:17", "content": "Executives: John N.

Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported a loss of $0.71 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a noncash pension and benefits charge of $5.6 billion on a pretax basis. This mark-to-market adjustment related to our current year asset returns, discount rate and mortality assumption changes in our pension and postretirement plans. This adjustment is in accordance with the accounting policy we adopted a year ago, which requires us to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur and not smooth the effects over a longer period of time.  Adjusting for $1.23 per share of nonoperational items, fourth quarter EPS was $0.52, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS to $2.15. The comparable adjusted EPS in 2010 was $2.08.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone and happy new year. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few summary comments. We finished the year very strong, creating value for our shareholders in 2011 by generating a total return of 18.2% through a combination of stock price appreciation of 12.1% and our dividend payments. Our stock price appreciation outpaced our peers, as well as the S&P, Dow Jones and broader indices. For the fifth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and our improving earnings profile into 2012 and beyond. In 2011, we also made some smart investments for the future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continue to invest in networks and new technologies, which will be the platform for accelerated growth.  On the strategic front, we made some moves that will significantly improve our competitive position. These include the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch in the cloud computing space, several agreements to purchase additional spectrum, joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners including the cable companies and, of course, our continued leadership in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem.  We also renewed our focus on delivering solutions to customers and the markets we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business, wireless, FiOS, Strategic Services, the cloud, digital media and our global high-speed IP network. Our recently formed Global Enterprise solutions organization will strengthen our ability to provide fully integrated customer solutions.  In addition to making these investments in our future, 2011 was a great year of solid execution. We posted record revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjusted revenue growth of 6.2% for the full year, a significant acceleration from just below 2% growth in 2010. In addition to our strong revenue results, our sharp focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate a number of cost pressures, driving an increase to consolidated EBITDA of more than $950 million.  We also had a strong year in terms of cash generation with $13.5 billion in free cash flow. 2011 was an impressive year on a number of fronts, giving us tremendous confidence about our long-term growth prospects. Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter, starting with a few highlights.  As I just noted, we had a very strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Our 7.7% year-over-year growth was easily our highest quarterly growth of the year, and in fact, the highest quarterly growth since the formation of Verizon 11 years ago. In wireless, we had our best quarter ever in terms of smartphone sales, 4G LTE device sales and customer upgrades, along with the most retail gross adds in the 3 years. We lead the industry in retail postpaid connections and our 1.2 million postpaid net adds this quarter demonstrates that we continue to gain market share. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 195 markets covering more than 200 million POPs, with increasing customer awareness of its superior speeds, capabilities and new high-quality devices. 4G LTE is really taking hold. In addition to record device sales in the quarter, we are seeing a high-level activity at our innovation centers in Waltham and San Francisco. We currently offer about 20 4G LTE smartphone and data devices, and at CES, we announced 2 more mobile hotspots now called Jetpacks. Three smartphones: 2 for Motorola and one from LG and the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Clearly, the Verizon 4G LTE network is becoming the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a strong indicator for us looking forward. In Wireline, our revenue mix continues to improve, with FiOS representing 61% of our consumer revenue and enterprise Strategic Services making up 51% of our Global Enterprise revenue in the quarter. We effectively worked through the numerous challenges of the third quarter to restore Wireline segment profitability. Wireline EBITDA increased to $2.4 billion in the quarter, resulting in a 23.8% EBITDA margin, in line with where we ended the second quarter. Now that we are back on track, I am confident that we will see Wireline margin expansion in 2012. Again, a strong finish to a solid year, making us very confident about our growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond. Let's turn to Slide 5 next. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 7.7% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted annual growth of 6.2%, solidly within our 2011 guidance range of 4% to 8%. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were a net loss of $0.71 per share due to the significant noncash charge associated with our pension and postretirement plans. The largest component of this actuarial true-up, has to do with our discount rate assumption, which was 5.75% at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, this rate is adjusted to an estimate of the yields of high-quality long-term bonds, which was determined to be 5%.  Another part of this true-up relates to our return on pension assets. We assumed an 8% ROA at the beginning of the year and we came in at 5% for the year. There were also adjustments required based on mortality assumption changes. Excluding non-operational items, we earned $0.52 per share in the quarter, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS result to $2.15, up 3.4% from a comparable $2.08 per share in 2010.  Coming out of the third quarter, we indicated that we were on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth. Earlier this month, I indicated that a very strong December resulted in higher-than-expected wireless device sales, which sets up well for 2012 but resulted in us falling a little short of our full year EPS growth target by $0.02. I would also remind you that our $2.15 adjusted result included $0.05 of negative impact, primarily from the storms in the third quarter. So from my perspective, an adjusted EPS of $2.20 is a more logical starting point for you when considering our 2012 earnings growth potential. Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures for the full year totaled $16.2 billion, representing a decrease of 1.3% from 2010. In addition to being lower than the prior year, the $16.2 billion was favorable to our guidance of $16.5 billion.  Our capital efficiency has improved steadily and was below 15% for the year. With the heavy investment cycles necessary to transform our business largely behind us, we would expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low, to continue declining based on disciplined capital spending and improving revenue growth trends.  In Wireless, capital spending in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion, bringing the full year to $9 billion, an increase of 6.3%. The incremental spending in 2011 was a combination of 3G capacity requirements, driven by the Apple iPhone and the continued rapid expansion of our 4G LTE network.  In 2012, we will continue to migrate traffic from our 3G EV-DO network to 4G LTE, thereby freeing up 3G capacity and improving our capital and operating efficiencies.  In addition, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation and our target is to have 4G LTE coverage similar to our 3G coverage by mid-2013. In Wireline, capital spending was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $6.4 billion, a decline of more than $800 million or 12%. The decline in spending was driven by lower FiOS build-out cost, as well as efficiency gains from investing in newer technologies.  From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong financial position. Total debt was $55.2 billion and net debt was $41.8 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. As a reminder, the previously announced $10 billion Verizon Wireless cash distribution will occur next week.  Let's now move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter of growth, particularly with regard to retail customer activity. Total revenue grew to $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 7.8% year-over-year, which is a 90-basis point improvement in growth over the third quarter.  Total service revenue in the quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year, up from 6.1% growth in the third quarter. Within total service revenues, growth was impacted by year-over-year declines in roaming and wholesale revenue, which collectively amounted to roughly $140 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect to see less impact on year-over-year growth rates from these factors as we move through 2012. Total data revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19.2% year-over-year. Data now represents 41.6% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continued to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4 billion in the quarter, up more than 34% year-over-year. Messaging revenue, which makes up about 30% of total data, grew nearly 4% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.  Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8. We ended the year with industry-leading total connections of 108.7 million, up 6.3% from 2010. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market with 87.4 million connections, driven by demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. Retail net adds of 1.5 million in the quarter were the highest we've seen in 3 years. Within retail, 1.2 million were postpaid and 252,000 were prepaid. Within the postpaid net add mix, 1 million were smartphones and 400,000 were Internet data devices. The remaining being the net change in basic phones. Of particular interest, more than 700,000 of these net adds were 4G LTE smartphones or data devices. In retail prepaid, fourth quarter net add growth was equally distributed between tablets and phones. This quarter marks the first time in 2 years that prepaid phones, excluding tablets, had positive net adds. This is due to the success of our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer, which we put in place on a national basis in mid-September.  Postpaid device sales, which include both gross adds and upgrades, were significantly higher this quarter, driven by the Apple iPhone 4S, as well as the increasing popularity of our 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% sequentially and 7.6% year-over-year. The percentage of postpaid customers upgrading this quarter moved up to 10%. The continued demand for our wireless products is not only driving growth in connections and revenue, but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty metrics. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent once again, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, an improvement of 7 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2010.  Now let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at our smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. As I said, we had a record quarter in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 44%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 28%. We have made very good progress in 2011. 70% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones, a solid increase from 60% in each of the last 2 quarters.  During the quarter, we activated 4.3 million Apple iPhones and sold 1.6 million 4G LTE smartphones. In addition, we sold roughly 700,000 4G LTE Internet data devices. As I said, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum.  Shifting now to ARPU. Retail postpaid ARPU was $54.80 this quarter, up 2.5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid phone ARPU exceeds $56, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Postpaid Internet devices have an ARPU of just under $49, which was down 11% from a year ago. This decline was mainly due to a strategic price change we made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We made this pricing move to expand the market, given our expectation that the superior capabilities of 4G LTE will generate more demand and increase data usage on these devices. We did expand the market in 2011 with approximately 3.8 million unit sales, which included mobile hotspots, USB modems and tablets. We now have about 7 million subscribers with these devices, representing about 8% of our retail postpaid base. While the unit growth of these devices is diluting our overall retail postpaid ARPU at this time, fourth quarter revenue growth from these devices was 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to making a positive contribution to top line growth, the greater efficiency of our 4G LTE network means that this data revenue is also generating higher margins and driving improved profitability.  Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. 2011 was another strong year of industry leadership in terms of margin performance and cash generation. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone and numerous 4G LTE smartphones during the year, we indicated last January that margins would fluctuate in certain quarters depending on new device rollouts and sales.  Looking back on our quarterly margin performance in 2011, shows this to be the case, with strong sales in the first and fourth quarters pressuring EBITDA. As I mentioned, the sales volumes in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations but, obviously, will create more opportunity for growth in 2012. Our strong performance in terms of customer additions and market share gains, coupled with increased smartphone penetration, drove increases in retail service revenues and accelerating phone ARPU. In addition, our intense focus on cost efficiency is clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. Our industry-leading customer retention has also helped the margin and performance, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience.  Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader. And with another year of impressive overall performance, we've built great momentum heading into a new year, expecting to sustain our strong growth and profitability.  Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, a decline of $150 million or 1.5% year-over-year. With the full year Wireline revenue totaled $40.7 billion, down 1.3%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year, driven by FiOS revenue growth of 18.2%. In Global Enterprise, fourth quarter revenue also grew 1.3%, driven once again by Strategic Services, which increased 14.7% year-over-year. As I've said, Strategic Services, which include Terremark are growing portion of our revenue mix, representing 51% of total enterprise revenue in the fourth quarter. From a profitability perspective, the fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA margin recovered nicely from the challenges of the third quarter, increasing 240 basis points sequentially to 23.8%.  Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance, starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Fourth quarter revenue for mass markets increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consumer revenue, which represents a majority of this category, grew 1.3% in the quarter. Consumer ARPU steadily increased throughout the year and is now more than $96. I would also highlight that our residential connections trends continue to improve. We lost 183,000 retail residential connections in the fourth quarter, representing the 7.3% decline, compared with the loss of 303,000 or 9% in the fourth quarter of last year.  In broadband, we added 201,000 FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our subscriber base to 4.8 million and penetration to 36%. By adding in our 3.9 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.7 million broadband connections, adding a net positive 98,000 broadband connections in the fourth quarter.  In FiOS Video, we added 194,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.2 million and increasing our penetration to 32%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 3.5 million customers are triple play and FiOS ARPU increased in the fourth quarter to more than $148 per month. In terms of our deployment, we ended the year with 16.5 million premises passed, adding just over 900,000 in 2011. We had 13.6 million homes open for sale for Internet and 13.3 million for video. From my perspective, 2011 was a very good year for FiOS, both operationally and financially. For the full year, FiOS revenue grew 20% to $8.3 billion. Looking ahead, our focus will once again be to increase penetration, drive market and wallet share gains, realize more efficiency from a cost perspective and expand margins.  Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement in Global Enterprise revenue, led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP communications and our cloud offerings. In the fourth quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 14.7% year-over-year, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Services. Terremark revenues were up about 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter and roughly 18% year-over-year. Within our Global Enterprise solutions, we are focused on shifting our product mix to higher gross service offerings and we continue to gain traction here. In less strategic areas like core voice, data and hardware, we've continued to look for ways to improve overall margin profitability. One example is our deemphasis on sales of hardware or CPE, particularly drop-ship equipment that is not part of an overall enterprise solutions bundle.  During 2011, hardware sales were down roughly $340 million on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter alone, hardware revenue was down $147 million or 21.6% year-over-year. Looking at the services revenue component of Global Enterprises reveals a more positive growth trend. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Services revenue grew 2.7% year-over-year, excluding Terremark, which was not part of our results a year ago. If Terremark was included, the rate of growth would've been higher but would not represent a true baseline. In Global Wholesale, revenues in the fourth quarter declined 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to declines in voice, where we continued to experience secular pressures and lower volumes, offset in part by increases in certain data services. Our deemphasis of certain nonprofitable International Voice routes created downward pressure on revenue, but did contribute to improved wholesale margins.  Let's move to Slide 14 for our 2011 wrap up. We had a strong finish to a very solid year in 2011, giving us great momentum and confidence heading into the new year. Wireless, FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services all contributed to significant improvements and adjusted revenue growth, where we moved from just under 2% in 2010 to more than 6% in 2011. These revenue improvements and our focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate various cost pressures throughout the business, creating solid growth in earnings and strong free cash flow, supported by our disciplined approach to capital spending.  On the strategic front, we made a number of investments that have improved our competitive position and differentiated us in the marketplace, setting the stage for future growth and improved profitability. I believe investors recognized our progress in 2011, as our stock price appreciation and competitive dividend generated a total return to shareholders of 18.2%. We enter 2012 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, you will see a renewed focus on delivering solutions to all of our customers and the markets that we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business. Our Global Enterprise solutions organization is just one example, highlighting a more integrated approach in how we develop and deliver customer solutions, including a vertical industry focus into areas like education and healthcare as examples.  Another example is the way in which we are managing our top multinational accounts in collaboration with Vodafone where this makes sense for both companies. In terms of our acquisition of AWS spectrum from SpectrumCo, we are looking forward to closing the transaction after review by the Department of Justice and approval by the FCC, which we anticipate by midyear. We are also making progress in our additional agreements with the cable companies subject to the DOJ's expected review.  Just last week, Comcast and Verizon announced that we are offering each other's products and services in Seattle and Portland as our initial markets. We expect to launch in additional cities in the coming months. We have great momentum in Wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of smartphones and furthering our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capture pent-up demand in multidwelling units and new markets. And in the enterprise space, we are clearly gaining traction as the leading global provider in the information technology solution space. The integration of Terremark and the addition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position, giving us a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure.  Another key focus area will be to continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. With the formation of our operational excellence and process transformation organization, reporting directly to Lowell, we are devoting dedicated resources to examining all costs and processes including product rationalization, back office operations and system consolidation. The upshot of our ability to execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will be an increase in the cash flows of the business.  As I've said, the heavy investment cycles of the first 10 years of Verizon are largely behind us, and we have transformed ourselves into a company very well positioned in the growth markets of the future. We have the platforms, we have the people and we have the capabilities. We are poised to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we've achieved, further increase investment returns and create significant shareholder value in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: If we could just start with the -- or stay with the 2012 outlook. Last year, Fran, when you gave the 5% to 8% earnings growth, you also suggested that, that could double in 2012. Is that still the right range as we look forward here? And then turning to postpaid ARPU, you had a big quarter in terms of smartphones and Internet devices. Based on what you're seeing now, how do you expect those sort of growth trends on the postpaid ARPU side to progress, maybe in the first quarter and an outlook for 2012, if possible?\nFrancis J. Shammo: First of all, on the 2012 outlook, so let me start here. Actually, John and I are doing this call remotely from our Innovation Center up here in Waltham, which is just a pillar of how we're going to accelerate our growth in the future. As of many of you visited this facility, you saw the innovation of the products and the services, which I believe are pioneer in the industry of developing these types of solutions that will increase our revenue from a machine-to-machine perspective and everything that is going to be driven over our LTE network, which we believe we are a market leader in. So if you take the Wireless asset and then the FiOS asset and you look back at to what we said back in January of 2011, when Lowell and I first stood on this stage live, we stated that we had a year of execution in front of us and we ha certain targets that we wanted to hit. And I think that coming out of this year, I would say that my position has not changed from where I stood on that stage. So growth opportunities for the future, I believe, are there. As I said in my script remarks, I believe that the $2.15, as you look at it for 2012, should be a baseline of $2.20 as you project our growth out. But I would reiterate that my position from January has not changed as I sit here at the end of this year. Going on to postpaid ARPU growth, I think, if you look at this, we continue to grow our ARPU growth. I think that from an overall perspective, if you break that down, we had our phone ARPU grow to an all-time high of 4%. Now if you look back, that was 3.3% in the second quarter. That went up to 3.7% in the third and now sitting at 4% overall. So you can see that the smartphone penetration is accelerating that phone ARPU growth. As we've talked in the past, the Internet category has some dilution in it. So year-over-year, we're down 11% and this is reflected back when we changed our prices back in October perspective. So on an ARPU perspective of Internet devices, down 11%, but overall revenue growth from that category as we said, we did this to expand the category. And again, this quarter, we were up 24% year-over-year in the amount of Internet devices we added and we continue to have our strongest quarter of the year. So we are executing on the expansion of that category. So year-over-year, the actual revenue is up 10%, even though that there is some dilution in the ARPU side. So I think, John, to answer your question, I'm extremely positive and I stay with what I've said coming out of the third quarter. We continue to see that we can accrete our ARPU into the future of 2012.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe a couple of questions just related to Wireline margins. Fran, you talked about continued improvement into 2012, and I'm just wondering if you can help us with the baseline for that comment. Is that meant to be improvement off the 23.8% exit rate? Or is that a sort of general 2012 versus 2011 comment? And then related to that, can you just help us think through what the bigger drivers of improvement would be and if that includes any sort of benefit from the labor negotiations?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So the 23.8% coming out of the fourth quarter, what I would say is, we are very, very confident that through all of the things that we were doing on Wireline. First, start off with FiOS and our continued penetration there and we continue to gain market share in every market. New York continues to be our highest growing market there. So FiOS is a critical component to the growth of the Wireline on a top line basis. The other strategy that we've talked about a little bit in the past is the strategy of migrating our copper plant over to the FiOS plant, now that we have substantial FiOS passing prems, where there is also copper. So what you're going to going to see this year is a very strategic initiative that we go out and we look at areas, where there are chronic copper problems and we start to transform them onto our FiOS network. And the math would say, if there is a chronic problem that we have to visit more than 2x a year, the actual financial benefit of us transforming that to FiOS pays for itself within that year. So we will strategically start to go in there. What that brings is, that brings an enormous expense savings to us from just an overall operational plant perspective. That's one big component. The second is, obviously, with the new organization of Enterprise, we believe that with the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch, we continue to grow that top line. As I said, Terremark had an outstanding quarter, sequentially up 10%. That came out of a September all-time high booking. That will continue into '12 because, obviously, those bookings don't book all in the same quarter that you sell. In this business, it takes 6 to 12 months to record that revenue. So I think we're continuing to expand on our cloud services bases, which also helps top line revenue for Wireline. And then you get into the cost initiatives, which continue to really be a focus of the whole business unit. So from a foundational standpoint, what I would say is this, on a linear basis, you will see us increase Wireline margin. Will we have some setbacks here and there? Obviously, in the first quarter, we have a lot of tax resets and so forth. So from that perspective, you may see us decline a little bit in the first quarter. But from that point, we will accelerate and continue to overall improve the Wireline margin of the business. Now on the improvement side, I would tell you that we continue, from a labor negotiation standpoint, we continue to negotiate at the table. Obviously, as I said before, we expect that we need to reconfigure the cost structure of our Wireline business. And that gets to the heart of the healthcare and the pension benefits of the Wireline representative and employees. So our position has not changed, we will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. And we'll report out when those negotiations are ended and where we end for that contractual period.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Fran, that's helpful. If I could just ask for one clarification just on the prior sort of EPS commentary. You said nothing's changed from your January position. I'm just -- the clarification, I guess, would be the interpretation around the January position because the math of it would tell you, 5% to 8% growth and then double that, so 10% to 16% growth. But then the separate interpretation was double the rate of 2011 growth. So are you saying you're comfortable in doubling the rate of 2011 or you're comfortable with the original 10% to 16%?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes. It's more of, I'm comfortable with where we said we would be in January of '11. So my position has not changed.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Very strong results, obviously, from the iPhone, we've seen it across the industry. You talked about a very strong December. How should we think about Q1 versus Q4? Is this a product that's going to continue to have legs into the first quarter of the year? Or do you think the first quarter is going to be a more normal quarter as we'd had in, say, the first 9 months of the year. I'm including this sort of original iPhone launch? So any trends, I know it's early in the year, but anything -- how we should be thinking about Wireless margins in Q1? And then staying on wireless, you noted that there was some pressure on other service revenues from wholesale, roaming, I think that you lost your Telematics customer. Can you just give us a little bit more color about -- around that and what's going to sort of make that better in 2012?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So from a Wireless margin perspective, here, look, I think I'd look at it this way. You talked about one product, I talk about a whole portfolio of products. So if you look at our LTE lineup and just to give you some numbers. We sold almost 15 million Android-based products, and if you do the math for the quarter, it's about 10.8 million iPhone products. So they're both extremely significant to our portfolio. If you look at LTE, we're coming out of the year with almost 18 devices on our network and we will add 6 more in the first quarter of this year, leading us to 24. So I think that the way we look at it is, our momentum coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter and, obviously, the first quarter will be more of what we saw in the first 3 quarters because, obviously, the fourth quarter is always a much higher volume quarter just because of seasonality. So I would think that, Simon, on this one, what I would say is this: is we have a proven track record in Wireless that we both drive profitability and growth. And I would expect that in 2012, we will get back to and continue to improve on the Wireless margins. So if you look at what we did in the third quarter, going back, we had an iPhone in our portfolio. We had 3 quarters under our belt with a very real large lineup of 4G LTE devices, and we produced the highest margin in Wireless in the history of the Wireless business at 47.8% margins. So, I guess, what I would say to you is, is that we will strive to continue to improve on the Wireless margins, not only on the top line growth perspective, but we also in the last 2 years trimmed out almost $3 billion of cost in our Wireless business. So again, I think the focus will be to improve and continue to grow, as well improve on the profitability of the Wireless margins. On the wholesale side, there are 2 things happening. Obviously, I reported out that the third quarter, that with the sale of the Alltel properties, we knew that AT&T would be moving that traffic off of our network, which they did. And then in the reseller base, I think it's very important to note that the resellers that we have contracts with are mainly prepaid resellers. And as I've said in the past, as this has declined in the last couple of quarters, we have an issue with us which is, I will only enter into agreements that are win-win for both. And right now, the market is at a point, where I'm not going to compete on the wholesale rates that are in the marketplace. Although this is an extremely important channel for us and we continue to work with our highest resellers, we do have a shift mix in the reseller base. So we added 371,000 net reseller adds, but some of this is a mix change going into lower, what I would call, live source-type offerings and more universal service fund-type offerings, so they carry a lower ARPU than some of our historical prepaid voice resellers would. But overall, the profitability of this is still very substantial. But I also think it's important to note that as we attack the prepaid market, we performed and launched our Unleashed product which, coming out of the third quarter I said, and was very optimistic, that this would be the first quarter that we showed positive net adds in that product space and we actually did. So from a net perspective, we had net adds in prepaid for the first time in, at least in the past 2 years. So we are starting to gain momentum in the prepaid market, both through the reseller channel but also through our unleashed channel. So I think that's what you can continue to see. So that's for the wholesale roaming side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Maybe let's talk about CapEx to start. You talk about better efficiency in the slide deck. So with the revenue rising, should we think about that as being sort of flat? And then also on the cash outlay side, can you talk about cash taxes in 2012? Do you expect that to be sort of in line with the GAAP taxes or maybe a little higher as bonus depreciation starts to slip away?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So from a CapEx perspective, coming out of the first half of this year, I stated that we would have very strong management of our capital expense as we continued to build out the EV-DO network and the capacity required to carry the iPhone on the 3G network from a capacity standpoint. And I think you've seen that Verizon Wireless has managed this extremely efficiently by moving higher end Internet devices off of the 3G network onto our 4G network. And just one other note is, in the fourth quarter, all of our Internet devices sold, 100% of those adds, were all on the 4G LTE network. So I think from a CapEx standpoint, what I would say is, I would not expect any change here from a disciplined capital spending coming out of the back end of 2011 going into '12. And as I said, we will continue to improve our overall CapEx-to-revenue ratio. So I wouldn't expect you to see anything differently than what we've executed on through 2011. As far as cash outlay, from a cash tax perspective, as you know, the bonus depreciation is Safe Harbor for 2012. So there really is no additional cash tax from the bonus depreciation and, obviously, there's still a lot of things that we're looking at for 2012 from a bonus depreciation discussion down in Washington, of an extension of that, possible overall corporate tax restructure. So we look at those things. But I will tell you, that even without that, we continue on a very complex organization of taxes for federal purposes, continue to strategize and continue to think of how we best utilize our structure to make sure that we have as minimal cash outlay as possible from a cash tax perspective. The only thing I will highlight from a cash differentiation for 2012 is the pension plan contribution, as I talked about. This will go from $400 million up to $1.26 million for '12, and those contributions will be made more or less smoothly through the year, but the first and the third quarter will be around $400 million and then evenly in the second and fourth quarters. So that really is the only change from what I would expect from a cash outlay. The only other thing I would say is, as our profits continue to increase and we grow bottom line, obviously, our cash taxes will increase with them.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Timothy Horan of Oppenheimer.\nTimothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I'm just trying to understand, Fran, your comments on LTE. Maybe what you're thinking on market share and on the pricing for LTE. It's clearly expanded the market, but maybe when do you think you'll have the ability to go out and raise prices for LTE. And I'm not sure if you gave the numbers, but what percentage of LTE subscribers are new to Verizon and maybe how does that compare with the iPhone? And lastly, it just seems like LTE is just a huge advantage this year. Do consumers really understand it? Is the advantage really going to be pressed with all the new devices that you have coming out? And just how you're thinking about LTE versus your competition for this year, which it seems, it was the year you'd be able to capture a lot of the high-end subscribers off your peers?\nFrancis J. Shammo: I think that just from an overall market perspective, obviously, we believe that we are, without a doubt, the market leader in this innovation pioneering of the technology of LTE. We have now over 200 million POPs covered, which exceeded what our original plans were to achieve 185 million POPs. And as I said, we initially told that we would have 3G and 4G coverage about the same by the end of 2013, and we have now said by mid-2013, we'll have that coverage fulfilled. So, I think, from just an overall leadership position and a market position, I think we're in great shape. From a pricing perspective, obviously, we did the fourth quarter promotion, where we said we doubled your allowance coming, so that we would have more enticement of people looking at the 4G product. And as you can see, we had our all-time high of 4G devices moved, of over 2.4 million devices in the quarter moved, from that strategy. So I think overall pricing what I would say is this, I think you'll see more movement on device pricing than you will on overall service pricing. We'll have to see what the competitive marketplace holds for this. But I think that from just an overall perspective, LTE will be a market leadership for us. And it's not only around just the retail market, but we can't lose sight of the machine-to-machine market. And obviously, I said, I was sitting up here in the innovation lab, there is a lot of technology and innovation that's going to come out around an automobile, around healthcare, around energy conservation that really will leap bound anything that we see currently in the marketplace today. So I think that from a machine-to-machine perspective, we continue to see growth in our adds quarter-over-quarter, and I see that continuing through 2012 and have a market leadership position there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: First, could we just get an update on Verizon Wireless debt and cash at the end of the quarter? And then secondly, could we just get a deeper dive on what's happening in the improvement in Global Enterprise revenue? What are the products that you find are really helping the Strategic Service revenue growth? And then, are you also seeing less headwinds on -- those downward pressures on the legacy side of Enterprise?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So from a Verizon Wireless perspective, they're going to end the year at $12.3 billion worth of cash on the balance sheet. They have $11.6 billion of debt, so they're actually in a surplus position of $700 million. For 2012, they have about $1.6 billion of maturities coming that will be paid down. And as I said, within the next week, we will have a $10 billion distribution to both of the parents there. So that's the situation of the cash and the debt on the Wireless side. From an enterprise perspective, I think that it's critical here, just overall, with this organizational structure that Lowell has set up with the Enterprise Solutions Group. It is key for us because, I said before, as we approached our enterprise customers, we still had a delineation between a wireless solution and a wireline solution. And now that the organizations come together with the product rationalization that I talked about, it's going to be critical for us to present one solution to our customer end-to-end. And that really, I think, will elevate where we are today just from an overall strategic services position. But to get to your question, Mike, about exactly what are we selling. Obviously, cloud services, the acquisition of Terremark, the addition of CloudSwitch, the opening of the NAP center in Amsterdam, the expansion of our S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil data center which quite honestly, up to the acquisition of Terremark, Verizon really never played or had a position in Latin America, so this is a very high growth area for us. So I think, one, absolutely around the cloud, but also the convergence of cloud and what that brings to -- from an overall enterprise mobility standpoint and the integration of that cloud and that mobility solution when you look at machine-to-machine and cloud and what that can bring to an enterprise customer in a vertical solution set. So I think you're going to see more and more around cloud, but machine-to-machine. And then obviously, around our IT and advanced communication offerings. But there also is a differentiation as to what we sell here in North America versus what we sell outside of North America. And as I said before, outside on international, again, this quarter we grew our international enterprise base by an excess of 9%. So even with all of the pressures you see around the world, we continue to grow. Now, obviously, that's because of our low market share in those markets, but continued growth for us. And as we expand internationally, I think you'll see more international growth out of us, especially around the cloud services. And as I said, the collaboration of Vodafone where it makes sense. So I think there's a couple of different facets there, but I am very -- I have a very good outlook for our Enterprise revenue growth going into '12, even with the continued stabilization of the economy and we have not forecasted much growth there but stabilization would be a key. And if there is growth there, then I think we are even more optimistic on our Enterprise growth.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.\nJennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered but just on FiOS, nice growth there. I know you said it's going to be a large part of the revenue contribution in Wireline next year, or this year rather. Can you just comment on the pricing you're seeing there and the competitive environment specifically with the cable players?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes. I think this is extremely important because as I've said before, I know folks are saying that we're overly competitive in pricing. But what I would say is, that the pricing has not actually changed and if anything, if you look at it, there was a price increase in 2011. And there will probably be some more price increases in 2012 as we go here. But I think the differentiation we have here is, we have a superior product in FiOS. It is taking hold in the marketplace. We are seeing, as I said, New York is our highest growing market. This past year, we crossed a milestone in Virginia. We passed 40% penetration on our video services. You can see we had a good quarter on broadband connection in FiOS. And I think if you look at the line loss that we set at 7.2%, you can see that, that strategy of the chronic, we started that in the fourth quarter of this year a little bit. You can see that we are starting to convert copper voice customers onto FiOS. So continuing to grow and hold on to that declining revenue stream of the legacy products. So I think, overall, FiOS will continue to play a very important strategic role in the future of Wireline. We will compete vigorously with this, even with the agreements that we entered into with the cable companies. If you look at the innovation agreement, that innovation will come into FiOS. And being a superior product already, that innovation will add what we can bring to the consumer base from an overall perspective. So I think, overall, I'm very optimistic on our FiOS penetration for 2012.\nOperator: Your last question will come from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDavid W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two, if I could. Just first, Fran, going back to the Wireless pricing equation. You guys have had, I think, a comfort level with your products' status relative to others, pricing it at a premium. We saw a price hike a year ago from Sprint. We saw an overall kind of refresh of pricing from AT&T recently. You have talked about the introduction of new family plan prices. If you could kind of elaborate a little bit on how the pricing lever can be used to kind of grow ARPU in 2012, that would be helpful. And then second, the Wireline revenue side would probably have grown in aggregate, if it weren't really for the kind of other segment, which kind of fell off in 4Q. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on, on what's going on there and what the outlook for that is in '12?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So, David, just to follow up, you're talking on the wholesale side of Wireline?\nDavid W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Sorry, on the -- there's consumer, small business equals mass markets, then Strategic Services and other, which was 1.94 down from 1.99 in 3Q.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Okay. All right. Very good. Thanks. So from an overall Wireless pricing equation, I think that we are the market leader. We set our tier pricing structure when we launched our 4G network. And as I've said, the way we positioned our 4G tier pricing was that based on our future view of where usage would go, we saw that we had opportunity from a tiered structure and the proliferation of video through the LTE network that we would grow our revenue streams. And that's what we're seeing just from an overall tiered pricing structure. As we continue to mature this, we have said that we are looking at family data plans, if you will, and we continue to look at that. And obviously, the play there is, is to make sure that it's a win-win for the customer and a win-win for us from an accretion standpoint. So we continue to work that. But I think that it's important to note that we are a premium-priced product, but we will win in the marketplace just like we did with Unleashed even though that, that's priced $10 above the market. We now see that there are niches of people that want to be on the best network in the world. So I think that will continue to be our strategy, and we'll see here as 2012 goes. As far as Wireline goes on that, I think wholesale, we continue to see pressure on the wholesale side of the business just from a legacy voice. And as we transform this business from a legacy voice business to a data business, continue with our fiber to the cell program, which we are building out for various wireless carriers. This continues to be very good business for us, but not quite enough to offset the voice loss. So I think we'll continue to see pressure in there going into 2012. As far as the other category, this is legacy MCI 108 traffic, call collect-type traffic, which will continue to decline. It's not something that's strategic for us and we'll just really move that as a cash cow at this point, and that will continue to decline. So overall, the focus here is on the consumer Wireline margin, the Enterprise portfolio and then also the wholesale portfolio.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.  This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.  For the third quarter of 2011, we reported earnings of $0.49 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $201 million or $0.07 per share for non-operational charge for pension-related items, primarily comprised of actuarial remeasurement losses related to employees who received lump sum distributions in connection with previously announced separation plans. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.56, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.63. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief comments. We had another quarter of solid execution and earnings performance. Adjusted earnings were higher than the same quarter last year and would have been higher sequentially were it not for some extraordinary and, hopefully, nonrecurring challenges this quarter. In spite of this additional pressure from the storms and the strike, which had about a $0.05 impact on EPS in the quarter, we remain on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share off a base of $2.08 in 2010. In terms of cash generation, we had a strong quarter with disciplined capital spending, resulting in a solid increase in free cash flow. I'd also highlight that our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% dividend increase in September, which on an annual basis is an increase from $1.95 to $2 per share. This marked the fifth consecutive year of dividend increases, a testament to our board's confidence in the sustainability of our cash flows. We are very pleased with our progress in the key strategic areas which are the platforms for sustainable growth. In Wireless, we continue to perform extremely well, and we are further enhancing our leadership in 4G LTE. In addition to making great progress and extending our network capabilities to more markets, we are seeing increasing customer demand for smartphones, tablets and Internet devices that take advantage of the superior speeds of our LTE network. In FiOS, we continued to steadily increase penetration on all our markets. By further penetrating existing markets, we will enhance our capital and operating efficiency and improve overall investment returns. In the Enterprise space, we are getting some traction in spite of the macroeconomic challenges. We are having productive dialogue with many large customers and secured new agreements for Strategic Services during the quarter with RWE of Germany, Smile Brands and the University of North Carolina, to name a few.  Our competitive position in the cloud space has been bolstered by the acquisition of Terremark earlier this year and, more recently, with the addition of CloudSwitch, a well-known Software-as-a-Service provider. A number of multinational companies, including ORINK, adopted our cloud services during the quarter. Some segment-specific highlights are on Slide 4. In Wireless, we had another excellent quarter with strong growth in retail customers, revenue and ARPU accretion. Our performance with respect to margin, churn and free cash flow was extremely strong in the third quarter. In fact, our Wireless service EBITDA margin of 47.8% is the highest we have ever reported since the formation of Verizon Wireless in the year 2000. In Wireline, an unprecedented series of storms caused power outages and severe flooding in nearly every part of our landline footprint, causing a significant increase in repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the 2-week strike in August delayed new FiOS installations and, together with the storms, created a sharp increase in our FiOS sales order backlog. The storms also created delays in some order provisioning with Enterprise customers. The impact of these factors caused a 250 basis point decline in the Wireline EBITDA margin this quarter.  In spite of these challenges, we did increase penetration in both FiOS Internet and TV. In addition, we continued to improve our overall Wireline revenue mix with FiOS representing nearly 60% of consumer revenue and Strategic Services nearly 50% of Enterprise revenue. All things considered, we had a solid performance under some tough circumstances.  Let's now move to our more detailed review of the quarter, starting with Slide 5. Our top line growth trends continue to be very positive with solid growth in all strategic areas: Wireless, FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services. Consolidated revenue in the third quarter increased to $27.9 billion or 5.4% year-over-year. Through 9 months, adjusted revenue growth was 5.6%. Consolidated EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $9.2 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year. Obviously, this growth was adversely affected by Wireline this quarter. Earnings for the quarter were $0.49 per share with $0.07 of non-operational charges related to pensions and benefits. So our $0.56 adjusted result compares favorably with our first 2 quarters of this year, especially when you consider that it includes about $0.05 of storm and strike impact. Through 9 months, our $1.63 per share represents a 5.8% increase in adjusted EPS on a comparable basis with last year. Again, our year-to-date performance confirms the strength of the business and the path that we are on to create long-term shareholder value.  Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow this quarter increased by $1.9 billion or 59% sequentially, driven by a double-digit increase in cash from operations and reduced levels of capital spending. So far, we've invested $12.5 billion in capital through 9 months, and we are on track to meet our full year guidance of $16.5 billion, which is equal to the amount we spent last year. Our CapEx-to-revenue ratio in the third quarter was 13%, a 350 basis point improvement sequentially and 260 basis points better year-over-year. In Wireless, capital spending in the third quarter totaled $1.8 billion, which was significantly less than the $2.7 billion spend in each of the first 2 quarters of this year. As we said, second half spending will be lower than the first half, particularly with regard to 3G capacity.  Our 4G LTE deployment is going very well, and we are now providing service in 165 markets, covering more than 186 million PoPs. With additional markets planned in November and December, we are actually ahead of schedule and have already exceeded our year-end target of 185 million PoPs.  In Wireline, capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled $1.6 billion. Year-to-date, Wireline capital spending of $4.8 billion was 6.5% lower than last year. We've generated $9 billion in free cash flow for the first 9 months. And our outlook for the balance of the year remains very strong, especially in light of the lower capital requirements. The sustainability of this cash flow underpins our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. You will recall that in late July, the Verizon Wireless Board of Representatives declared a distribution of $10 billion to its owners, payable on January 31, 2012. In addition, as I highlighted earlier, our board recently approved a dividend increase for the fifth consecutive year. Our financial position is strong from a balance sheet perspective. Net debt at the end of September was $44.6 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is about 1.3x.  Let's now move into our review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter with solid growth in postpaid connections, the highest retail service revenue growth we've seen since the second quarter of 2009 and faster growth in retail postpaid ARPU. In addition, our industry-leading EBITDA service margin improved to a record high 47.8%. Total revenue grew to $17.7 billion in the quarter, up 9.1% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 6.9% year-over-year, 140 basis points higher than the 5.5% growth we reported in the second quarter. Postpaid service revenue, which represents 98% of retail service, grew 7.2% year-over-year. Total service revenue grew 6.1% year-over-year. This rate of growth was impacted by a $61 million year-over-year decline in other service, which is primarily roaming and wholesale revenue. Total data revenue grew to $6.1 billion in the quarter, up 20.5% year-over-year. Data now represents 40.6% of our total service revenue. Growth continued to be driven by web and e-mail services, which increased to $3.7 billion this quarter, up more than 36% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up just under 1/3 of data revenue, grew at just over 5% on a year-over-year basis.  Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 8. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market and lead in 4G LTE. Retail customer growth continues to be driven by steady demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices and, of course, on the reliability of our premier network. During the third quarter, we added over 1.3 million total connections: 882,000 were retail postpaid net adds, 86,000 were retail prepaid and roughly 367,000 were wholesale and other connections. Importantly, 52% of the retail postpaid net adds in the quarter were 4G LTE smartphones and Internet devices, up from 30% in the second quarter. Our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer was only available nationwide since September 15, which was not long enough to affect the quarter. We are optimistic that this will help our retail prepaid performance in the fourth quarter.  Total devices, both gross adds and upgrades, while relatively strong, were down about 5% sequentially this quarter, due primarily to customer anticipation of the next version of the Apple iPhone. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled $3.3 million, up about 3% year-over-year but lower sequentially. The percentage of customers upgrading was also lower than the prior 2 quarters. The continued demand for our Wireless products is not only driving growth in connections and revenue but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty. Our churn metrics this quarter were once again excellent with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, a 13 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year.  Next, let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU. We continue to make progress in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the smartphone penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 39% from 36% last quarter. A year ago, that penetration was 24%. We sold 5.6 million smartphones in the quarter, representing 60% of all postpaid phone sales compared with 43% a year ago. More than half of the total smartphones sold this quarter were Android phones, either 3G or 4G. Another 35% or 2 million were iPhones, bringing our year-to-date total to 6.5 million. We anticipate that the strong demand we're seeing for the new iPhone 4S will bring even more new customers to the nation's most reliable wireless network. We sold a total of 1.4 million 4G LTE devices in the quarter. Just over 1/2 of these were smartphones, and the rest were Internet data devices. Shifting now to ARPU, retail postpaid ARPU was $54.89, up 2.4% year-over-year, which is a 50 basis point improvement in growth from last quarter. Keep in mind that, that is a blended metric. Retail postpaid phone ARPU is about $56 and grew 3.7% year-over-year, showing good accretion from 3.2% growth last quarter. Internet data devices have an ARPU of about $49. While the growth of these devices is deluding our postpaid ARPU growth at this time, expanding this category remains a key strategic focus for us. We continue to see strong demand for our 4G LTE mobile hotspot devices and PC cards as well as tablets. This category of devices represents nearly 8% of all our retail postpaid subscriber base. I would also note that these data-only devices typically carry a much lower subsidy than phones, so they have a very short payback period and contribute to profitability fairly quickly. In addition, the migration of data traffic from our 3G to our 4G network will enhance our capital and operating efficiency and will help us drive improved returns going forward. Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the third quarter, we generated $7.2 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 7.5% year-over-year and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 240 basis points sequentially to 47.8%. This is an extraordinarily strong result. Our margin improvement goes beyond the fact that device sales were lower this quarter. Higher retail service revenue and our intense focus on cost efficiency are clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. In addition, we continue to lead the industry in customer loyalty, which we believe is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. We continue to execute very well on our strategy of increasing growth and profitability. Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. As I said earlier, the third quarter posed challenges to the Wireline business, and as a result, some of our key financial performance metrics were adversely affected. Setting aside these impacts, total Wireline revenue in the quarter remained steady. Consumer revenue grew 1.1% year-over-year with FiOS revenue up 18.5%. In Global Enterprise, revenue growth was 2.1% year-over-year, driven by Strategic Services growth of 15.6%. Strategic Services are becoming a much larger portion of our revenue mix, now representing nearly 50% of total Enterprise. From a profitability perspective, segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $160 million or 6.9% year-over-year. We've estimated that the storms and the strike cost us $250 million in the quarter, causing the Wireline EBITDA margin to decline sequentially to 21.4%.  Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance, starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Consumer revenues were $3.4 billion, up 1.1% versus last year. Consumer ARPU continued to increase and is now over $94. Residential access line loss this quarter was 8% compared with 9.6% a year ago. FiOS now represents nearly 60% of consumer revenue. The increasing scale of the FiOS platform is significant enough to more than offset the secular and competitive pressures in the consumer landline business. The storms and the strike caused customer growth in FiOS to be lower than prior quarters. In FiOS TV, we added 131,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4 million and increasing our penetration to 31%. On the broadband side, we added 138,000 new FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our FiOS Internet customer base to 4.6 million, representing 35% penetration of homes open for sale. By adding in our 4 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.6 million broadband connections adding a net positive 20,000 broadband connections this quarter.  While we always have a healthy FiOS pipeline, our installation backlog spiked to roughly 1.8x at its peak in early September. We ended the quarter at about 1.2x our typical pipeline and have been actively working through these orders in October. In the fourth quarter, we expect to add more than 200,000 FiOS Internet and TV subscribers.  Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 13. In Global Enterprise, increases in Strategic Services continued to drive year-over-year revenue improvement, led by a very strong growth in advanced services such as Managed Network, Call Center, IP Communications and our cloud offerings. The inclusion of Terremark added about $100 million to revenue this quarter. As a result of our improving sales mix, the absolute dollar growth in Strategic Services once again outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Service.  International revenue, which makes up approximately 15% of Global Enterprise, grew 9.8% year-over-year. In Global Wholesale, while revenues declined 9% year-over-year, the rate of decline is moderating on a sequential basis. As we've discussed, our route rationalization strategy resulted in a substantial decline in International Voice revenue, which has impacted year-over-year comparisons. We made these price changes in 2010 and have one more quarter to work through before the comparative impact of these actions moderates. In the third quarter, this accounted for a revenue decline of about $90 million year-over-year. Absent these effects, second quarter Global Wholesale revenues declined 5.8% year-over-year. This decline is primarily in Domestic Voice, where we continue to experience secular pressures and lower usage volumes.  I will wrap up now on Slide 14. Back in January when we talked about our 2011 priorities, I said this year would be all about execution. Now that we are 3 quarters through the year, our results demonstrate solid execution on our strategy. We are on track to meet our guidance for revenue and earnings growth as well as capital spending in spite of the challenges that impacted us in the third quarter. We have great momentum in Wireless, and we expect to build on that strength. We are geared up for an exciting fourth quarter with a host of new smartphones, tablets and data devices coming to the market. Earlier this week, we announced the DROID RAZR by Motorola, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone. In FiOS, we expect to get back on track quickly, driving higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capturing pent-up demand in new markets. In the Enterprise space, we are also gaining momentum as a leading global provider in the information technology solutions space. The integration of Terremark and the recent acquisition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position. We now have a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure that allowed Terremark to achieve a record new sales bookings in the third quarter. More and more, CIOs are recognizing the value of our Enterprise solutions, which is helping us to effectively manage through some pockets of economic pressure in the small and midsized business markets.  Our financial objective is to continue to increase free cash flow through improved operating performance, disciplined capital spending and the efficient use of working capital. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have very competitive dividend.  With that, I will turn it back to John so we can get to your questions.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Fran, a couple of questions. First on Wireless, if we look at retail service growth, I think, as you mentioned, up 6.9%, that's a big step up sequentially. But when we look at the total service growth line, up 6.1%, I think that's been weighed down a bit as you mentioned by roaming. Can you just help us think through that and what some of that pressure -- or when some of that pressure might abate? And then second question, just on Wireline margins, sort of excluding the storm and the strike costs, were up 10 basis points sequentially. That's the fourth straight quarter we've seen sequential improvement. As we look forward, can margins expand further from here? What's the outlook?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Jason, so first, let's talk about the Wireless segment on the service revenue. So overall, 6.1%, that was down from 6.6% in the second quarter. Before I get to that explanation, just a couple of things to highlight here. As you mentioned, the retail service revenue from 5.6% to 6.9% and then retail postpaid from 6.2% to 7.2%. And as you recall back in the second quarter, I reiterated that we were on a glide path to accelerate our ARPU growth and our revenue growth into the third quarter, and I continue to see that ramp going into the fourth quarter. Now as far as service revenue goes, we did have a $61 million decline in wholesale and other, and the majority of this was all related to the Alltel properties and that traffic moving off of our network. So as far as going forward, that traffic's gone. But just keep in mind that, that revenue stream is less than 4% of our total revenue, so it really has no impact on the bottom line per se. And that's why we're focused in on the entire postpaid base area. Now as far as Wireline goes, what I would say is that when you consider the storms and all that and then from a perspective of the backlog that we have both on the FiOS side and also the Enterprise side, this leads into what will continue into the fourth quarter. And I think we've been very clear that both Lowell and I\u2019s objective is to improve the overall profitability and cash flow of the Wireline unit. And what I would say is, is that we will increase the margin in the fourth quarter. I think there will be some echo effect here from the backlog on a top line basis in booking that revenue. Now having said that, Terremark did have an outstanding September, and that revenue will flow in the fourth quarter. So at this point, I think it's too early to tell exactly where we'll end up. We started to recover from the storms on the installations side in the last 3 weeks of the third quarter. FiOS adds actually came in better than we thought. Originally, we thought we would be about a 50% run rate. We came in higher than that. So we're starting to eat into that backlog, and it's a fact of how quickly we can get there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess maybe a follow-up to Jason's last question there. Could you give us more detail on the FiOS sense of storm-related costs and maybe break that out a bit? And I guess similar to his question, I guess you're suggesting that we're going to see some our expenses in 4Q given the backlog. I'm just trying to get a sense of if the margins in 4Q snap back to 2Q levels or what the depth will be. And then I guess while we're still talking about margins, you benefited from somewhat fewer upgrades, fewer smartphone sales. As we look in the margin on the Wireless side on the 4Q, should we expect that to reverse given the sort of people waiting for the iPhone and then the typical seasonality we see in 4Q? If you could just give us a sense of how you expect that to fall in the fourth quarter, that would be great.\nFrancis J. Shammo: John, so thanks for the question on the storms. As you know, this was an experience unprecedented from Hurricane Irene and the Tropical Storm Lee over a very short period of time. And speaking with our operating people, these storms were a really big deal for us. They produced really strong winds, about 20 inches of rain across our entire footprint, damage to our outside network facilities, phone lines. Just to give you an idea of how severe this storm was, we had over 4,000 poles down, which damaged countless cables; 820,000 more dispatches in our core, which was 2x our normal; we had about 254 central offices running off of generator because of power outages. So this storm was extremely significant impact to our normal operating results. Having said that, I think the team has done an unbelievable job in getting the repair and maintenance queue back into a relatively normal position. There's probably a couple of more weeks here, and then we'll be back running very clean there. And as I said, we recovered late in the third quarter from an installation perspective, but there will be some trickle effect here into the fourth quarter, and it's more of a top line issue, I think, in getting this revenue installed and booked and recorded than it is more of an expense issue, although I think there still will be some trickle of overtime into the fourth quarter in getting this back to speed. But the trajectory, I guess the way I would say it is we've been on a very good momentum in improving the overall Wireline margin. We've had a bit of a setback here due to the storm. We'll get back on track. As far as the Wireless margin goes, what I would say there is this goes beyond just less devices sold. This is -- we had a $1.8 billion program at the beginning of the year for Wireless to reduce cost. We're $1.6 billion into that program of savings recorded from logistics and real estate and customer service centers and other things that Wireless has worked on. So it's more just around less devices. It's more around operating the most efficient business in the industry from a Wireless perspective.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Quickly, just a follow-up on John's comment and then a bigger question. With Wireline margins maybe dragged a little bit in terms of rebound in the fourth quarter and Wireless probably down in 4Q, first, you reiterated EPS guidance, but should we be thinking sort of low end there? And is there any risk to the low end of that? And then second, in terms of a bigger question, can you talk about what you're seeing from customers and the economy? We have seen -- Enterprise decelerated a little bit here. Wholesale, you talked about it improving sequentially, but what are you seeing out there in terms of what your customers are telling you, both for this year and then their planning process for next year?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Phil, so let me hit the economy first. I think that overall from an economic impact, we are still seeing some real severe impact in the small business arena, some in the mid-tier. And again, it's not that we're losing more business competitors. That's pretty consistent. What it is, is that the startups have not been created from an economic standpoint. So I think that's where the biggest issue is that we have from an economic standpoint. Now having said that, the Enterprise, if you recall, the first and second quarter, we showed positive growth even when you take out Terremark. This quarter, we showed growth with Terremark, about a 0.5% decrease without Terremark, and that was really more around the backlog of installing the new circuits and the new business because we were really focused on the repairs and maintenance side. So that's going to -- I think we\u2019re going to improve here on the fourth quarter. We'll get quickly back on track, but from an overall Enterprise perspective, it is all around cloud services. So the Terremark asset, our security portfolio, those types of things are going to drive the Enterprise business to where we needed to go. And then overall on EPS, what I'll say is, even given this extraordinary event in the third quarter, we will hit our guidance that we gave in the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wonder if you could update us on the labor negotiations, where we stand on that and, in particular, as we come to the end of the year, the sort of the benefits outlook. Perhaps you can expand on the $0.07 charge and just talk us through what you think the impacts in the fourth quarter might be given the asset returns and given potential benefit changes as part of the union contract renegotiation.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Simon, as far as the union negotiations go, we continue to speak to the union. It's going like any negotiation goes, so as we said, this was going to be a marathon, not a quick negotiation, and we continue with those negotiations. And at this point, it's too early to tell where we'll come out. We know what we need from a business. We need cost structural change in the Wireline business. It is not sustainable with 100% benefits being paid and 100% pension benefits. So those things have to change. And then there's a lot of work rules and other things that we need to change in order to run our business efficiently and be competitive with the cable companies and our other competitors. So from that perspective, that's about it for the union negotiations. On the fourth quarter charge, it's really too early to tell because the discount rate won't be set until December 31. The return on assets, it really depends on your portfolio compared to what your assumptions were, and at this point, we don't know where we'll end up with that yet. So I think it's premature to tell, but obviously, there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in the fourth quarter. So beyond that, there's really nothing else to disclose until we get to the end of the year and we get to the January call, and we'll make sure that we explain everything that happened during that quarter.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And the $0.07, Fran?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Well on the $0.07, this was an impact we had to take a charge in the management plan, and it's really around the GAAP settlement accounting charges. So it is what it is from a GAAP perspective, and it's because the lump sum payments exceeded the periodic expense and in GAAP you have to take a settlement charge when that happens, and that happened this year -- during the quarter, I'm sorry.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.\nJennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Fran, we've all seen the big number that AT&T has put out with the iPhone 4S, and I know the iPhone is clearly, as you indicated, an important part of your portfolio. But as we look at this kind of next generation of the device, how do you see it? Because with just over a third-year base having smartphones, in my view you have a clear opportunity for upgrades. So with this device, as other iPhone users come off contract it also gives you a huge opportunity to maybe win back some new gross adds that maybe you lost when AT&T first had it. And can you just comment as you look at this mix of this device, how do you balance those 2 opportunities?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, so as far as the iPhone 4S goes, we are extremely pleased with our sales. We ran out the first day. We are on allocation from Apple. We continue to be on allocation, and we continue to be in backlog from the first 24 hours. So we're extremely pleased with that. What I will tell you, I'm not going to get into volumes. It's too early in the quarter as to how many phones I'll potentially sell. But what I will say is that the ratio of upgrade and new on the Apple phone has not changed pre and post launch. So we continue to generate that 20% new with around 80% upgrade. So we feel that third quarter performance will continue into our fourth quarter performance. And then from an overall device perspective is that the lead that we have around LTE 4G and the 15 devices including notebooks that we have in that ecosystem is unsurpassed by any competitor. And I think we have a strategic advantage here, and we sold more 4G devices this quarter than we did last quarter. I will tell you that if you look at our Internet devices, about 95% are all now 4G LTE, and that's a big deal for us because that means we are now moving high-end users on MiFi and dongles off of 3G network on to 4G, which obviously frees up spectrum and reduces our capital expense, which you saw here in the third quarter. So we're executing on the strategy that we laid out, and I think we'll have a very successful fourth quarter with our portfolio layout of devices.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Real quick, can we just get an update as to where the Wireless net debt is at the end of this third quarter? And then secondly, going back to the Wireline side, can you give us a bit of an update on where the non-FiOS territory stands in terms of performance, your need or interest to invest further in that footprint, to improve broadband capabilities and where that piece of the portfolio sits strategically for you?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Michael, so from a net debt on Wireless, they have gross debt of $12.5 billion, cash on hand of $9 billion. Net debt is $3.5 billion. On the Wireline side in the non-FiOS areas, obviously, our strategy is to complete the $18 million build for FiOS and transition that. And as you know, we've really concentrated on investing in FiOS and curtailing the investment in the copper network and moving people from copper to FiOS. And that is a big strategic initiative that Lowell has set out for the business to accomplish. Now those lines that are outside that FiOS and outside of any potential of pathing [ph] ever with FiOS, we will continue to be competitive in this area, but I think it's going to be around LTE. We're not going to invest a lot of capital in the copper core network in those outlying areas. But I think we have a strategic bundle that we can go into those households with, give them a better experience than what they're currently having on their DSL line from a bundling of the Wireless portfolio that we have. So that's the strategy that we're going to deploy.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And, Fran, just to follow-up on that, is there any thought of taking that non-FiOS bundle with the -- presumably LTE broadband, LTE voice, why not taking that more nationally and making that more of a national product for you versus just maybe an out-of-FiOS region but in-territory-of-Verizon product?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Well, we are, and you're going to see that come in the fourth quarter with the -- what we now call the cantenna, which is not a commercial name, obviously, but it's the antenna that we actually trialed with DIRECTV, which was extremely successful. And again, the benefit of this antenna is it operates the spectrum extremely efficiently. So if you look at a MiFi card or a dongle, this is very, very efficient, way above those 2 devices, which is why it's critical to have that bundle with that cantenna. So when we launch that, you're going to see us go nationally with that type of an offer.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDavid W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Fran, if I can just do 2 quick ones. Number one, are you able at this stage of the game to maybe size the upside opportunity that you guys have from this potential intercarrier comp refresh that we're expecting to come potentially at the end of the month and get implemented next year? And then second, you called out the Alltel roaming impact in the quarter. Obviously, Sprint has a game plan where over the next 2 years, they're saying that they want to get rid of about $1 billion in roaming expense from refreshing their network. Could you kind of tell us what your exposure to Sprint is and how you think about the roaming impact on 2012 and beyond?\nFrancis J. Shammo: David, so first on the intercarrier comp, and I guess I'll lump in the USF here as well, we are fully supportive of the regulatory change the FCC is heading up, not exactly what the industry is looking at but really in the right direction of cutting the access charges immediately and then phasing them out over time. Complete overhaul of the USF cost subsidy, promoting broadband and getting away from the voice subsidy and moving that to broadband, so we are all in favor of that. As far as the intercarrier comp goes, we have been a leader in this industry forcing this issue really from twofold: one, to get a more systematic approach in the entire industry; and then also to really relieve the industry of the fraud and the traffic pumping schemes that are happening with that -- throughout. So from a benefit overall perspective, we are a net payer, so obviously, there will be some benefits. But there will also be some puts and takes within our own portfolio. So if you think about it, Wireline probably won't have a benefit, but Wireless and VZB will. So with each of the individual units, once we determine what the impact of the bill -- of the regulation is and the sizing of that, then we'll have a better understanding of what those benefits are, and we'll share them at that time. As far as the Alltel roaming and then into Sprint, I know there's been a lot of numbers cast out there, but the impact to us is nowhere near the numbers that are being reported. So all I will tell you is this, is that there has to be a lot of execution in order for that to happen. Our revenue is not material at all from Sprint. So I think that there's a lot of numbers being thrown out but not a lot of justification behind the number that's being thrown out, especially from where I sit on my side of the house. So I think we'll just have to wait and see what the execution of that plan is, but I don't think this is a near-term issue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You talked earlier about how some of the margin strength you saw in Wireless during the quarter was not just a function of a slowdown in gross adds you had in the iPhone but also some of the cost measures you\u2019ve put in place. If we think ahead though, you will probably see a pretty meaningful improvement in your gross adds in the fourth quarter. I mean, just by way of thinking about this from order of magnitude, if you were to end up in the fourth quarter with a high watermark for postpaid net adds, does that mean you would be at a low watermark for EBITDA margins? Or have you actually put in place enough operational cost savings that you could come in a little bit better than that?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Well, Brett, I think I'll reiterate what I said at the beginning of the year. We're going to have peaks and valleys here as phones come and phones go. Obviously, the fourth quarter every year, due to holiday season, we tend to sell more phones. When we sell more phones, our margins will go down, but I think we've proven that even with the initial launch and now into the -- where we are, we have managed both sides of the balance here. We've gone for growth. We are very concentrated on profitability and a free cash flow, so I think we'll wait and see how the fourth quarter comes out. But look, I mean, obviously, we are extremely focused on the profitability and the free cash flow of this business, so we will continue to be disciplined around capital and so forth and deliver what we need to deliver.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just one quick point there since you mentioned cash flow. Maybe I missed it but I don't think you talked about your CapEx outlook for the rest of the year. I think you said previously, you'll be flat. Year-over-year, are you still looking for that or maybe a little lighter based on where you are with Wireless?\nFrancis J. Shammo: The guidance was $16.5 billion, and I said that we would decelerate in the back half of the year, and we are still right on track to deliver at that $16.5 billion. So if you do the math for the fourth quarter, you'll see that Wireless will be about maybe slightly higher than it was in the third quarter but not much. And Wireline will be right on track, so $16.5 billion is where we'll end up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities.\nMichael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Fran, could you just make a comment -- AT&T is out there with -- I guess they ran out of inventory but probably getting more in 4Q on the 3GS for free and also the lower price on the iPhone 4. Do you guys have any thoughts on sort of the competitive landscape going into or -- we\u2019re already in 4Q, but on trying to meet some of those offerings that AT&T is with -- is out there with? And then secondarily, maybe just some commentary around your customers that signed up and have contracts on the iPhone 4. What is the behavior there? Are they coming back to you looking for an upgrade of the 4S and how are you reacting to that?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Two things, Mike. I mean, obviously, as we have said and continue to say in the past, when we compete on a paratable [ph] basis, we outperform and have outperformed the entire industry, and we don't think that will change, so we will compete extremely heavily even with the -- another provider getting the Apple iPhone. It doesn't really concern us. We will compete, and when we compete head-to-head, we generally win in that competition. So we'll continue to out-execute where we can and continue to deliver both profits and cash flow. The other thing is, is that if you look at the net adds, I mean, obviously, that speaks for itself, and we believe that, that will continue into the fourth quarter. Now as far as customers on the 4 -- the Apple 4 and the 4S, no, what we're seeing is that, as you know, the Apple 4 can be upgraded with software to almost get to almost 95% of what the S has in it. Now it's a long process to get that software upgrade in the phone, but 4 customers have come in and asked for the upgrade, and that's how we're handling that.\nMichael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Just one more if I can. On the Digital Voice connections, kind of a random question, but Digital Voice connections were 265,000 in the quarter, which was much higher than FiOS Internet and TV. Is there some sort of promotion you're running there? Or how should we think about that?\nFrancis J. Shammo: No, again, Mike, this goes to our strategy of moving people to the new technology, and there's really a 2-phased approach here. As we move people to FiOS, obviously, our operating cost structure gets benefited by almost 2x because the amount of truck rolls that I have on copper versus FiOS is about 2x. So by moving those customers off copper on to digital FiOS, I eliminate that copper truck roll into that home. So it is all around the strategy of eliminating the amount of folks I have on copper and the reduction of our operating expenses in the Wireline business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Larsen of Piper Jaffray.\nChristopher M. Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: A couple of questions on Wireless as well. One of the things I think that you guys have looked at doing to help margins is extend the upgrade rates, and I know we've had questions on the iPhone, but can you talk a little bit about some of the things that you've done including eliminating the 2 every new (sic) [New Every Two] program and where your upgrade -- months to upgrade has been moving? And then secondly, I saw that -- it looks like prepaid, a nice or decent growth here this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment around prepaid and what's going on there?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Chris, so on the upgrade rates, we were actually at 8.6% this quarter, so that was slightly down from the past 2 quarters of 9%. So the upgrade rate is pretty much steady as course -- in the course. The decline in the upgrade rate this quarter was due to the people anticipating the new iPhone. But from a change of policy, we changed that midyear last year where we eliminated the New Every Two credit and some other things that we did, and we really haven't found any impact to the upgrade. What we have found is that not much financial benefit this year, but there will be more financial benefit in 2012 by the change of that policy, so we think that was beneficial for us from a longer-term perspective. On the prepaid side of the house, we are starting to see some momentum here. As you know, we launched the Unleashed product on 9/15, which was the same time that we entered into our new distribution agreement with RadioShack. And really, too preliminary to tell, but I believe that based on the preliminary effects of what happened since we did launch that product, we will see some improvement in prepaid, and I think -- I'm hopeful that if you eliminate the tablets from prepaid, we will actually show some net add positive growth for the first time in a while in our prepaid voice category. So this month -- this quarter, just to clarify, our prepaid voice was down about 52,000. Now that was an improvement from the second quarter, which was 179,000. So the Unleashed product and bringing the distribution of RadioShack has already started to show that improvement in the last 15 days of the quarter, so I think we're going to compete extremely well in the fourth quarter on our Unleashed product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a clarification, a couple of clarifications actually. First On CapEx, Fran, are we looking for $9.6 billion-ish in Wireless CapEx for this year if 4Q is going to be a little bit above 3Q? And then where does that go for next year just for Wireless specifically? And then in terms of the impacts to wholesale ARPU, was the $60 million all AT&T -- stuff that you divested to AT&T, has it now moved off of your network? Or is it moving revenues from the wholesale category to the retail category within the Alltel subset [ph] that you kept?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Jonathan, so on the CapEx side, the plan that's for Wireless is at the $8.9 billion number, and they'll come in on that number. And as far as next year goes, we're not going to talk about 2012 at this point. From a wholesale perspective, not all $61 million of that was roaming. I said the majority of it was. There was some decline in our reseller base as well, but that was really just the properties of Alltel, that they roamed on us, and now they've converted it to their network. So keep in mind we sold those properties to AT&T, so they're their properties, and they moved that traffic to their network, which we planned for. We knew they were going to do it, so it's not a surprise.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital.\nJames M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division: If you could talk a little bit about the ARPU impact on voice you're actually seeing directly connected to operating the smartphones, if customers actually are looking at that as an opportunity to tune their voices and should we expect, as eventually smartphones to move forward into flatter part of the S-curve, that the pressure on voice could abate?\nFrancis J. Shammo: James, actually from a voice perspective, we've actually seen a little bit of an improvement on the dilution of the voice revenue. So we're not seeing any more change right now with people going to smartphones and talking less on the phone. The dilution of that has been pretty consistent, but obviously, the data and the ARPU on the overall customer is increasing. So we had a very nice ARPU increase this quarter, and I expect that to continue into the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Peter Rhamey of BMO Capital Markets.\nPeter Rhamey - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Fran, you talked about scaling efficiencies in U-verse as you've curtailed your network deployment and of course, you're only marketing to just 13, 14 million homes right now. I was wondering if you could take us through whether that's going to be a material margin improvement on a go-forward basis in U-verse and whether we'd see it in the consolidated results or is it just directionally a positive for your company on Wireline?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Peter, I'm assuming you're talking about FiOS, right?\nPeter Rhamey - BMO Capital Markets Canada: FiOS, excuse me. My apologies.\nFrancis J. Shammo: It's all right. Yes, so from a -- just from an overall perspective, the biggest cost content of FiOS is obviously content, but the profitability of FiOS continues to increase quarter-over-quarter as we monitor it. The operating income is continuing to improve, so the operating efficiency of FiOS is there. The issue that Lowell has set out for the business, which is the absolute right strategic decision, is move folks off of copper onto FiOS because the operating efficiency of FiOS is far better than the operating cost of the legacy copper network. So I think as we do that, we will continue to show the momentum of Wireline overall margin improvement going forward.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks for everybody for joining us this morning. Brad, that concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning are Fran Shammo, Verizon's Chief Financial Officer; and Lowell McAdam; Verizon's newly-elected President and Chief Executive Officer effective August 1.  Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to point out that our second quarter includes the results of Terremark since the acquisition closed in early April. As we go through the presentation, we will point out the effects on certain growth rates as appropriate.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis Shammo: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief overview commentary adding my perspective to our second quarter results. We had a very strong quarter, continuing the positive momentum from earlier this year. Our results clearly demonstrate that we are executing well in our key areas of focus and driving profitable growth.  Our top line revenue growth accelerated to 6.3% year-over-year, which is a 100 basis point increase from our first quarter growth rate of 5.3%. This was our strongest quarter of consolidated revenue growth in 2.5 years.  In Wireless, we had an outstanding quarter of customer growth, with strong demand for smartphones and Internet data devices and increasing service revenue, driving total revenue growth of 10.2%. We also saw continued improvement in Wireline revenue, with higher Global Enterprise revenue driven primarily by improvements in Strategic Services.  EBITDA margins this quarter expanded sequentially in both Wireless and Wireline, as we continue to focus on driving top line growth as well as improving our operating efficiency. In Wireless, our EBITDA service margin expanded 170 basis points from first quarter to 45.4%, an impressive result in light of increased postpaid customer growth, continued smartphone penetration and Internet device expansion. In Wireline, the EBITDA margin increased by 20 basis points to 23.8%, our fifth consecutive quarter of margin improvement, through a combination of better revenue performance and our continued focus on cost containment. Our second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share is a very solid result, up from $0.51 in the first quarter and demonstrates good execution and the strength of our business model and the strategy that we discussed with you back in January.  With that, let's begin a more detailed review of the quarter on Slide 4 starting with consolidated results. As I just highlighted, we have strong top line growth in the second quarter, with consolidated revenue increasing to $27.5 billion, up $1.6 billion or 6.3% year-over-year. By capitalizing on the growth opportunities in Wireless, FiOS and enterprise Strategic Services, together with improving our wholesale business, our consolidated revenue trends continue to be very positive. Our consolidated EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $9 billion, up 5.2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, our consolidated EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 32.7%.  In terms of earnings, again, as I highlighted in the overview, we had a very strong quarter, reporting $0.57 of EPS without any nonoperational or special items. This compares favorably with $0.51 last quarter and $0.51 in the second quarter of 2010, after making the necessary adjustments for the impact of divested operations and nonoperational charges in that period. So a solid performance as far as driving growth to the bottom line, representing an 11.8% increase in EPS on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Year-to-date earnings totaled $1.07 per share, up 8.1% over the same time last year. Again, our overall first half performance confirms the strength of the business and the path that we are on to create long-term shareholder value. Let's turn to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our cash flow results for the quarter showed a significant sequential improvement, driven by higher revenue growth, margin expansion and favorable changes in working capital, some of which were timing-related, as I indicated last quarter. In terms of capital expenditures, while we've had a higher level of spending in the first half compared with last year, our additional investments are in support of increased customer volumes and higher revenue growth in Wireless.  First half CapEx this year totaled $8.9 billion, of which $5.4 billion was Wireless. As we discussed before, we started this year more aggressively in Wireless. To date, our network spending of 3G is well ahead of our capacity requirements for the full year, and we have also spent a bit more on 4G LTE consistent with our deployment plans. Based on our current forecast, I expect Wireless capital expenditures to decrease in the second half of 2011.  In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $3.1 billion for the first half, which is down 5.9% year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, capital spending in the second half will be lower than the first half. For the full year, we are targeting capital expenditures to be similar to 2010 at about $16.5 billion. In terms of free cash flow, we've generated $3.9 billion for the first 6 months, and although this is lower than recent trends, our cash flow outlook for the balance of the year remains very strong especially in light of the lower capital requirements.  From a balance sheet perspective, our financial position remains strong. Net debt at the end of June was $47.7 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at about 1.4x. We also closed the Terremark acquisition and refinanced about $800 million of their debt at more favorable rates.  On Slide 6, we displayed second quarter revenues for each of the last 3 years, which is a good illustration of the transformation and growth of our revenue base. As we've pointed out in prior quarters, about 77% of our revenues are in strategic areas of higher growth, up from about 70% 2 years ago. With our continued emphasis on advancing the deployment of our 4G LTE network in Wireless, with our all fiber network in mass markets and through our global reach and cloud computing capabilities for enterprise customers, we continue to be well positioned to drive higher top line growth as the strategic transformation of Verizon continues. Let's now move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless business had a very impressive quarter, with accelerated growth in postpaid connections, higher service revenue growth, continued strong postpaid phone ARPU growth, improvement in customer churn and greater profitability and free cash flow.  Total revenue grew to $17.3 billion in the quarter, up 10.2% year-over-year, with a 6.6% increase in total service revenue. This year-over-year growth in total service revenue is 30 basis points higher than the 6.3% we reported in the first quarter. Total quarterly data revenue grew to $5.8 billion, up $1.1 billion or 22.2% year-over-year. Data revenue now represents 39.5% of our total service revenue.  As you know, a key driver of data growth has been the increased penetration of smartphones. We continue to make good progress on that front, increasing penetration of our retail postpaid phone base from 32% last quarter to 36% this quarter. Just one year ago, smartphone penetration was 21%. Within the postpaid category, we are also seeing very strong demand for our Internet data devices, particularly 4G, mobile hotspots or MiFi devices and dongles. We are the market leader in these devices, with a large and growing number of these customer connections now representing more than 7.5% of our retail postpaid base.  In many cases, these data-only devices represent an additional connection as a growing number of customers have more than one device. I would also point out that while the revenues are clearly additive to our top line, these devices have a very short payback period as they typically carry a much lower subsidy than the phones within our portfolio.  Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8. We are clearly gaining market share in the retail postpaid market, driven by increasing demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. During the second quarter, we added 2.2 million total connections, of which nearly 1.3 million were retail postpaid. This was our highest quarter of postpaid additions since the fourth quarter of 2008.  Within the 1.3 million postpaid additions, about 60% were phones. In the retail prepaid category, we had net additions of 61,000. Of note were 241,000 prepaid tablets, which are contributing to sequential growth and prepaid ARPU. Outside of the retail category, we added about 890,000 wholesale and other connections this quarter. Only a small percentage of these net adds were the typical reseller phone devices. A majority of these additions were vehicle tracking, telematics and machine-to-machine devices.  While our focus will continue to remain very heavily on the retail postpaid market, which represents more than 80% of our total connections, we are also broadening our portfolio of machine-to-machine connections. And while these connections generally have lower monthly revenue profiles, they represent incremental revenue at a very high profit margin.  At our Verizon Innovation Center in Waltham, companies, entrepreneurs and others across the LTE ecosystem are coming together to create the next generation of products and solutions that will deliver the power and possibilities of 4G LTE. We expect this to be an increasing area of growth for us in the future, and we'll continue to expand our M2M offerings.  Total device sales, gross adds and upgrades were strong once again this quarter. We had postpaid gross adds of more than 3.5 million, which is an increase of more than 20% year-over-year, and about 9% of our retail postpaid customer base upgraded to a new device. About 90% of the postpaid devices sold this quarter were phones, with roughly 60% of these being 3G and 4G smartphones. Also noteworthy is the fact that half of all Internet data device sales this quarter were 4G LTE.  This strong demand across all product lines is not only increasing our postpaid connections and driving revenue growth but is also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.89%, our lowest in 3 years.  Next, let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at retail postpaid ARPU. Throughout last year, we saw accelerating retail postpaid ARPU growth, starting with 0.6% in the first quarter and steadily ramping to 2.5% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2011, our retail postpaid ARPU growth was 2.2%. This quarter, retail postpaid ARPU growth was 1.9%.  To enhance the understanding around the growth trend of this blended metric, it is important to note that there are a few different dynamics occurring within the category, which, while having an impact on the growth rate of the ARPU metric, are quite positive and strong indicators of future revenue growth. The first thing to recognize is that retail postpaid phone ARPU is higher than the blended postpaid metric of $54.12.  As we've illustrated on this slide, the rate of growth has increased significantly in the past year to 3.2% this quarter, driven of course by the increase in smartphone penetration. That said, within the postpaid category, the significant unit growth in Internet data devices, while adding total service revenue growth and expansion of the category, is having a dilutive effect on the total postpaid ARPU rate of growth at this point in time. Within the Internet data device category, we are seeing strong demand for our mobile hotspot or MiFi devices, dongles and tablets, while the unit growth is very strong and the key area of focus for us in expanding this category, the average ARPU on these devices, is less than $54 and is declining on a year-over-year basis. We are seeing some migration of 3G customers who were paying about $60 per month to a new 4G device at a $50 per month price point. These pricing plans are intended to expand the category, while delivering high profitability, and we already see evidence of this in our second quarter margin result.  The strategy within this category of devices is to build share so that we can benefit from the significant growth in usage we anticipate in the future. We are confident that the innovation will drive the development of bandwidth-intensive video and data applications that will appeal to consumers and provide utility for enterprise customers.  By gaining a strong foothold in this market, particularly when you think about the potential for tablets, we have a great opportunity to benefit from this increased video and data usage. Together with our move to tier pricing, where the next price point for 10 megabits is $80 per month, we believe that as we move into 2012 and 2013, these trends will provide ARPU accretion in this category. To date, the very strong demand for these devices is resulting in strong revenue growth, albeit at lower ARPU than with phones. The other positive element to the sale of 4G LTE devices is the migration of data traffic from our 3G to our 4G network, which is highly desirable from a capital efficiency and profitability perspective and will help us drive improved returns into the future.  Stepping back from the postpaid ARPU metric, it is important to note that total data revenue continues to be sourced primarily from Web and e-mail services, which increased to $3.4 billion this quarter, up more than 35% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 1/3 of data revenue, is still showing growth, albeit at a slower pace at nearly 6% on a year-over-year basis. With regard to Apple iPhone 4, we activated 2.3 million units this quarter, bringing our total to 4.5 million since we started selling the phone in early February. Sales have been steady, and in fact, is one of the top performing phones on our 3G network in terms of voice quality with the least number of dropped or lost calls and high overall customer satisfaction.  As far as 4G devices are concerned, we have been very pleased with the sales to date. As you know, we have 9 LTE devices in the market today: 3 smartphones, 2 mobile hotspots, 3 laptop dongles and 1 tablet for pre-order with availability very soon. During the quarter, we sold a total of 1.2 million 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices.  In terms of an update on our LTE deployment, we are now providing service in 102 markets covering more than 160 million PoPs. We are well on track with our plan to have coverage of 185 million PoPs or better by the end of 2011. Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the second quarter, we generated $6.7 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 2.5% year-over-year and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 170 basis points sequentially to 45.4%. This margin is a very strong result against the backdrop of an increasing number of device sales.  To me, this speaks to our strategy of increasing growth and profitability and clearly demonstrates how we create long-term shareholder value. Again, the combination of top line growth and effective cost controls give me confidence in our ability to sustain our industry-leading profitability and free cash flow generation. We are encouraged by the strong demand for our products and the positive implications for revenue growth. Going forward, you can expect us to effectively deliver both growth and profitability with a continued strong focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market. Within this market, we will continue to expand the Internet data device category, including tablets and further increase the penetration of smartphones to drive revenue growth and long-term profitability. Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. We continue to see improving revenue trends in our Wireline business. Total revenue in the second quarter was $10.2 billion, a 0.3% year-over-year decline. While the inclusion of Terremark added about 100 basis points of growth, this still marks solid improvement over the 2.2% decline in the first quarter.  In mass markets, our FiOS broadband and video products continue to drive a positive shift in our revenue mix. FiOS now accounts for 57% of consumer revenue, up from 48% a year ago. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 20.7% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU is more than $146.  In Global Enterprise, revenue growth improved to 3.6% year-over-year, driven by strong Strategic Services growth of 17.8%. Again, the inclusion of Terremark added $98 million to second quarter enterprise revenue.  As we've said, Strategic Services are becoming a much larger portion of our revenue mix, now representing 48% of total enterprise. Within this category, advanced services like Managed Network Solutions, Contact Center Solutions, IP Communications and our cloud offerings are growing very nicely.  From a profitability perspective, segment EBITDA increased $128 million or 5.5% year-over-year resulting in a 140 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin to 23.8% primarily as a result of our workforce reduction initiatives in 2010. On a sequential basis, this marked the fifth consecutive quarter of EBITDA margin improvement. Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Within the mass markets category, consumer revenue of $3.4 billion grew 1.3% versus last year. Consumer ARPU grew to $92.44, an increase of 9.4% from a year ago. Residential access line loss this quarter was 8.2% compared with 10% a year ago. The continued penetration of our broadband and video products have increased the scale of our FiOS platform and is now significant enough to more than offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business.  We had another solid quarter of customer growth in FiOS TV adding 184,000 subscribers for a total of 3.8 million TV customers. Our FiOS TV penetration at the end of the quarter was 30%. On the broadband side, we added 189,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the quarter. Our FiOS Internet customer base increased to 4.5 million, representing 34% penetration of homes open for sale.  By adding in our 4.1 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.6 million broadband connections. This reflects an overall increase of 62,000 broadband connections. Our strategy of driving penetration in existing markets has been effective, and we intend to maintain this momentum as penetration continues to improve in all of our FiOS markets. Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 13. Within Global Enterprise, Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement, led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP Communications and our cloud offerings. As we experienced last quarter, the absolute dollar growth in Strategic Services outpaced the dollar decline in core Enterprise Services.  In Global Wholesale, revenues declined 7.4% year-over-year. As we've discussed, our route rationalization strategy resulted in a substantial decline in International Voice revenue of about $111 million this quarter on a year-over-year basis. Since these price changes were initiated in mid-2010, we have 1 or 2 more quarters to work through before the comparative impact of these actions moderates. Absent these effects, second quarter Global Wholesale revenues declined 2.9% year-over-year. This decline is primarily in Domestic Voice where we continue to experience secular pressures and lower usage volumes. I will wrap up here with a summary slide to highlight our second half of 2011 areas of focus. We had a strong first half of the year, demonstrating solid execution of our strategy while increasing profitability. In the second half of the year, you can expect us to continue to drive strong top line growth in our key strategic areas.  We have great momentum in Wireless, and we expect to build on that strength. We're seeing continued demand for our existing 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices, with more smartphones, tablets and data devices in the pipeline.  In FiOS, we will continue to drive higher penetration in our existing markets and capture pent-up demand in new markets. In the enterprise space, we continue to enhance our position as a leading global provider in the information technology solution space. With the integration of Terremark well underway, we have improved our ability to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure, providing us with a significant opportunity in this high-growth part of the market.  While achieving higher top line growth is great, we must ensure that this is profitable and sustainable. Our focus is on driving growth in products and services that are not only increasing our market share, but also expanding margins and improving profitability.  I can assure you that the business will remain very focused on our cost structure and achieving meaningful cost reductions. The strategic actions and execution of our plans have strengthened our Wireless and Wireline businesses.  Our objective is to continue to drive increases in free cash flow through improved operating performance, disciplined capital spending and the efficient use of working capital. We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and a very competitive dividend, as this is critical component of shareholder value creation. So I will end there, and it gives me great pleasure to now turn the call over to our newly-elected President and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam.\nLowell McAdam: Thank you, Fran, and good morning everyone on the call. Today is obviously an important day for Verizon as we transition the CEO role from Ivan to me.  This has been a very smooth transition by any measure, and we have Ivan to thank for that. He has had a very clear plan from the beginning, and that is to keep the focus on customers and our investors.  I want to be sure that I say to investors on my first day on the job that I understand the obligations that come with this position and that is to deliver bottom line results. Ivan has built a tremendous company over his 18 years of leadership. He has moved this business from a regional wireline voice business to the leading national wireless company and to a Global Enterprise technology company.  I believe we can accelerate that transformation to a global solutions and networking company. I believe that the pieces are already in place to do that, and that we are showing good momentum in our results to further fuel that transformation.  Morning Fran has done his usual highly professional job explaining the results. A few things stand out for me. First, Wireless continues to show strong growth and industry-leading profitability. We have been through many transitions of devices and technology. The consistency of results in the face of a highly competitive and dynamic market show the underlying strength of our team and our operations.  Second, the FiOS strategy has proven itself by taking share and gaining revenues. Our enterprise strategy, fueled by the MCI, the Cybertrust and now, the Terremark acquisition, is producing a highly-successful portfolio of services that are being rapidly adopted by our customers.  And finally, I see a cost-control mindset that is driving overall profitability. While my optimism is certainly based on performance, I also see tremendous potential ahead. First, I'm pleased with the organization structure and the management team that we've put in place last October. They're rolling up their sleeves and diving into many opportunities to reengineer our processes and policies. This will streamline our operations to deliver better service to our customers and better cost performance. Second, we have leading-edge technology platforms in FiOS, LTE, our IP backbone and now the cloud. These investments will pay dividends now and in the future. As we see far more demand for video, data and enterprise applications, we are better positioned than any other company to meet evolving customer needs.  Third, we've begun to effectively partner to drive innovation for our customers. Some of the most innovative companies in ours and adjacent industries are working in our existing innovation center in Waltham, Massachusetts and the soon-to-be opened sister center in San Francisco. We see an exciting roadmap of new consumer and business products on the horizon. Finally, I am pleased with the evolution of our partnership with Vodafone. We are clearly moving from a purely financial partnership to an operating partnership. We are now facing our largest multinational customers as one team. We've aligned our product and our technology roadmaps, and we are beginning to purchase infrastructure together. All of these actions will begin to enhance our revenue and our cost profiles.  As my last comment, I'd say we have just finished taking the top 300 leaders of Verizon through a class we call leading for shareholder value. Fran and I teach significant sections of the class, which focuses on how we can drive the business to higher returns. I am very pleased by the reaction of the senior team and their commitment to our success. We use the term, there's always a higher gear, meaning no matter where you are in the business, there are opportunities to improve. That's what makes being part of Verizon so exciting, and that's what positions us so well for the future.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to John. Thank you.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Lowell. Brad, that concludes our opening segment of the call. Let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank: I guess the question is for Fran. I'm trying to maybe get a sense for the trends in Wireless ARPU and basically what happened between the 2.8% growth in margin and what we saw in the first quarter. It sounds like -- for the second quarter, it sounds like it's a mix -- it's a combination of increased mix of connected devices and some ARPU pressure within each category. And specifically, you mentioned that the migration from 3G to 4G putting pressure on ARPU because those are lower-priced devices. If you could give us a sense for maybe the magnitude of which one was the larger of the drivers. And two, maybe how far through that migration of customers from 3G to 4G ROE, how much more pressure do you expect from that specific issue? And maybe give us a sense for what you expect for ARPU trends going forward in the postpaid side.\nFrancis Shammo: John, so this is -- I'm glad the question came because this is one that's important. So if you look at -- we've actually disclosed the new metric that we now call phone ARPU, which consists of our smartphones and our feature phones. And again, this quarter, we saw a very good uptick from feature phone to smartphone, about 53% with the Apple phone, transforming from the feature phone into the smartphone. So we're seeing that 3.2% continuing into the future. I think the important thing here is though is on the Internet devices, and it's important to know because if you go back to October of last year when the market changed pricing on all of Internet devices, we actually launched Internet pricing at $35 per 3 gig; $50 for 5 and $80 for 10. And as we saw the market and we expanded the market in this category with also the innovation of the 4G LTE network and now all the devices that we have on that. In May, we actually pulled the $35 price point from the marketplace. So that was part of the contribution of why we saw an acceleration of the dilution in the Internet ARPU. We have now since pulled that, so now the entry point is $50 stepping up to $80. So we've made that change, and I think that in itself will start to see improvement in the third quarter. But needless to say, the amount of devices and the volume within the 4G network we're very pleased with, with moving 1.2 million devices this quarter. And as you said, John, we are seeing folks who are coming off of their contracts on 3G moving over to the 4G and stepping down from their legacy pricing of the $60 and $70 price point down to the $50 price point. But I also want to make sure that it's important to realize that these devices are a much lower subsidy, and the profitability on these devices are extremely high. So it's the right thing to do. We're expanding the category. We're seeing the expansion with our tablets, with our 4G network with tablets, where we now have our first 4G tablet coming to marketplace. It can be pre-ordered, and we think that, that will also make a dynamic change here. The other thing that I want to talk about ARPU and something that I've mentioned before is because of the dynamics of the industry and the way it's changing, we now have a number of tablets being sold as prepaid. So what you saw this quarter is -- and the sequential accretion in the prepaid ARPU because we're placing more and more tablets onto a prepaid pricing system. The other thing that's interesting to note is more than 50% of these prepaid customers are buying at $35 and higher price points even on the prepaid plan. So this strategy is working. I think we'll continue to expand this, but I do think that we'll see continued pressure in the Internet device category.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank: So Fran, do you expect total service revenue growth to continue to accelerate from here?\nFrancis Shammo: I believe we're going to be seeing continued acceleration of service growth.\nLowell McAdam: John, this is Lowell. Just if I look back over my 20-some years on the Wireless side, every time we brought in new devices, we brought in new use cases, we saw nice expansion of the market. And I think that's just what you see going on here today. In some ways, it's similar to when we all went to family share plans. So there was a big concern over what ARPU was going to do. But we expanded the market nicely, great profitability, and I think that's exactly what's going on here now. And so we feel very good about the position.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: You talked about the Vodafone partnership and opportunities. Can you talk about the dividend potential, where the sort of negotiations stand and what sort of timing and type of payment we should be expecting there?\nLowell McAdam: Sure. So I'll let Fran talk specifically about the dividend here. But I think that Vittorio's and my goal over the last 18 months have really been to try to turn the temperature down a little bit and to improve the bottom line of the relationship. So we've really focused -- because we knew LTE was on the horizon here, we started out by focusing on aligning the technology roadmaps, and that will go all the way through purchasing network equipment together as they're a little bit behind us because they don't have the spectrum for LTE, but they're beginning that ramp now. We also have heard very clearly from the large enterprise customers that combining the assets of Verizon business, meaning the global IP backbone and their data center infrastructure, and that's -- an exclamation point went on that with the Terremark purchase, that we could provide a global fix and mobile solution. So we've now -- we have teams that -- its one team made up of Verizon and Vodafone employees that face our top 50 accounts, and we're going to be expanding that very quickly. And there's a number of other smaller, but those are the main ones. Now regarding the dividend, we've been very clear that there will be a dividend. And why don't I let Fran just talk a little bit about the mechanics.\nFrancis Shammo: I think, Simon, at this point, I've made my comments on the dividend. I don't think there's really anything else to comment on, on the dividend.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Fran, I might've missed it, but could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of LTE speeds and maybe monthly over monthly data usage? And then on the margin front, you had a great sequential growth there, about 130 basis points on a consolidated basis. Could you talk about maybe the trends over the next few quarters and where you think you can be kind of longer term at this point? You've had almost a decade of restructuring in the business and a lot obviously upgrades to the infrastructure, and you're still substantially below where the margins used to be historically.\nFrancis Shammo: Yes, Tim, on the LTE speeds, we're seeing consistent from what we had disclosed before. We don't get into disclosure of any 4G LTE device usage at this point. Again, I think it's too early to really get a good average on what those speeds will be amongst all the different devices that we have there. As far as on the consolidated margin basis, I think I'll be consistent to say that our business strategy and what we disclosed back in January, I think it proves that we have proven that the strategy is working. We're expanding the market. We're growing our top line, and I think that the margin will follow here based on what Lowell just said where our main points of concentration are, which is the top line growth in all of our different business segments and taking cost out of the business.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Maybe a couple of questions. First on capital spending. You obviously talked about flat this year. I'm just wondering from here if there are opportunities. Obviously, FiOS spending starts to wind down. Would you expect to sort of reinvest the declines in FiOS spending into either Wireless or Enterprise? Or do we continue to have sort of an outlook of flat to maybe even down capital spending as we look beyond the year? And then second, just on enterprise, maybe some of the SME trends. You have choppy macro data points from here. Did they give you any pause about the momentum you're seeing in that business as you look at the balance of the year?\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, I'll answer the first one, Jason. I'll let Lowell take the enterprise one. On the capital spending side, I think we'll just stick with 2011 at this point. And as you know, we spent $8.5 billion worth in the units. We're a total of $8.9 billion for the first half. And as I said back in January, we would be a little different this year because, historically, we've always kind of accelerated our capital expend through the year, and I was very clear at the beginning that said we would have an acceleration in the first half and then a decline because we felt that the capacity of EVDO was built out, and we still are very comfortable with that projection. So you should see that decline coming in the second half of this year. And I think at this point, we know that we still have LFA requirements on the FiOS build of about 1 million homes for the next 2 years. So I don't see any major change on premise past perspective, at least for the next 2 years out. And we said that we would commit on passing 18 million homes, and Lowell and I've said that we would stop there. And then based on penetration rates into the future, then we will make those decisions. So at this point, we'll stick with the flat for 2011, and we'll come back later and talk about the outer years.\nLowell McAdam: On the enterprise question, Jason, and macro trends, I would love to be able to tell you that we see significant improvement in the overall economic outlook, but we can't really say that at this point. What we see is a shift. And whereas 2 years ago, you were seeing a lot of enterprise expansion, now we're actually able to capitalize on the cost reduction plans of these enterprises. So I think that's why cloud is picking up significantly for us as well as some of our other Strategic Services because the IT department is looking for an opportunity to take advantage of our scale and our applications and so they're shifting -- we're seeing some nice shifts of business. But as far as overall, do we see the economy coming out of this flat plateau? We say, no. I can't say that we see that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc: Just coming back to the Wireline side, can you help frame the margin opportunity for Wireline both over the next couple quarters and next few years especially in front of the labor negotiations. And maybe within that context you can give us an update there.\nLowell McAdam: Okay, why don't I just make a comment. This is Lowell, on the labor side, Mike, and then Fran can add additional thoughts. I think the tone is good with the union so far. We have lots of dialogue. I think they've been very professional. We understand and I think -- I won't speak for them, but it's clear that when you see the core Access Line decline and you see the pressures on the Wireline business, that some things do need to change. And yes, we've asked for some changes in our work rules, and we've asked for them to consider coming on to the general employee and management medical plans. Those are probably the big issues. I think we're just coming into the time where we enter into serious negotiations as we get close to the August 6 date. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able to work something through that'll be fair and equitable to both sides.\nFrancis Shammo: Yes, Mike, on the margin side, I think I've been pretty consistent, and we've delivered consecutive margin improvement for the last 5 quarters. And I'll commit again that our business strategy is to continue to improve the Wireline margin through top line growth, as well as cost containments. And as Lowell always tells me, there's plenty of pots of gold out there to go after in the Wireline business. So we will continue to take cost out and really concentrate on those strategic revenue growth opportunities within the Wireline business, consisting of FiOS, the enterprise side and especially with the acquisition of Terremark. So I think our plan is there, we just have to execute on our strategy.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc: And can you disclose the ending net debt balance for Verizon Wireless?\nFrancis Shammo: For this quarter, it's about $6 billion.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Two questions, if I could, real quick. Number one, even stripping out Terremark from the Global Enterprise, it was a nice, healthy tickup in 2Q versus 1Q, but we didn't really see that in the small medium business segment. Could you talk about the different dynamics that are driving those kind of businesses in different directions right now? And the second, if I could, just quickly on kind of the iPhone and LTE sales. Could you talk about what percentage was new to the base and what percentage was upgrades?\nFrancis Shammo: Sure, Dave. So with that, on the small business side, and I'm assuming that you're -- let me just get a clarification here. You're looking at the, really the SOHO business within the Wireline segment, which was actually down by 5.2% this quarter. And I think what's happening here is that we're seeing additional line loss in that segment. Now the actual Internet and broadband connection in that segment was actually positive for us this quarter, but we did see an acceleration of line loss. And I think what I would contribute it to is if you look at the national startup of small businesses, we are down on a national basis over 50% from where we were last year on startups. So I think it's an inflection of we don't have as much coming in the door to offset that line loss. And the line loss is not increasing but it's consistent. So I think we saw a little bit of a different dynamic in that 0 to 20 SOHO business, which created that acceleration there. But it's nothing that I'm overly concerned about. It's not a big portion of our portfolio. But it is definitely something that Lowell, I and the team are very focused on that we need to turn here in the future. And then on the iPhone LTE mix, the iPhone upgrade to new is pretty consistent with the first quarter, 22% to 23% new and the rest were upgrades.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Wondering if we could dig in a little bit on the handsets. First, if you could talk about the smartphone mix of handsets overall. At the beginning of the year, we talked about that going up to 50%, and it doesn't look like it's going to quite make it. Do you see anything in the second half to sort of ramp up that upgrade rate to get smartphones higher? And then second, if you could help us on the LTE of 1.2 million, can you give us any kind of breakout between phones and data devices?\nLowell McAdam: Let me take the first part of that one. I think, Phil, the handset and smartphone mix, we like the gross add mix that we see coming in here. We're in a roughly 60% kind of range. We are probably what I would view as maybe a quarter behind what we had talked about in January, primarily because we expected an iPhone 5 refresh sometime this summer. We don't know when the next one's going to come out. You'll have to ask Apple that, but we expect that probably sometime in the fall. And I think you'll see a significant jump there when we get to that point. On the LTE side, I can't tell you how pleased I am at how the device manufacturers have stepped up with all kinds of devices, and we're beginning to see, even in the machine-to-machine space, LTE modules because the latency is so much better than we have in a 3G environment. Our fourth quarter lineup is going to be very robust, and you've seen -- you've gotten a little bit of a peek at that through devices like the Samsung Charge. The screen density is significantly better than what we've seen in the past. So I think we're going to have, probably in my entire career, the best fourth quarter lineup of devices I've seen, which will shift that mix that you talked about.\nFrancis Shammo: And then, Phil, on the -- just the breakout of LTE. What I will say -- because I'm not going to break out individual devices here, but what I will say is if you take our 4G devices and our Apple device, it accounted for 69% of our net adds for the quarter. So that is definitely executed in the strategy that we laid out for our growth this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael McCormack of Nomura.\nMichael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Just maybe digging a little deeper on the Wireline enterprise trends. Can you give us some sense for what you're seeing at the customer level as far as demand goes and then also in the competitive environment, the pricing behavior among the bigger carriers? And then on the wholesale side, do you guys anticipate that you can get that revenue stream to something that's more flattish over time given the changes you've made? And then I guess, lastly, on the cash flow side, Fran, what should we be thinking about -- it's probably a little early to be discussing this, but the employee retirement benefits on a going-forward basis and then deferred taxes given bonus depreciation rolling off?\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, Mike, so on the enterprise side and the trends, I think what we're seeing is we're continuing to see improvement in our trends from an overall business perspective. And obviously with the Terremark acquisition, we've really put a sounding board out there for ourselves in the cloud space, and you saw that we split out that revenue of Terremark, which grew almost 30% year-over-year. So I think that strategy is there. What we're seeing, quite honestly, is a lot of enterprise customers are coming to us and asking us what solutions do we have in order to cut their costs. And obviously, a strategy around cloud is really the pivotal point of how we can cut enterprise cost. Now the major concern they obviously have is around the security of that cloud, and we think that being #1 in security and the portfolio that we have from our Cybertrust acquisition and what we just acquired from Terremark, we really do believe we're second to none in the marketplace as far as security expertise. So I think that is starting to build momentum here on the overall enterprise place and also on a global basis for us. On the wholesale side, as I said, this International Voice you saw this quarter, we declined down to 7.4% from where we were about 11% in the last 2 quarters. I think we'll continue to make progress there as we get back to an apples-to-apples comparison. And as I said before, I'm kind of bullish to had said if these trends continue, I do still think that in the fourth quarter, we could be back on a positive growth for the entire Wireline segment for us. And then, from a cash flow perspective and income tax and all that, that was all built into our forecast for free cash flow. As I said in the first quarter, we were low because of some timing-related issues. We came back to the range I gave, and I'm confident that with the decrease in our capital spend, we will deliver higher cash flow in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJonathan Chaplin - JPMorgan: Two quick questions, if I may. So as you strengthen your operating relationship with Vodafone, can you get all the benefits that there are to extract from that relationship just with this kind of a partnership? Or would there be merits to potentially think about combining these companies at some point in the future? And secondly, just going back to the smartphone question for a second. It looks like your share of the smartphone market is coming in a little weaker than we expected. I'm wondering how much you think AT&T offering a $50 iPhone sort of dampened your capture of the smartphone market. And it sounds like you think with the launch of an iPhone 5 and a strong lineup of devices in the fourth quarter, you should really see your smartphone share accelerate. I just want to see if -- make sure that, that's what you expect.\nLowell McAdam: Okay, so there's a lot in there too, Jonathan. So I don't have a lot more to say on the smartphone versus what I said earlier. I do think it's about a quarter behind what we had talked about in January. So given that the delay of the iPhone 5 is more than a quarter, I think we've actually performed quite well. AT&T is a strong competitor, and they've done a lot of things to be a strong competitor. But I like porting ratios. I like our growth rate versus theirs, so I think what you're see is a result of a very dynamic market. Regarding Vodafone, look, I don't see a combination here. I think that we can do what we need to do. There's -- in our markets, they can do what they need to do. In their markets, we can leverage each other's scale, but I would not send any kind of messages here that something like that's immediately on the horizon. I think we need to show that we can do a good operating partnership here. And Vittorio and I see a ton of opportunities in that particular area, and we'll cross whatever bridges are ahead of us when we get to them.\nOperator: Our last question will come from James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital.\nJames Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital: Two quick, if I could, one on Wireless. Are you expecting to see any churn impact from launching a situated pricing as customers become loathe to give that up by moving to another carrier? And secondly, can you talk through a little bit about what margin impact you're seeing from the growth of FiOS both leveraging the existing infrastructure regarding revenue and offsetting the higher operating costs associated with a larger portion of revenue coming from video?\nLowell McAdam: James, let me take the question on tiered pricing, and then Fran can come back and talk about the margins. In my view is that tiered pricing is like gravity. The industry has to get there because there is not unlimited spectrum. And when you look at the utility of the devices that we offer and the video demand that is going to be hitting the devices, it's inevitable. Now each carrier will be in a slightly different position because of their spectrum holdings and their capacity on their networks. So I think over time, there may be some that hold out longer with unlimited, and I wouldn't be surprised if unlimited comes back in and out from a promotional perspective for carriers to balance growth. But in my view, it is -- as I said, like it's inevitable. So do I expect to see some churn impacts? Sure. There will be some users that are very high users that will want to move between carriers to find whatever opportunities they can to continue that. But our strength has always been the best network and the best customer service, and at 2 gigs, well over 95% of our customers are underneath that demand. So I don't think there will be tremendous disruption.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, and then, James, on the FiOS margin, what I will say is that we will continue to make improvements operationally in the FiOS, whether it be on the capital cost of passing a home and a capital cost of connecting the home. And then operationally, we are still performing very, very well compared to core especially around repair and maintenance because the FiOS network operates pretty efficiently. So I think overall, what I will disclose is that FiOS margins continue to improve. I think it's based on 2 things. One is we are very concentrated on the top line growth of our revenue per customer. We have launched Flex View. We've re-bundled where you can build your own bundle now, and we're seeing some nice uptick in people varying whether they want higher speed or less bundling in TV packages and now also with our forthcoming release of our connected home product around security and energy monitoring and electricity and all. So I think it's twofold. It's the operational cost efficiency and building the top line growth of FiOS.\nLowell McAdam: Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Brad, that concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran Shammo.\nFrancis Shammo: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. At our investor meeting in late January, we talked about our 2011 priorities, our strong focus on business plan execution and translating revenue opportunities into profitable growth and shareowner value. In looking at our first quarter results, I'd say we are off to a very strong start. Our Wireless business performed extremely well, further solidifying our leadership position in the industry. Our 4G LTE network deployment is going very well, and our network performance has exceeded even our own very high expectations. In one independent test after another, our network's ability to deliver video and data, with exceptional speed and performance, has been unmatched. Possibly even more impressive is the speed with which products and services are being developed for LTE. Through our LTE rollout, we have positioned ourselves on the leading edge of a whole new phase of Wireless market development.  Our first quarter Wireless results once again demonstrate our ability to effectively manage growth and sustain profitability. We had a very strong quarter of device sales, with 906,000 retail postpaid customer net additions. In a period of less than eight weeks, we activated 2.2 million iPhones and in two weeks, we activated more than 260,000 of our first 4G LTE smartphone, the HTC ThunderBolt, at the premium price of $249.99. In addition, we added about 250,000 4G Internet devices to our retail postpaid base in the quarter, and quickly sold out iPad 2 tablets in early March. So we built good momentum throughout the quarter. Our Wireless service EBITDA margin of 43.7% is a solid result, once again demonstrates our ability to effectively manage the customer acquisition and retention costs associated with gaining market share and increasing smartphone penetration, while sustaining our industry-leading profitable growth profile going forward. In Wireline, our first quarter results showed continued improvement on the top line, with sequential EBITDA margin expansion for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our improved year-over-year performance was driven by continued strength in FiOS and lower line loss rates, resulting in consumer revenue growth of 1.9%, as well as accelerated growth of 12.8% in Enterprise Strategic Services revenue. In terms of cost management, while the first quarter had some seasonal pressures, we did realize the cost benefits of our 16,000 workforce reductions from last year. On the strategic front, we closed the Terremark acquisition on April 11, and significantly improved our competitive position in the rapidly evolving managed hosting and cloud services space.  With these highlights as a backdrop, let's begin a more detailed review of the quarter on Slide 4, starting with a look at consolidated results. Consolidated revenue growth in the first quarter accelerated to 5.3% year-over-year, up sharply from 2.3% growth in the fourth quarter. Total revenue growth in Wireless increased to 10.2%. And while much of this growth was driven by equipment sales in this quarter, we do expect to see future benefit from these sales in subsequent quarters in terms of higher recurring revenue streams. So top line growth is what we expected, and we were on track to meet our full-year revenue guidance of between 4% and 8% annual growth. Our consolidated EBITDA for the first quarter totaled $8.5 billion, up 3.8% year-over-year. The 31.4% EBITDA margin is down about 50 basis points from a year ago, primarily the result of the higher acquisition and retention costs in Wireless. Again, our expectation is for solid margin performance throughout the year, with some fluctuation quarters featuring highly successful new device launches. In terms of earnings, we reported $0.51 for the quarter without any non-operational or special items to point out. This compares with $0.48 in the first quarter a year ago, after adjustments for the impact of divested operations and non-operational charges in that period. With our 4G deployment well underway, our capitalized interest will be significantly lower this year. As a result, Wireless interest expense will reflect about $150 million for each quarter this year. In terms of income taxes, the effective income tax rate attributable to Verizon for the first quarter was 30%. For the full year 2011, we are anticipating an effective tax rate to be in a range consistent with the past three quarters, post the Frontier and Alltel divestitures. Both of these items were fully contemplated in the overall earnings guidance we provided in January. With first quarter growth of 6.3%, we are on track to meet our stated objective of 5% to 8% growth off an adjusted 2010 base of $2.08 per share. Let's turn to cash flow and capital spending on the next slide. In addition to the higher capital spending this quarter, cash flows from operations were impacted by higher acquisition and retention costs in Wireless due to the iPhone in the first quarter funding of our full-year pension obligation, which was $392 million. In addition, the first half of last year included cash flows from the divested properties. In terms of free cash flow, we generated $672 million in the first quarter. And although this is lower than our recent trend, our cash flow outlook for the year remains very strong. Many of the cash flows were timing, and this quarter did not impact our cash management planning for the year. I would also say that there is no change in our thinking with regard to the timing of a Verizon Wireless dividend to its parent companies, which we believe will begin in 2012.  In the first quarter, total CapEx was $4.4 billion, of which $2.7 billion was Wireless. While we expect overall capital spending in 2011 to be essentially flat compared to 2010, we have started the year more aggressively in Wireless, spending a bit more early in the year on 4G LTE, consistent with our overall deployment plans, and continuing to add growth capacity to our 3G network. Looking forward, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE footprint, and invest in necessary capital in 3G to stay ahead of the data demand curve. Wireline capital of $1.5 billion was down 6.4% year-over-year. I would point out that we started last year in a very conservative manner, prudently spending only $3.4 billion in the first quarter, given the higher level of economic uncertainty at that time. In 2011, we will be very disciplined in the terms of overall capital spending, matching our spending with growth opportunities. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the quarter with net debt of $47.2 billion, and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of about 1.4x. On Slide 6, we've displayed first quarter revenues for each of the last three years, which is a good illustration of the transformation and growth of our revenue base. At our investor meeting in January, we talked about this changing revenue mix, and how we've organized ourselves around the growth markets of the future based on a foundation of superior, high-IQ networks that provide the platforms for innovation that we think are unmatched in our industry. Today, 77% of our revenues are in higher growth areas, a sharp increase over the course of the last two years. As we look forward, we are big believers that our high-IQ networks give us a strong, strategic position, and put us at the center of the trends that are driving growth in our industry. In all these strategic areas with our continued emphasis on advancing the deployment of our 4G LTE network in Wireless, with our all-fiber network in mass markets and through our ever-improving global and cloud computing capabilities for Enterprise customers, we are well-positioned to drive higher top line growth. Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. As I said earlier, our Wireless business had a very impressive quarter, with growth in retail customers and ARPU driving service revenue growth and profitability. Total revenue grew to $16.9 billion in the quarter, up 10.2% year-over-year, with total service revenue up 6.3%, with the majority of our device sales occurring in the back half of the first quarter. We are expecting to see higher service revenue growth in the second quarter. In terms of retail postpaid ARPU growth, while we reported year-over-year growth of 2.2% in the first quarter, the month of March was 2.8% higher than last year, which is a good indication of increased revenue and ARPU growth in the second quarter. In terms of new connections, we added a total of 1.8 million this quarter, with 906,000 net retail postpaid customers, and 897,000 wholesale and other connections, including machine-to-machine. While our focus continues to be very much on the retail postpaid market, which continues to be the vast majority of our customer base, we are also broadening our portfolio of machine-to-machine connections in a number of areas: vehicle tracking, meter reading and alarm monitoring, to name a few. And we expect this to be an area of growth for us. We generated $6.3 billion of EBITDA in the first quarter, up 1.7% year-over-year. And while growth in this quarter was impacted by acquisition and retention cost, our service EBITDA margin of 43.7% remains industry leading. We believe that our Wireless EBITDA margins, while they may fluctuate in a given quarter related to successful device introductions, will end up in the mid-40% range for the year. The incremental recurring revenue from smartphone and 4G device sales will help to mitigate the higher acquisition and retention costs. In addition, as I noted in January, we have also identified more than $1 billion in cost saving opportunities in Wireless this year. I am confident that our Wireless team will meet this challenge, and achieve these savings. Let's take a closer look at data growth and device sales on Slide 8. Total data revenue grew $1 billion or 22.3% year-over-year, and now represents 38% of total service revenue. A key driver of data growth in 2011 will be the increased penetration of smartphones in our retail postpaid phone base. To that end, we made good progress, ending the quarter with penetration of 32%. Roughly 60% of all phones sold in the quarter were smartphones, up from 36% just one year ago. 65% of all smartphone sales were new to the category, meaning they were existing customers with feature phones or new Verizon customers. With regard to the iPhone, specifically, 48% of upgrades were new to the smartphone category, meaning, the $30 monthly data plan is incremental revenue. About 22% of our iPhone activations represent new Verizon customers. In terms of 4G LTE, we've seen strong demand for the HTC ThunderBolt and for the PC Cards. On March 29, we introduced our first 4G mobile hotspot device and this past Monday, we announced the availability of our second one. We think these 4G mobile hotspots will be very popular with customers, as they essentially allow any WiFi-enabled device to function as a 4G LTE networked device. We expect demand for our 4G LTE products to strengthen as more smartphones, tablets and hotspots are added to our device portfolio. This includes the recent launch of the Novatel and Samsung mobile hotspots, as well as the addition of new 4G LTE smartphones in April, May and beyond. Clearly, our LTE network performance, our continued build-out, and the successful early product launches are having a very positive impact on the development and strength of the entire LTE ecosystem. As customer acceptance and enthusiasm for smartphones, tablets and all kinds of connected devices gains momentum and becomes more integral to the people's personal and work life, innovation will drive this entire category and expand the overall market. With regard to the further expansion of our LTE footprint, we announced 38 markets in our initial launch in December, covering about 110 million PoPs [Point-of-Presence]. Since then, we've announced more than 100 additional markets in places like Detroit, Memphis, Milwaukee, Louisville, Minneapolis, Sacramento and Honolulu, to name just a few. By the end of the year, we plan to be in about 175 markets, covering more than 185 million PoPs.  Let's take a closer look at ARPU next on Slide 9. Throughout last year, we saw accelerating postpaid ARPU growth, starting with 0.6% year-over-year growth in the first quarter, and steadily ramping to 2.5% growth in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2011, retail postpaid ARPU growth was 2.2%. We attribute this to a few factors, but most notably to late sales in the early part of the quarter in anticipation of the iPhone 4 debut on our network in February. As I said earlier, with much stronger device sales from that point forward, our exit rate for ARPU growth heading into the second quarter was much higher at 2.8%. Data revenue continues to be sourced primarily from web and email services, which increased to $3.2 billion this quarter, up more than 38% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 1/3 of data revenue, is still showing growth, up 7% on a year-over-year basis.  At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 6.1 million Internet devices in our postpaid base, with 364,000 net adds in the first quarter, driven by MiFi devices and 4G PC Cards. As we would expect, our churn metrics for this quarter were excellent. Our retail postpaid churn was 1.01%, improving by four basis points year-over-year. We are encouraged by the strong demand exiting the quarter, and the positive implications for increased revenue and ARPU. You can expect us to effectively deliver both growth and profitability, with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market, increasing the penetration of smartphones, and selling more Internet devices, which will drive continued data revenue growth.  Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 10. As I said earlier, we are seeing an improvement in revenue trends. The 2.2% year-over-year decline in the first quarter is 60 basis points better than the 2.8% decline last quarter. And if we exclude the effects of the international wholesale pricing change, total Wireline revenues were down 0.7% year-over-year. On the consumer side, our FiOS broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS now accounts for 54% of consumer revenue, up from 45% a year ago. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 23.7% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU is more than $146. On the Global Enterprise side, we had positive year-over-year growth, driven by strong strategic services growth of 12.8%. As with FiOS in the consumer market, strategic services are transforming our revenue mix, now representing 46% of total Enterprise. Within this category, advanced services like Managed Network Solutions, Contact Center Solutions, IP Communications and our cloud offerings, are growing very nicely.  From a profitability perspective, segment EBITDA increased $211 million or 9.7%, resulting in a 250 basis point year-over-year improvement in our EBITDA margin to 23.6%. The main reason behind the improvement was our workforce reduction initiatives in 2010, which helped reduce our overall cost of labor. Sequentially, we had a fourth consecutive quarter of EBITDA margin improvement, with an increase of 10 basis points to 23.6%. We achieved this through a combination of revenue stabilization and effective cost management. As the typical first quarter, our cost pressures were offset by the effect of the workforce reductions. Our goal is to achieve margin expansions in 2011 through continuous improvement throughout the year. And while it is unlikely that our workforce reductions in 2011 will come close to what we experienced last year, our focus on reducing our cost structure will be vigilant. Let's take a closer look at the mass markets on Slide 11. Within the mass markets category, consumer revenue of $3.4 billion grew 1.9% versus last year. Consumer ARPU grew to $90.55, an increase of 10.5% from a year ago. The continued penetration of our broadband and video products have increased the scale of our FiOS platform, and is now significant enough to more than offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. We had another solid quarter of customer growth in FiOS TV, adding 192,000 subscribers for a total of 3.7 million TV customers. Our FiOS TV penetration at the end of the quarter was 29%. On the broadband side, we added 207,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the quarter. Our FiOS Internet customer base increased to 4.3 million, representing 33% penetration of homes open for sale. By adding in our 4.2 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.5 million broadband connections. This reflects an overall increase of 98,000 broadband connections, which marks our best sequential growth since the second quarter of 2009. As I have noted in the past, our customer satisfaction ratings are very high, and our churn rates are very low. Our renewed focus on driving penetration in existing markets has been effective, and we're pleased with the overall progress in FiOS. We were off to a good start this year, and our pipeline for TV services are 43% year-over-year.  Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 12. While we are seeing some signs of improvement, revenues in the business market continue to be challenged by economic pressures. Global Enterprise revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Strategic Services drove the year-over-year improvement, led by a very strong growth in Advanced Services, such as Managed Network, Call Center, IP Communications, and our cloud offerings. As I've said, this category of services is becoming a larger part of our revenues, and we are incenting our sales force to sell these solutions to our Enterprise customers.  As we experienced last quarter, the absolute dollar growth in Strategic Services outpaced the dollar decline in core Enterprise Services. In Global Wholesale, revenues declined 11.2% year-over-year. As we've discussed, our route rationalization strategy has resulted in a substantial decline in International Voice revenue, worth $162 million this quarter on a year-over-year basis. Since these price changes were initiated in mid-2010, I'd say we have a few more quarters to work through before the comparative impact of these actions moderates. Absent these effects, first quarter Global Wholesale revenues declined 5% year-over-year. This decline is primarily in Domestic Voice, where we continue to experience secular pressures and lower usage volumes. I will wrap up here with the chart we used at our investor meeting in January, showing the keys to success in terms of executing our business model. We had a solid first quarter and a quality start to the year. Our early performance gives us great confidence that we are on track to meet our financial objectives, and continue to position ourselves for future growth and profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve built great momentum, and have entered the second quarter in very good shape. We're seeing continued demand for our Apple products and 4G LTE devices with more smartphones, tablets, and Internet devices coming to market shortly. As such, we expect Service revenue growth, and ARPU accretion to accelerate with each quarter this year. Our FiOS customer pipeline is very healthy, and we are very excited to add Terremark, one of the premier assets in hosting and cloud services to our portfolio of global assets and capabilities, enhancing our competitive position around the cloud opportunity, and contributing to our growth. I'll stop here and turn it back to John, so we can open up the call to your questions.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning. First, on postpaid ARPU. Fran, you gave some helpful commentary on the exit rates at 2.8% in March. I guess what that implies, though, is that the entry rates in January were probably roughly 1.5% growth, which is a step down from the fourth quarter rates, and it seemed to imply to me that the 4G laptop cards you launched in December, I guess it\u2019s logical that you would've over indexed sales here early in the quarter, which generally carry a little bit lower ARPU, and I'm wondering if you can offer granularity. Is that what happened? Just trying to put a finer point on sort of this progress through the quarter you had on ARPU. And the second question on Wireless margins. You talked about lumpiness in margins attached to handset launches, obviously, two big launches in the quarter with iPhone and ThunderBolt, but it was only a partial quarter for both. So does that mean that in 2Q, you'd expect a bit of incremental margin dilution, as we get a full quarter of those devices? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Thank you, Jason. Okay, so let's address the ARPU first. So if you look at what we did, we came out of December at 2.5%, as I said in the previous comment. We had a very soft January. We continued to maintain our upgrades. If you recall, when we launched the iPhone initially, we had a week of just upgrades to our current base, which we felt was important to show our loyalty to our customers, who stayed with us, even though we didn't have the iPhone. And then we launched the iPhone, and we had people who were waiting for that device. So again, the first half of the quarter was soft. There was really no incremental ARPU, if you will, in that first half, given that sales were low and upgrades continued. But as we launched the iPhone, and if you think about it, it was only a half a quarter, but it's also important to realize that when we launched the iPhone, initially, we only launched it through our direct channel, and a couple major retailers. And then in the beginning of March, we launched it to the rest of our national retailers, and some of our regional retailers, and we really weren't 100% out there with the distribution until mid-March. The second piece is, is that we only had two weeks of sales worth on the LTE device on smartphones. And then finally, we just launched the 4G device at the last day of the month. So I think if you look at all of this and you look at the pro rata of access on these devices, that's why we only generated 2.2% of growth, but we accelerated to 2.8%. And as we said, we think that this will just continue to accelerate as the year goes on, as we launch these initial devices. Now getting into your margin comment, no, I don't think that you'll see a decline in the second quarter. The fluctuation, I believe, will come when a new device from Apple is launched, whenever that may be, and that we will be, on the first time, in equal footing with our competitors on a new phone hitting the market, which will also be a global device. So I think there will be some fluctuations when that happens, but we don't anticipate any fluctuation in the second quarter.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks, Fran.\nFrancis Shammo: Thank you, Jason.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, Thanks, guys. Quick question on the Wireless, is 50% smartphone penetration still the target? Because I think it implies some accelerating penetration gains, which would also support your view on the improvements in ARPU. And then secondly on the Wireline side, you showed some progress there, and I guess you'll show some more progress when you lap the changes in the wholesale pricing. Is it possible that we see some Wireline growth by the end of the year in Wireline?\nFrancis Shammo: Thanks, John. So first off, on the 50% penetration, yes, we still are very confident in the 50%. And let me just be clear here because at the end of December, we labeled that we were at 26% penetration, but we changed the way we were calculating our penetration. So I want to make sure everybody's clear. We were kind of -- we were doing a different calculation than the rest of the industry, so we changed to equal the rest of the industry, so that we had an apples-to-apples comparison. So if you look at the 26% we disclosed in December, it really was 28%. Now we ended this quarter at 32%. This, I believe, is going to accelerate as we continue to launch, and have a full month of Apple on the decks. Also, with the LTE launches, as you know, we only had two weeks of our first HTC handset. We are coming out with our Samsung handset very shortly here, and then LG will be following. So we will have up to three devices launched by the second quarter. So again, that's going to accelerate the growth. And yes, we are very confident that we'll hit the 50% penetration. And then on the Wireline side of the house, I think as we continue here, we are confident that we can continue to expand the EBITDA margin in Wireline. Obviously, there is a lot of cost reduction that has to take place. We continue to work out and look at the entire logistics ecosystem. We are continuing to reduce real estate. Last year, we reduced over $7 million, and our target is equal for this year. We have a whole garage study being taking place, and we are closing garages and consolidating on that. So as you look at that continued margin, I think that's one piece of it. But as you mentioned, as we work ourselves out of the International Voice decline year-over-year, and I think that will happen entering into the third quarter. If the economy starts to stimulate a bit, and we continue to obviously penetrate on the FiOS side, I think there is a good point where we could actually see some top line growth out of the Wireline segment.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. Thanks, Fran.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much. You talked about closing the Terremark transaction, Fran. Are you able to give us any color on sort of headline trends for Q1 for Terremark? And then I think in the past, in March, you talked about unlimited pricing, reviewing that on your new devices in the summer timeframe. Perhaps, you could give us an update on that? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Thank you, Simon. So on Terremark, we closed the transaction on April 11. We'll have our first full quarter here in the second quarter. Terremark continued to grow at their steady pace of 20% through the first quarter. We believe that, that will continue into the second quarter and obviously, Bob Toohey and his team on the business side, have a lot of integration activity going on with Manny and his team, and we're going to hit the streets strong with an offer here, a collaborative offer between the former Verizon business and the Terremark assets. So I think we're off to a good start there. On the unlimited pricing, we are going to be going to a tier pricing in midsummer this year. That is a definite, and you will hear more of that as we get there. But yes, we will be going to a tiered pricing for both 3G and 4G devices.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Simon.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc: Thanks. One question and just a couple of housekeeping things. On the question, can you talk a little bit more about the business markets, particularly, what you're seeing in the small and medium end of the market? And are you seeing any more competition in cable there? And then from a housekeeping perspective, can you just give us the Wireless replacement rates, device replacement rates during the quarter for postpaid, and where the Wireless business ended on a net debt basis for the quarter? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay. Thanks, Mike. So on the -- first off, on the SMB, I think what we'll see is, first, if you look at on the Wireline side of the house and the overlap that we have there, obviously, we are at a disadvantage when you think about the DSL and the Voice strategy that we have on the former copper plant. We're at a disadvantage to cable in that area. But if you look at our FiOS and where we have passed the PRAM [Parallel Random Access Machine] and actually connected to PRAM in small business, our growth rate there is 37% year-over-year. So there is a difference between what market on the overlap of the Wireline assets we're talking about. So I think that's important to note. But from an overall perspective, I think we're flat. We've made some improvement year-over-year, but I will tell you, I'm not happy with the progress in the small-business arena, and Bobbie Mudge and his team are attacking that. But even within the Bob Toohey organization and Verizon business outside of the Wireline footprint, with the Terremark acquisition, I think we have some unique offers that we can now make to the small business arena around cloud, and I think that will help some of the offset of the former MCI mass markets, which continues to decline. From a housekeeping perspective, on net debt from an overall perspective on net debt, we ended the quarter, as I said, at $47.2 billion, and Wireless ended at about around $12 billion.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc: Great. Thanks. And then just the Wireless device replacement rate for postpaid, if you have that for the quarter, that would be great too.\nFrancis Shammo: Now Michael, just to clarify, when you say replacements rate, you mean upgrades?\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc: Yes.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay. So just a couple things around that. The other one point I want to make on the debt side of the house is that we have about, as I said, we have a $4 billion dollars maturity coming up here in May that will come out of Wireless. So there's a maturity of about $4 billion. So that will take the net debt down on the Wireless side as well. Then on the upgrade side of the house, as we said, that 60% of our sales were smartphones altogether. And as I said before, in January, I thought there was a major opportunity for us because our featured base as part of our postpaid base was significantly higher, and this was an area where we thought that we could make some good inroads into upgrading our feature phone base into a smartphone. This quarter, 56% of our upgrades in total, and as you see from our release, we did about 3% a quarter so -- 3% a month, so it was about 9% for the quarter. So 56% of them were upgrades of feature phones or multimedia phones to our smartphones. So when you think about that, if you look at a feature phone, which has no data plan today, that's an incremental $30 of ARPU, and on our multimedia, they had a $10 feature plan, which now we get an incremental $20 of ARPU. So I think from that perspective, I do believe that we still have some very good inroads here from our feature phone perspective going forward. We still have 62% of our base that are still on feature phones. And then on the 4G side of the house, if you look at the adds that we did, 35% of them were new to category. And when I say that, they were also feature phones who upgraded into that. Now that's part of the 56% that I talked before. But just specifically, on the 4G device, 35% of them were upgrades.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG: Thanks for taking the question, and I really appreciate all the color around the iPhone, the ThunderBolt. So I'm just going to ask for a bit more. If we just assume that you had a very strong launch around the iPhone, particularly to the existing customers, it kind of looks like as you exited the quarter, both devices might have been selling at about the same pace, so I'm wondering if that's a reasonable conclusion here. And then you had mentioned how the iPhone didn't launch with full distribution, but that's expanded. Is that the same approach you're taking with your LTE devices, or are you actually putting them in all of your channels on day one?\nFrancis Shammo: Yes, so Brett, let me address a couple of that. So on the iPhone launch, we were cautious because we were not sure, obviously, of the demand that was there for the phone, and we wanted to monitor the supply and the demand so that we did not run into a backlog situation. From an HTC perspective, we are launching that across the board. So it is not a similar effect there. Now if you look at the iPhone, 78% of the iPhone were upgrades, and 22% of those iPhones were new to our base. So if you do the math there, you can look at -- the iPhone dropped right down into our net adds for the quarter. And then if you look at 4G and you add that in, 54% of our net adds were consistent with both the iPhone launch and the HTC launch. So 54% of our net adds came from those two devices alone. So I think that from a pace perspective, we are very, very pleased with the HTC handset launch. You have seen, probably, some of the articles I have seen, where people have tested it. This is a true 4G device. You can put as much lipstick on 3 to make it a 4, but this is truly a 4G device, with the speeds of 4G, and I think people are impressed, and people will make their decisions. So out of the gate, we're very happy with the volume, and I think that this will just continue as we continue to launch more 4G smartphone devices coming here in the next few weeks.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG: So just one quick follow-up here, I mean, you're now selling the most popular 3G smartphone on the market in the iPhone. You're selling the most popular 4G smartphone on the market. I know it's early days, but are you seeing anything meaningfully different in the way people are using the devices?\nFrancis Shammo: Not really. I think that with the 4G speeds, obviously, people are consuming more data. That will be expected, given the video speeds and some of the TV download speeds. But keep in mind, though, that the 4G network is so much more efficient than the 3G network, so even with that incremental usage on 4G, that even at the same price of 3G, the profitability is higher. So it behooves us to move as many people to 4G as we possibly can, and you will see us doing that proactively in certain markets. So from a different standpoint, yes, they're consuming more on 4G than they are in 3G, but we expected that.\nJohn Doherty: All right. Thanks, Brett.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Cusick of JPMC.\nPhilip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Thank you for taking my call. So first, I want to see if you can give a little more detail on some of these things. You talked about the smartphone mix picking up from 60%. Can you give us what the March smartphone mix might've been as you saw that ARPU acceleration?\nFrancis Shammo: Phil, I don't have that detail. I just had it for the quarter.\nPhilip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then just following up on Brett's as well, the 4G data usage, you said, is higher. Can you give us an idea of what that is? Are you disclosing [ph] at this time?\nFrancis Shammo: At this point, we're not going to disclose the usage on 4G. It's really way too early to deal with that because as you know, as people get a initial handset, they initially download a lot of applications, so usage tends to be higher than the normal average. And we've only been at this HTC handset for 2 weeks, so I think it's premature to release anything like that.\nPhilip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. I'll try one more swing, and then maybe I'll be out. So you talked about the iPhone being a global device. When that launches, do you anticipate that being a 4G device and sort of being at par in terms of speeds with your other 4G?\nFrancis Shammo: Yes, I can't answer for Apple's product launch, to be honest with you. All I know is it will be a global device. At that point, I think we'll have to go to Apple to find out exactly what that device will have.\nJohn Doherty: Nice try, Phil.\nPhilip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co: All right. I tried. Thanks a lot, Fran.\nFrancis Shammo: All right. Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities.  [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Mike McCormack, Nomura Securities.\nMichael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Yes, just a couple of quick questions. First, not to beat the ARPU thing to death here, but you guys have identified, obviously, some back-end loading of the smartphones, and that's -- I think that's good color. But thinking about ARPU growth, can you sort of identify the offsets, which might be coming in the form of voice pressure from family share roaming. And then how should we think about data devices like tablets and sticks and cards and stuff like that, that may carry a lower overall ARPU, which could sort of have an impact on the growth rate, but obviously, driving some decent adds. And then secondly, and it might be premature, but thinking about the iPhone guidance for the year based on 11 million, the 2.2 million tracking a bit lower, not surprising given a partial quarter, but it's also the launch quarter. So just trying to figure out what's your thought processes there? You, obviously, were anticipating a refresh at some point during the year that obviously could boost that as well, but just some thoughts around that would be great.\nFrancis Shammo: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. So from an ARPU's perspective, from a Voice ARPU perspective, we are, obviously, seeing a decline there, but it is a slowing decline year-over-year. So yes, that is putting pressure on us, but it is putting a pressure on us at a slower rate, and we view that as that will continue into the future. Also, from a Voice ARPU perspective, as we launch the iPhone, I guess I would be remiss to say that the call quality on the iPhone has been spectacular on the 3G CDMA network. And obviously, we think that our Voice will continue to slow as we add more iPhones, and people realize the quality of the voice network and the data network there. So I think that'll be fine. From a tablet and a broadband access device perspective, there is some small dilution going on from the old price plans to the new price plans, but we don't see that as being a drag to the overall ARPU, as we continue to penetrate into the tablet scenario, into the 4G MiFi devices, and the usage that the MiFi devices will bring, and the tiered pricing that we already have related to our data products. So I don't see that as being a major issue going forward. And as far as the 2.2 million in the first quarter and the 11 million, overall, we're sticking with our 11 million view for our guidance purposes.\nMichael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Great. Thanks, Fran. I appreciate it.\nFrancis Shammo: Thank you, Mike.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDavid Barden: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Just two, if I could, maybe, Fran, just starting with the debt raise recently this past quarter, and kind of bulking up on the balance sheet, both kind of $9 billion-or-so, with $7 billion going into cash. Obviously, we've got the Terremark deal cash going out the door, but is this cash that we put on the balance sheet really about trying to avoid the necessity of upstreaming dividends or maintaining leverage at the Verizon Wireless business? Because I did notice that you guys kind of called out that specifically in the call today, that you didn't want to have to do anything on the dividend until next year. But because you're not, you had to go into the markets and raise this money and put cash on the balance sheet. I'm just wondering if you could kind of talk for your thinking there. And I think the second question, if I could, is just maybe more strategically, thinking about the industry consolidation. I think you guys have come out as fairly neutral on AT&T's prospective acquisition of T-Mobile. With the caveat, as long as it doesn't lead towards incremental regulation of the industry, could you talk a little bit about what kinds of regulations you think would be the kinds of regulations that would get you up off the bench to kind of come in and oppose this deal? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay. Thank you, David. So first, on the debt side of the house, yes, we actually went out into the market, because we have some debt maturities, both within corporate and Wireline this year, that needed to be refinanced, and we initially did it. The interest rates were so well, we took advantage of the interest rates, and raised it to $6.25 billion. We have about $2 billion worth of maturities coming in the back half of the year. We had a $500 million refinancing that took place in the first quarter. We also wanted to re [indiscernible] finance some of our CP paper, commercial paper, so we did that as well. And due to the lucrativeness of the interest rates we had, we also decided to pre-fund our pension plan of $400 million, both to take effect of the interest rate and the arbitrage on that, compared to the return that, that $400 million we'd get in the pension plan, that would help us alleviate some of our future cash flow obligations into the plan. So this really was all-around just the refinancing and rebalancing of our balance sheet, and just for general other observations. And as you said, to pay for the Terremark, and also to refinance the Terremark debt. And then from an AT&T and a T-Mobile merger perspective, I guess the comment I would have is we have to let that go through due process with the federal government. And we'll sit and wait and see. Obviously, we will then take a view of -- if it's a market-based condition merger, we will be fine with that. If it's a regulatory merger, then we'll have a harder time with it. Now as far as what may have been a little bit off here is, I'm not going to go into what types of things we may object to but obviously, we are very strong on where we stand with net neutrality. We are very strong where we stand with data roaming, and the positions that the FCC have recently taken there, and we will not stand by if there are certain regulations put on us that we have to deliver certain things at a fixed price that's set by a regulatory arm that has no authority over that regulation of price. So we'll sit back, let it go through its due process, and then we'll see what happens.\nDavid Barden: All right, guys. Thanks.\nJohn Doherty: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thanks, guys. Two broader questions. Fran, on the Managed Services front, I know it's early in the process here, but do you find yourself bumping up against more some of the traditional IT outsourcers in that market? And do you have the capabilities you need in managed services to at this point, or do you need more acquisitions? And then secondly, on the smartphone side, could you talk about, ultimately, what you'd like to see in terms of number of suppliers on the different platforms and maybe, market share platform? And related to this, the subsidies for handsets, do you think we're at peak run rates here, and they can start to decline, or do you think we'll see handset subsidies on the smartphones increase for awhile? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay. Thanks, Tim. So on the Managed Services side, I think that we have the portfolio of assets that we need to be very successful in this piece of the business, and I think we've shown that with some of the wins that we have publicly stated here in the past. And you're absolutely right, we are actually entering into a market where we're competing with many different players, depending upon where you are in the globe. Especially here in the U.S., we go up against all of the integrators, and some of the other service providers. But outside the globe, we hit on a bunch of different players like Tata and InfoSystems, and people like that. So it depends where you are in the globe, but we think we\u2019re very well-positioned with our portfolio. And we've shown this with our strategic services growth of 12.8%. Some of the growth this quarter and the reason it jumped up was driven by our Managed Services business. So I think we're starting to really gain new ground here. We have proven ourselves with some of the major undertakings that we've taken with some of our announced deals with Matsui and JetBlue, and others. So I think we've got a good stance, and I don't think we need to do any more major acquisitions in this portfolio. As far as the smartphone side of the house and subsidies, I think, first, we're charging a premium on the 4G smartphone, so the subsidy, obviously, there is less than others, but we'll have to see how the market goes. And I would assume that this market will mature this similar that the feature phone market matured over the years, where as more players become into the marketplace, and we have new entrants, like maybe a Huawei, down the road, there will be put pressure on the other manufacturers to get more efficient and reduce price, and then that will help our subsidy go. So I think the maturity of the market and the ecosystem will eventually take care of itself.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse.\nJonathan Chaplin - JPMorgan: Thanks for taking the question. So one question, AT&T gave us one or two of the justifications for the deal, getting access to a lot more spectrum, and increasing their cell site density quickly. I think up to this transaction, they're going to have significant -- 50 megahertz or so more spectrum than you, and a cell site density, which is 25% to 35% more dense than yours as well. Can you talk about how you see your spectrum needs evolving over the course of the next three-to-five years? And what do you think you need to do from a cell site density perspective to keep up with the rapidly growing data demand you're seeing? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So as we\u2019ve said before, we think we're in a very good spectrum position. We think we have the spectrum we need, and we're in a good position until about the year 2015 at this point. And we will continue to keep our eyes open to see where we need to buy spectrum or secure spectrum. But right now, we're in a very, very good position. I'm not going to speak to the competitor. You can ask those questions as to why they did this, and why they needed the spectrum, but I think we're in a very good position.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Fran. Thanks to all of the participants that joined us this morning. And with that, Brad, let me hand it back to you to conclude the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I am John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our website. I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. I would also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I would like to cover a few items upfront. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.56 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $232 million or $0.08 per share for non-operational charges related to patent litigation settlements with TiVo and ActiveVideo. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.64 in the third quarter, up 14.3% year-over-year. Through nine months adjusted EPS is $1.87, an increase of 14.7% from last year. Discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of non operational items. As we have previously indicated, we are no longer reporting average revenue per unit or ARPU for wireless postpaid devices, instead, we are disclosing average revenue per account or ARPA which we believe is a more meaningful metric going forward given our new shared data pricing plans. Earlier this month, we filed a Form 8-K which disclosed 10 quarters of historical information for the following retail postpaid metrics; the number of accounts, the average connections per account and the average revenue per account. This information can also be found on our investor website. It is now part of the wireless selected operating statistics included in our financial and operating information schedules.  With that, I will turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, John. Good morning everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our financial results. We continue to execute our plan well across the entire business. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9% and our strong focus on cost management and improving profitability resulted in solid double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the third consecutive quarter. This sustained operating performance together with disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the overall business. Through the first nine months, we generated $13.4 billion of free cash flow, which is 50% more than last year. The wireless business is setting global benchmarks for performance and we are building significant momentum heading in to the fourth quarter and 2013. Service revenue growth increased to 7.5%, driven by increasing smartphone penetration and greater device adoption, stimulated by the successful and well received introduction of our Share Everything plans. This sustained revenue growth performance, together with our demonstrated ability to effectively manage cost and retain customers, resulted in a record setting EBITDA service margin of 50%, even with our strongest subscriber growth in four years. In Wireline, consumer revenue growth accelerated to 4.6%, a sharp increase from 2.5% in the second quarter, driven by increased FiOS revenue per customer. Enterprise and Wholesale revenues continue to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe. We are confident that our focus on improving long-term profitability through product rationalization and simplification along with process streamlining will prove to be the right decisions as we build a fundamentally stronger business. On September 19th we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new three-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. We believe that this is a fair and balanced agreement that is good for our employees as well as a real positive for the future of the wireline business. I will talk more about the tentative agreement during the wireline segment review. Overall, another strong quarter of performance put solidly on-track to meet our financial objectives for the year. Let\u2019s begin our review with a look at consolidated results on slide four. We sustained our solid consolidated growth trends with positive contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue growth increased at 3.9%. Our operating leverage and strong focus on expense controls drove operating income up 17.9%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $10 billion and our margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially to 34.6%, its highest level in nearly four years. Earnings growth also improved. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, adjusted EPS growth was more than 14% in the third quarter and is up nearly 15% year-to-date. Let\u2019s turn now to cash flow and capital spending on slide five. Our free cash flow increased to $5.6 billion in the quarter, driven by higher cash from operations and continued discipline in our capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of about $260 million compared to last year. Year-to-date, capital spending of $11.3 billion was down about 10%. My expectation is that capital spending for the full year will be lower than the $16.2 billion we incurred in 2011. In addition, we expect our annual CapEx to revenue ratio to decline based on improved revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. In Wireless, CapEx in the third quarter was $2.1 billion which was about $350 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, Wireless capital of $6.1 billion was lower by nearly 16%. CapEx savings this year are due primarily to lower capacity spending on the 3G network. We continue to build and expand the nation\u2019s largest 4G LTE network as more customers choose 4G LTE smartphones and devices, the migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower cost 4G LTE network will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency. Currently, more than 35% of our data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network. In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion in the quarter down a $133 million from last year. Year-to-date, Wireline capital of $4.6 billion was about 3% lower. Our previously announced spectrum transactions all closed during the third quarter representing the net cash outlay of $3.7 billion. In return, we received about 5.9 billion Megahertz POPs of high quality AWS spectrum. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt of $52.8 billion was down $2.4 billion from the end of the last year. Net debt was $43.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.1 times. I would like to spend the next few minutes discussing pension liabilities and funding starting on slide six. Yesterday, after the market close, we announced that we will be transferring approximately $7.5 billion of management retiree pension benefit obligations to Prudential by purchasing a group annuity contract. Prudential will assume the responsibility in making monthly pension payments to approximately 41,000 management retirees. The transfer will not change the amount of the monthly pension benefit received by these retirees or their surviving beneficiaries. Pension obligations relating to active management and union represented employees and retirees are not affected. The transaction will remove about 25% of our outstanding pension liabilities upon closing which we expect to occur in December. Turning to slide seven, this transaction is part of an overall pension de-risking strategy and reduces our exposure to funding and income statement volatility caused by change in investment returns, discount rates and longevity risk. It also allows us to transfer this liability at reasonable economics and avoid certain administrative costs while improving the longer term financial profile of the business. As a result of this transaction, some additional cash funding will be required in 2012 to fully fund the pension obligations being transferred to Prudential and to maintain the funded status of the pension liabilities that will remain with Verizon. In terms of timing, we already made an additional $930 million pension contribution in September. So, on a year-to-date basis we have made $1.8 billion in contributions. In the fourth quarter we expect to make another $1.6 billion cash contribution.  Our revised outlook for pension funding in 2012 is estimated to be $3.4 billion, as compared to the $1.3 billion we estimated at the beginning of the year. While this represents more funding this year, we will have no cash funding requirements for pensions in 2013. Based on our current plan assumptions, we also expect contribution requirements in future years to be lower as a result of this transaction.  Let's now move into the review of the segments starting with wireless on slide 8. Our wireless business had another excellent quarter with accelerating growth in retail post paid connections, better than expected adoption and financial performance of our new Share Everything plans and strong growth in post paid revenue per count or ARPA. Even more impressive is the fact that we achieved a 50% EBITDA service margin, while activating more smartphones than any other quarter in our history, with the exception of the fourth quarter last year.  Total wireless revenues of $19 billion grew 7.3%, and represent 65% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue year-to-date. Retail service revenue grew 7.9% and total service revenue growth was 7.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. As John mentioned, we are disclosing new retail post paid metrics replacing ARPU with ARPA, as well as providing a number of post paid accounts and the average connections per account.  The change in reporting aligned with a strategic intent of our shared data plan, which is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage on our wireless network. Since driving service revenue growth is the key to our business model, the more relevant metric going forward is the amount of revenue that we generate per account.  During the quarter, ARPA grew to more than 145 hours per month, an increase of 6.5%. In only 3 months, 13% of the retail postpaid base adopted Share Everything plans. Adoption is ahead of our expectations and ARPA dilution has been lower. As we're seeing existing customers adding devices, and increasing their data usage allowances. The combination of incremental revenue from new customers, smartphone upgrades, increased devices connecting to our network and higher usage will more than makeup for the effects of the customers initially optimizing their accounts. The voice adoption and data usage will become the primary drivers of service revenue growth for years to come. Lets\u2019 take a closer look at connections growth on slide 9; as we mentioned coming out of the second quarter, our retail postpaid net adds have continued to accelerate. With our strong performance, I am very confident that we continue to gain postpaid market share in the quarter. In addition to our strong device portfolio, network reliability and 4G LTE advantage, the introduction of our Share Everything plans prove to be yet another compelling reason for customers to choose Verizon. During the quarter, we added 1.8 million new retail net connections, with more than 1.5 million postpaid and 228,000 prepaid. We have an industry leading 95.9 million retail connections with approximately 90.4 million postpaid and 5.5 million prepaid. Our 90.4 million postpaid connections represent 34.8 million accounts, with an average of 2.6 connections per account. Before discussing our postpaid results in more detail, let me highlight our retail prepaid performance where we had another strong quarter. Net adds of 228,000 were significantly higher than a year ago and prepaid revenue continue to positively impact retail service revenue growth.  In retail postpaid our 1.5 million net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 888,000 in the second quarter and the highest total we\u2019ve reported in four years. Roughly one-third of these net adds were internet devices, which include USB modems, jetpacks and postpaid tablets. Roughly 95% of our postpaid internet device activations this quarter were 4G LTE, which is very positive from a daily usage perspective and provides additional evidence that our Share Everything plans are stimulating device adoption. As you know, we are the market leader in this space with 8 million internet device connections in our retail postpaid base and more importantly, over half of these are 4G LTE. Our churn metrics continue to be market leading. Retail postpaid churn of 0.91% improved by 3 basis points year-over-year and was up only 7 basis points sequentially in what is typically a seasonally higher quarter. Postpaid gross adds in the quarter were very strong at $4 million, up 27% sequentially and 20% year-over-year; also the highest gross add quarter in four years. The number of customers upgrading devices was slightly less than last quarter, representing 6.8% of our retail postpaid connection space. Next, let\u2019s turn to slide 10 and take a look at smartphones and our progress in 4G LTE. Smartphone penetration increased from just below 50% last quarter to more than 53%, a strong quarter in terms of smartphone adoption. As expected, an increasing majority of postpaid phone sales were smartphones. In the third quarter, we activated 6.8 million smartphones, representing 79% of the total phone category; 3.4 million of these smart phones were android, of which 3 million were 4G LTE. In terms of Apple iPhones, we activated 3.1 million in the quarter, 21% of which were 4G LTE.  Another important point is the improving mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the third quarter, the percent new to Verizon increased to 31% of total activations, a sharp improvement from the 20% t 23% range we have reported in past quarters. This higher gross add mix is recognition of our 4G LTE network advantage since an increasing percentage of our smartphone activations are 4G LTE. In addition within the customer upgrades 44% were buying a smartphone for the first time. In terms of 4G LTE coverage, we are by far the market leader. Our 4G LTE service is currently available in 419 markets, covering more than 250 million POPs, roughly 80% of the US population. As our TV commercial say, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors networks combined. We will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with a goal of having a nationwide foot print similar to our 3G network next year. Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily each and every quarter since we launched service in late 2010. In the third quarter, this increase was more dramatic as 4G LTE smartphone activations increased to 3.7 million from 2.5 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 14.9 million 4G LTE phones and devices in our postpaid base, representing 16.5% of total retail postpaid connections.  Said in another way, 25% of our smartphones and 51% of our internet devices are 4G LTE. Very impressive numbers in a relatively short period of time. However, we expect these percentages to continue to ramp as all new smartphones in our device roadmap will be 4G LTE. Looking ahead, we see a great deal of new product development activity in end to end, particularly in healthcare and energy. We are also collaborating on in innovative video roadmap with the cable companies as part of our technology joint venture. Let\u2019s conclude our wireless review with a discussion about profitability on slide 11. We generated $8.1 billion of EBITDA in the third quarter, an increase of 12.4% and expanded our EBITDA service margin by 100 basis points sequentially to 50%. Again we achieved this record profitability in a quarter in which we reported the highest number of gross and net adds in four years. Simply stated our margin performance is a testament to a demonstrated and consistent ability to execute well in our strategy of achieving both growth and profitability. The combination of sustainable service revenue growth and intense focused on cost management and consistently excellent churn metrics are all contributing factors to our industry leading margin performance. In terms of managing our cost, we will continue to look at any and all opportunities within the business to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. As I previously indicated, we identified $2 billion in cost saving opportunities in wireless this year, and we have already surpassed that target. Let's move to our Wireline segment next, starting with mass markets on slide 12. Mass markets revenue grew 3.8%, due primarily to accelerating growth in the consumer business. Our 4.6% revenue growth was the highest we've seen in 10 years and we are on track to achieve at least a 5% growth rate in the fourth quarter. This growth of course was driven by FiOS, where revenue grew 18% in the third quarter, and now represents about two-thirds of consumer revenue.  The increasing scale of FiOS is driving growth and consumer revenue per month, which increased to nearly $104 in the quarter, up 10.3%. FiOS ARPU is now over $150,000 per month, and about two-thirds of our FiOS consumer customers are triple plays with voice, internet and video services.  In terms of broadband customer growth, we had a 136,000 new FiOS internet additions in the quarter and now have nearly 5.3 million subscribers, representing penetration of 37%. In DSL, we had a net loss of $144,000 which is a bit higher than the last few quarters. Again, our decision to discontinue offering dry loop DSL had a negative impact on gross adds, but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint.  In spite of the lack of net subscriber growth, broadband revenues increased both sequentially and year-over-year driven by our quantum offer and copper-to-fiber migration. In FiOS video, we added about 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to $4.6 million and increasing our penetration to 33%.  In terms of FiOS customer growth, we did experience some seasonality with respect to churn, due in part to an increase in customers moving and also some elasticity related to our price increases. Based on our current sales activity, we are expecting improvement in FiOS customer adds in the fourth quarter, along with our continuing revenue growth trajectory. Within mass markets, we are focused on driving revenue growth, improving operating and capital efficiency and maximizing profitability. Key actions this year included targeted price increases, new differentiated services like FiOS Quantum and our copper-to-fiber migration initiative which is helping to reduce our dependence on copper technology. Through nine months, we have migrated about a 150,000 homes-to-fiber and we are on-track to exceed 200,000 by the end of the year. We have already experienced a greater than 10% improvement in our Trouble Report Rate which is saving on repair costs in these areas. We are also beginning to gain some traction in up-selling new customers with additional FiOS services which will result in additional monthly recurring revenue. We will have more to say going forward with regard to this important initiative including how many homes will we be targeting in 2013. Suffice it to say, that we are pleased with our progress to-date and view the copper-to-fiber migration as an important part of our strategy to reduce the wireline cost structure. Before moving on, I would also add that our residential connection trends continue to improve. During the third quarter, we lost 217,000 retail residential connections representing a 6.3% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 278,000 or 8% at this time last year. Let's move to our enterprise markets next on slide 13. As I said in my overview, our challenge in the enterprise markets is primarily one of secular pressures and global economic conditions which include foreign exchange movements. In addition, as we previously noted, we are making deliberate moves to rationalize and simplify our enterprise solutions product portfolio which is also putting near-term pressure on revenue comparisons. In the third quarter, Global Enterprise was down $39 million sequentially and declined a $140 million or 3.6% compared with year ago. A majority of which were due to intentional actions on our part. This includes the de-emphasis of drop-ship CPE and decommissioning end of life products like ATM, frame relay and IP VPN. Lower CPE sales represented a $139 million of the year-over-year decline. Foreign currency translation also had an unfavorable impact on revenue as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound sterling caused a $40 million dollar decline in the third quarter, compared with a $37 million increase a year ago. We are confident that our product rationalization and streamlining initiatives will fundamentally strengthen the business and improve our operating efficiency. We are also taking actions to enhance our network, facilities and overall end-to-end service provisioning in order to put the business in a stronger position to benefit when the global economy picks up. These strategic and operational activities are creating some margin pressure in the near-term, and will result in improved profitability in 2013. Strategic Services, which comprised 53% of Global Enterprise revenue totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%, while we continue to perform relatively well in these services. International and FX continue to have an adverse effect on growth. Domestically, we are seeing new contracts and investment decisions being delayed as enterprise CIOs continue to be cautious with regard to uncertainties involving the election outcome, the pending fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other policy changes that may take place. Collectively, these uncertainties have created a wait-and-see approach that is impacting new business. We believe that a better understanding of these impacts will help companies make decisions about their capital commitments and we are hopeful that enterprises renew their investing activities in 2013. During this period, Verizon Enterprise Solutions continues to strengthen its competitive position in higher growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. In late July, we completed the acquisition of Hughes Telematics, which will expand and accelerate our capabilities in advanced automotive, lead telematics and many other machine-to-machine services. Moving next to Global Wholesale, revenues in the third quarter declined $45 million sequentially and $181 million or 9.2% year-over-year due primarily to continued declines in transport services. We are taking the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space, as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s. Let\u2019s move on to slide 14 next, to summarize wireline. From a topline perspective, the overall picture is mixed, with some very encouraging signs in the consumer market, while we continue to manage through secular and cynical challenges in Enterprise and Wholesale; our product rationalization initiatives, while putting some near-term pressure on revenue will ultimately serve to strengthen the business. At the beginning of the year, we were optimistic that EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012 would show improvement compared to the first half. As I have stated at a few investor conferences in September, we\u2019re no longer seeing this being the case, due primarily to growth challenges on the Enterprise side and the length of time it took to reach an agreement with our union. In addition, some of the activities to reduce our reliance on older technologies and systems along with the many processed reengineering efforts we have going, have created margin pressure in the near-term. Collectively, all these initiatives are designed to improve the Wireline cost structure. We fully expect that these and other cost management actions will result in improved profitability in 2013 and over the longer term. To that end, for the past 15 months we have talked about the importance of concluding our union contract negotiations and coming up with a contract that is fair and balanced for our employees, but at the same time, addresses some key issues related to our ability to achieve improvements in our cost structure. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about the contract on slide 15. On September 19th, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new thee year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. The contracts are currently in the ratification process which typically takes 30 days, so we hope to be able to announce a definitive agreement very soon. Under the tentative agreement, there are changes to medical and prescription drug plans for active and retired associates including contributions toward healthcare premiums for active employees. In addition, current retirees will make contributions toward healthcare premiums for some medical plans while associates who retire after January 1, 2013 will make premium contributions regardless of the medical plan which they enroll in. New associates hired from this point forward will be eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan instead of a traditional pension plan. The agreement also makes changes to old legacy policies including tighter absence controls and better quality control and training practices. There are new provisions that will result in better work rule flexibility such as national cost sharing which will improve the customer experience and allow our associates to work more efficiently and cost effectively. Since the contract has not yet been ratified, I am not going to quantify the annual cost savings at this time. We will have an opportunity to communicate this information at an investor conference in early November, so stay tuned for more information on this subject. Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, a very good third quarter, keeping us solidly on-track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We are executing our plans and investing for the future. Consolidated revenue growth is increasing and we have had four successive quarters of EBITDA margin expansion with the third quarter being the highest margin since 2008. We have built strong earnings momentum with three successes of quarters of double-digit growth and have generated 50% more free cash flow than last year at this time. Our disciplined capital spending and revenue growth is driving improved capital efficiency. In Wireless, we further solidified our excellent spectrum position by closing all our pending transactions. And with our 4G LTE network advantage, our unmatched product portfolio and our well received Share Everything plans we feel a confident about our ability to sustain our industry leading profitability in 2013 and beyond. In Wireline, although we have work to do, we are putting the right plans in place to strengthen the business and improve profitability in 2013 and over the longer-term. Our strategic investments and actions position us very well for sustainable growth. We continue to build for the future and while may have some near-term challenges, we are successfully executing a well conceived plan that will drive profitability and create shareholder value in 2013 and into the future. With that, I will now turn the call back to John, so we can address your questions.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Fran. Brad let's open it up for questions please.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: First on FiOS just a question on video; Fran you talked about certain impacts in the quarter and you talked about the potential for this to rebound next quarter. I think what you talked about in the Q2 call was sort of a normal run rate of 150 to 170, is that still a target range we should think about for 4Q? And then second question just on the pension structure in terms of the feel and the $7.5 billion, can you help us think through how that impacts the P&L, what that does to the expense stream in wireline? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: First on the FiOS growth, yeah I think that I gave a range of 150 to 170; where we came out of September I am very confident that we will get to that 150 plus for net adds in the fourth quarter, so I think that's a good target. And then on the pension side, I think that from a P&L perspective, it\u2019s very hard for me to distinguish at this point in time; there are so many fluctuations here. But I think the key to this whole thing a couple of points I want to make here. So from just an overall cash perspective which is the real key here, because this is really the cash impact of the business. As you know we made a first half contribution of $600 million. In the third quarter, we added another $1.2 billion to the plan, so $1.8 billion from a cash impact perspective to-date and in the fourth quarter we determined that we will put another $1.6 billion into the plan. All these contributions are tax deductible. We will not have any 2013 contributions and that based on our planning and the assumptions that we have in this transaction, the future cash contributions to the pension plan will be less post this transaction close, which we anticipate to be early December. So from that perspective, that to me is the important part. I think everything else is pretty minimal at this point in time.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Thanks Fran, and you talked about this being applicable to current retirees, is there any prospects for taking this in to sort of the active employee base?\nFran Shammo: I think at this time, we've no more definitive agreement at this time and to extend this transaction. This transaction is specifically related to management retirees, who retire before January 1 of 2010. It does not impact current active management employees. It does not impact current active union represented employees nor does it impact retiree union represented employees.\nJohn Doherty : Thanks Jason. Brad could we move on to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: If we could just talk about margins little bit here; first on the wireless side, you know, last year you guys saw a little over 500 to 600 sequential decline in the fourth quarter mostly related to fourth quarter launch of the iPhone. Does the earlier launch of the iPhone sort of lower that decline along with some of the another initiatives you\u2019ve been doing. If you just could about, what do you expect from a trending standpoint there? And then on the wireline side, I know you guys don\u2019t want to give the details on the union contract, but can we start to see some of the benefits as early as the fourth quarter or what kind of trend are you looking for there?\nFran Shammo: So on the wireless margin, look I think that this has a lot to do with volume, right? So the iPhone 5 came out in very late September. There really wasn\u2019t all that much volume on the iPhone 5. If you look at our total iPhone adds, we added 3.1 million, 1.1 million than we did a year ago, and about 651,000 of them were iPhone 5s, the rest were 4 and 4S.  What we\u2019re seeing here is, we\u2019re seeing that the iPhone 5 we had supply constraints, we\u2019re not sure where we\u2019re going to stand in the fourth quarter with those constraints. But what we\u2019re seeing on the 4 and the 4S is that we\u2019re attracting customers who probably previously did not come to Verizon because of the cost point of that iPhones. So, I think you saw that in our net adds growth for the quarter. So, again from a trending perspective and all the work that we\u2019ve done around cost and the $2 billion, and if you look at the three years; we\u2019ve taken out $5 billion of cost structure of wireless.  Again, I think that given the volume, there could be some dilution in that margin. If the volumes exceed what they were in the third quarter, which I anticipate they will. If you recall back to the first quarter, I said we would accelerate our growth throughout the quarters for the year, as we come out of the third quarter. You saw we posted our highest growth in the last four years, and I think that we will accelerate that growth into the fourth quarter. So, yes, I think we will have some deterioration in the margins in the fourth quarter for wireless. But at this point I can\u2019t tell you what that will be, because I don\u2019t know what the volume will be. But obviously, I don\u2019t anticipate it to be as much as it was a year ago. Great, and then on the wireline side, I think this story is a much more complex story. But in the short, just for the union piece of this, I think, we\u2019ll wait till the fourth quarter, but you\u2019re not going to see any benefits this year. But I don\u2019t want to really get into the details until this contract is ratified. A number of unions have ratified it, but it will not be ratified by all until the next couple of days are over. So, once that happens I will give some more clarity around this add during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter.\nJohn Doherty : Thanks John. Brat could we move on to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Fran, could you talk to us about these 700 MHz spectrum process where you stand in that, how it\u2019s looking so far, when do you think you might be able to give us some more news on that? And then what are the implications of that and what\u2019s the likely timing of another decision on the Verizon wireless dividend to the parent Verizon and to Vodafone? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: So on the 700 MHz we started this process late in the third quarter, the process is ongoing. We have a lot of interested parties, a lot of complexity to the bidding process here from the individual respective party. So there is a lot of work to be done here and we are not ready to talk about exactly where we are with these.  I think the important point though is, we are going to analyze each and every bid. We are also developing our own internal plans to launch this spectrum, because as I said before, this is not a fire sale on spectrum. So if we do not get fair value or what we believe to be fair value, then we will use this spectrum internally.  But at this point I think it\u2019s too early to communicate exactly how this will proceed, but I think it will happen late in the fourth quarter possibly not till the first quarter, and if we do come to terms with some of these than it has to go through the normal FCC approval. We are probably very close on that, probably till late third quarter, fourth quarter of 2013.  As far as Vodafone dividend; this is a very interesting question. Because I think we all forget that on January of 2012 we actually did do a dividend that\u2019s $10 billion, and throughout the year during our normal course we did about another $4.5 billion of tax distributions. So year-to-date, we have done $14.5 billion of dividend distributions out of wireless.  To talk about a further dividend, I think it\u2019s pretty mature, we have an agreement with Vodafone that we will discuss this before the end of the year, and once we have that discussion and we will report out what the decision will be.\nJohn Doherty : Brad could we move on to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick - JPMorgan: Two things, one I wonder, if you can tell us whether substantially higher portion of phones came in with no subsidy this quarter, people paying for price and it is [down] their previous plan that happened in the past?\nFran Shammo: Yeah, Phil, so obviously, if you look at our growth and you look at the number of phones we have moved, the majority of the phones sales incurred a subsidy on them. But we did have a number of customers who actually paid full price for phones to remain on the unlimited plan. So we did have some customers who made that choice and stayed with Verizon Wireless.  But for the majority most of the smartphones that we sold included a subsidy. But we also had our large volume in our postpaid tablet category, and we also had a large volume in our internet category, and they carry for the postpaid tablets at really no subsidy. And on the internet devices, we almost doubled the amount of net adds we had from second quarter to third quarter, which was a contribution to our Share Everything plan and they have a reduce subsidy compared to what a smartphone would be, but the majority of devices did have a subsidy.\nPhil Cusick - JPMorgan: You mentioned that given the Septembers results you expect FiOS to be over a 150. Is that more a seasonal shift or are you putting a little more effort in to promotion and marketing here?\nFran Shammo: Well I think it\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. Number one, I think as I said coming out of second quarter, we probably moved away a little bit too much of promotional activity. So we picked that up in September, and the third quarter is a very high seasonality of moves for us and this is always a third quarter issue with FiOS, because people move out of the area and we can't retain them because they move to an area that does not have FiOS availability to them.  We are doing a lot of effort in reconnecting existing homes that already have an O&T on the side of the house, for people who have moved in. So you are going to see a lot more activity around that. I also think that we did see some pressure in the current phase from the price upset we had. And I think those price ups were all done now, so I think we are going to stabilize here and I'm very comfortable that we\u2019ll get back to that 150,000 plus for net add projection.\nJohn Doherty : Thanks Phil. Brad the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Seitz of Jefferies.\nTom Seitz - Jefferies: Fran I would like to discuss copper shutdown a little bit. AT&T has publicly stated that for them to invest in the 20 million access lines they have got under a strategic review, they are going to need relief from copper circuit-switched TDM regulations. If they were to get that, would you consider applying for the same relief and accelerating the copper shutdown?  I ask because at current course and speed in the neighborhood of $200,000 conversions per year that's 50 plus years to shutdown the redundant copper plant, and its probably the largest structural impediment to improving wireline margins. \nFran Shammo: From a copper shutdown perspective its highly unlikely that you will ever see a Verizon have no copper in their network, because of the vastness of this network. But I think strategically the way we have approached this from a copper-to-fiber migration all copper is not created equal. We have areas where the copper has really deteriorated because its 60 years plus, and we are strategically going after what we call chronic troubles and that is a truck roll that happens in a period of six months time and that costs us about 900 hours in cash from a perspective of that.  So, when you look at the overall investment that we have to make to migrate that customer from copper to FiOS, its more cost effective to go after those chronic problems first. But not all of the network that leads into one switch is having these chronic problems. So to think about decommissioning every switch in our network would be a huge cost undertaking.  So we believe that the strategy we've outlaid with our copper-to-fiber migration is financially viable, it\u2019s better for the customer, we see that from the customers who we have migrated in the short term, they are actually buying up in the FiOS quantum and generating $10 plus more ARPU. So we are strategically going after this.  We have also received a lot of regulatory relief already in the states that we deal with, from being a carrier of lost resort, replacing in Pennsylvania, fulfilling our obligation of bringing broadband to customers via (PA30) rulings which would be with wireless instead of wireline, which is a much more financial beneficial to Verizon. So we have already explored a lot of this regulatory highway and we will continue with our copper to fiber migration under the plan that we are executing. \nJohn Doherty : Thanks Tom. Brad the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.\nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: First if I could ask my quarterly question for an update on the net debt at Verizon wireless, and then secondly just moving over to the wireline side, can you give us an update on the VDMS segment and just the strategy that you are continuing to pursue there, the progress including the relationship that you have with Redbox? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Sure thanks, Mike. So your general normal quarterly question I have it right here is gross debt of $10 billion, cash of $8.1, so net debt of about $1.9 billion. And then on the Wireline side of house was VDMS; we are making significant progress. We have been dealing with, what we call a number of chartered customers which includes many content providers and movie houses in helping us to customize this package and get this thing to market. We anticipate that it will come to market in 2013; I won't be specific on that date at this point in time, but we believe we have a very viable product to come to marketplace that will significantly change the way content is, if you will, packaged and picked and shipped. So we will have more to say on that within 2013, but I think that will start to contribute to some of the Wireline top growth and help to improve the margin overall.\nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: Thanks very much.\nFran Shammo: I am sorry, I mentioned Redbox. Now, we are very close to launching here in the fourth quarter of Redbox. VDMS plays a very critical role in the content delivery with that joint-venture with Redbox and again, I think moving into 2013, the business case that we have with us with Redbox will improve our topline and contribute to the profitability of the overall Wireline segment.\nJohn Doherty: Alright, let\u2019s keep this moving. Thanks Mike. Brad lets take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo: Great, thank you, Fran. If I could, could you provide a little color on your CapEx trend; I understand you are saving on the 3G spend, but given these impacts of postpaid net add results and growth in internet devices, I would think you would need to continue to spend on capacity. I guess I am just trying to understand if this is all benefited following 3G or also a result of your spectrum position?\nFran Shammo:  Yeah, thanks Jennifer for the question. I think that from a CapEx perspective as I said all along, I believe that 2012 would be flat, I am saying now it will definitely be down from our 2011 spend; I think the trajectory in the \u201913 will be very similar to the \u201912. I think what you\u2019ll see is what you saw in the third quarter that we continue to very closely manage the CapEx on the Wireline side of the business, meanwhile Wireless will continue with their plan to build out the 4G LTE by mid-year, next year compared to our 3G footprint. I don\u2019t see a substantial change in the CapEx trajectory here, but obviously, this does depend on growth and we hang our hat on being the best network, most reliable network in the industry and that we\u2019re not going to loose that position. So Wireless has been A plus in this area and I don\u2019t believe that will change, but I don\u2019t think there is a significant change in the capital trajectory here.\nJohn Doherty:  Thanks, Jennifer. Brad, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike McCormack of Nomura. Your line is open.\nMike McCormack - Nomura: Fran, maybe just a quick comment, you talked a little bit about the cover migration process and yeah there\u2019s obviously some leg to that and the longer term benefits I think are pretty clear, but just give us a sense if you can as to maybe the magnitude of margin pressure as you do that migration process over the next two year or so? And then, secondly on the Wireless side, we\u2019ve had this sort of honeymoon with the change in policy with respect to upgrade window that I think should be coming to a close right about now. So as we look into the fourth quarter and you\u2019ve got this pool of people that are now upgrade eligible, that have not been for the last six months. How should we be thinking about upgrade percentages as we go through maybe both 4Q as well as 1Q? Thanks. \nFran Shammo: Hey thanks Mike. So migration in Wireline pressure I guess there is a couple of things here and it\u2019s not just the migration, but obviously doing some of this work does increase some CapEx to us and thus increase some of the operating expense to us, but I would say that\u2019s in combination with a lot of other things that we are doing. But this positions us for the future. I would say though that beyond this from a pressure standpoint on Wireline obviously the third quarter to us is always a seasonal pressure point from a weather condition, the construction issue, fiber cuts and so forth, so that\u2019s not unusual for the third quarter to be a bigger margin pressure for us. But the delay of the union contract had an impact on our margins, the Hughes results, obviously if you go back and look at Hughes on a standalone basis, they contribute to dilution in the Wireline segment because that is now included in the Wireline. As we said, we are in the process of retooling the enterprise which is putting a little bit of pressure in the expense category with system consolidation and product rationalization. And then we have also deliberately have gone out during the third quarter and we will probably do a little bit of this in the fourth quarter and accelerated some of the repairs and maintenance within our facilities. We are also doing some additional work in our networks to increase our diversity and reliability within the Wireline network. So there is a lot of things that\u2019s putting a little bit of pressure on the Wireline, but again I think we are taking this opportunity during the low of the economic condition, preparing for this economic turn that hopefully will come in 2013 and I think we will be in a better position to ride that wave when it comes. So I think it\u2019s a combination of all that. And then on the Wireless side, the upgrade window, I guess the way I would put it this way is, our upgrade percentage will be more in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, but I will tell you, I think it will be less in the fourth quarter of a year ago.\nMike McCormack - Nomura: Okay. And just, I am sorry, just circle backing the Wireline side, should you be thinking about the third quarter is not the right starting point as we go in the fourth quarter, if it\u2019s the seasonality impact, we\u2019ll be looking at 2Q as the run rate?\nFran Shammo: Well, I think what I would say is for the third and the fourth quarter, I think you will see similar performance here, while we reposition ourselves, but this will position us for improved profitability in 2013.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks Mike. Brad, the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie: Thank you. There are a lot of questions this week on what the impact would be from the (inaudible) entry into the U.S. Does this at all change the way you run your business over the next couple of years, whilst Sprint and T-Mobile are going for the regulatory approval integration and network build out processes and what if anything will be the long term impact on Verizon\u2019s Wireless business?\nFran Shammo: So let me just start out with the couple of things here, because it\u2019s important. First, as I said in few of the investor conferences, I anticipated and we suspected some consolidation. And I think what the market should walk away with here is that there are two very large companies willing to invest in the U.S. wireless market. I believe this is a sign and it is very good for the industry and I think this shows the strength of the U.S. market and the growth potential that\u2019s still available within this market. I think, what this means from us is a couple of things. First, if you go back to January, 2011, the biggest that Lowell and I made was, we are all about executing on our plans. We have invested and built and remain on our brand to be the best and most reliable network. We have pioneered, launched and now are the largest 4G LTE network with more coverage than all of our competitors combined. I think if you look at our spectrum holding, we have a superior spectrum holding and quality of spectrum with our 700 MHz contiguous across the United States which we've launched our 4G LTE network launch on, and with the closing of our AWS spectrum with the cable companies. So I think we are in a very strong position from a spectrum holding perspective. If you look at our capital, and in the past we've taken a little heat from the market for the amount of capital that we have spent on our networks. But if you look at, on average we spend about $10 billion per year investing in our wireless and our wireline IP backbone support for that wireless network, and I think at the end of the day, you would all agree that execution equal results here. I think the third quarter results speak for themselves. So we will continue to execute and we will continue to lead the industry.\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie: Just a quick question, new reports indicate Isis is finally launching on Monday. Can you confirm this and what's the strategy going to be there to compete against Square, Google Wallet and others. \nFran Shammo: I think that at this point we let Isis answer those questions. They are going to launch and we will see how the trial markets doing, and then we will go from there.\nJohn Doherty : Thanks Kevin. Brad can we take next one please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: Now that we are getting some visibility here on the number of postpaid accounts that you have, I was wondering if you can give us a little more color here on the portion of them that are business accounts. And then just sticking with Share Everything, it sounds like the initial benefit you got out of the gate was that households are starting to attach internet devices like tablets and other and MiFi. Was that the principal benefit or did you actually see an increase in the attachment rate of smartphones on existing households, mean that maybe homes were taking advantage of the plan to consolidate people who maybe, have been on different carriers all on to Verizon.\nFran Shammo: So on the accounts, we're not going to split the accounts here between business and consumer. We will just leave it as we will give the accounts, we will give the devices per account and the ARPA on that.  As far as the Share Everything plans, I think the best answer is we're seeing a little bit of everything. We're seeing our customers move from their old legacy plants. We're seeing customers who were on unlimited plans, move to Share Everything plan. Now you would think that these initial customers that moved are optimizing from that. But what we're seeing is that they are attaching more devices. That includes more smartphones, and especially with the price points now and some of the lower end iPhones that we're seeing more attachment rates there.  We're seeing a lot of attachment on internet, Wi-Fi devices. And I think what we're seeing is they are attaching the MiFi device at $20 price point, rather than each individually attaching a tablet. So, I think we're seeing very good success in MiFi attachment rates, and from tablets, we're seeing some of that but probably not as much as we had expected. But the MiFi attachment is running extremely higher than we expected. So I think overall, again, what we're seeing in Share Everything is better than what we had expected in our business case.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks Brad. Brad, we are going to take two more questions. I know folks you\u2019ve had a busy night with our pension release as well as - that\u2019s why we got our earnings out a little bit early. So we will take two more. I know you also have another busy day ahead of you with some other meetings. So let\u2019s move on for two more questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: Fran, two questions; one related to the data side of things. It looks like Sprint and T-Mobile are really going to be focused on unlimited data. As they get their networks up to speed in a few years, how do you convey to your customers that, your share data is still economical and makes sense for customers like, really how you\u2019re positioned against that? And do you think they can continue to afford to do it?  Secondly, as these companies really restructure their networks in the next two years, historically have you been able to capture share to those periods, and do you think you\u2019ll be able to kind of do that again, I know it\u2019s early stages with what PCS and T-Mobile are doing, and what Sprint\u2019s but maybe your expectations for the next few years in share gains?\nFran Shammo: I tried to answer your question in my speech on industry consolidation, but maybe I didn\u2019t do a good enough job. But on the data side of the house, I think our network and our competitive advantage speaks for itself. And I think superiority of our network; I think what you\u2019re seeing is that we\u2019re competing in that arena today against the unlimited plans.  As far as the network goes, we\u2019ve invested $10 billion, probably in the last 10 years in our network. It\u2019s going to be difficult for others to make that within two years as you say. So, I think that\u2019s a longer term plan. But, look it\u2019s all good for the industry. The industry is focused on the growth, but there is a lot of opportunity out there, and we\u2019ve proven that we can be a leader in the industry and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks, Tim. Brad, this will be the last question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chaplin - Credit Suisse Securities: Looking at the upgrade rate, it looks like you are on a trend to have an upgrade rate this year that\u2019s below your historical rate of about 32% a year. Can that continue to go down in 2013, and if it does, with the 50% EBITDA margins in wireless this quarter, where can wireless EBITDA margins go next year and longer term? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: On the upgrade rate, yes, I do think it will decline. There is a lot of things that we took in place from 2010 all the way through, but I think that that will continue happen. As I said in the fourth quarter, it will be more than the third quarter obviously; but I think we will be less than a year ago and I see that trend continuing.  As far as wireless margins, I will leave at this. If you trend out on a graph over the last 10 years what wireless has done given we grow and more profitable, you will see that we will continue to manage that balance and continue to increase our overall portfolio in our profitability.\nJohn Doherty: Thanks Jonathan. Brad that concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation and thank you for using Verizon conference services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on the website. Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I\u2019d like to cover a few items upfront. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64, up 12.3% from last year and $0.05 higher than the first quarter. To the first half of the year, EPS of $1.23 was 15% higher than a year ago. There were no special items of non-operational nature included in our reported results for the second quarter or the first half of this year or the comparable periods in 2011. In terms of activity below the operating income line, you will note that equity in earnings from unconsolidated businesses, which is primarily our minority interest in Vodafone Italy declined by about $50 million this quarter due to the continued economic pressures in Europe. This represents about $0.02 in earnings per share. other than that, there is nothing unusual in terms of other income, interest or income taxes. I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. with that, I'll turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our financial results. We continue to execute well across the entire business. Solid top line performance combined with a strong focus on profitability, and cost management has resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the last two quarters. This strong operating performance together with our disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. Through the first half of the year, we generated $7.8 billion of free cash flow, which is more than twice the amount we generated in the first half of 2011. The Wireless business is firing on all cylinders and our strategic actions and results clearly demonstrate our position of leadership in the industry. We continue to post strong growth in retail service revenue, driven by increased smartphone penetration, Internet device adoption and new customer additions. In the second quarter, this top line growth combined with effective cost management and excellent customer retention resulted in a record setting EBITDA service margin of 49%, which surpassed our previous high of 47.8% in the third quarter of last year. In Wireline, consumer revenues were up 2.5%, which was the highest growth rate we've seen in several years. While we continue to face challenges in the enterprise and wholesale markets, we are confident that the decisions we\u2019re making and the actions we are taking are the right ones for the long-term. We're intensely focused on profitability management and key actions related to this include product portfolio rationalization, targeted pricing moves and cost management initiatives. I will go through these in more detail during our segment review. In time, these actions will result improved wireline profitability. in spite of some revenue softness this quarter, we were able to increase the EBITDA margin by 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% and our objective is to have a stronger EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012. Overall, our strong second quarter and first half putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. Let\u2019s begin our review with a look at consolidated results on slide four. We sustain solid consolidated growth trends in the quarter, with contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue grew to $28.6 billion, up 3.7%. Our focus on expense control helped drive double-digit operating income growth of 15.5%. To put this in perspective, while consolidated revenue increased $310 million sequentially, operating income is up over $450 million. This clearly demonstrates that our product rationalization, cost management, and process improvement efforts are starting to payoff. We continue to be very focused on improving profitability, moving more of every dollar we generate to the bottom line. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.8 billion and our margin expanded to 34.2%, up 150 basis points on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. The upshot is an improved earnings growth trajectory for this year. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, we posted better than 12% EPS growth in the second quarter and we are up 15% year-to-date, which is at the upper end of the guidance we provided in January of last year. Let\u2019s turn now to cash flow and capital spending on slide five. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $3 billion sequentially to $5.4 billion driven by a 56% increase in cash from operations and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $690 million compared to last year. For the first half, capital spending of $7.4 billion was down more than 16% year-to-date. Our outlook for the full-year is flat to down versus $16.2 billion in 2011. We continue to expect our annual CapEx to revenue ratio to decline, based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. In Wireless, CapEx in the second quarter was $2 billion, which was 23% lower than last year. Through the first half, Wireless capital was $3.9 billion, was down 27% year-over-year. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we were spending more for 3G capacity in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. Going forward, we expect to see continued migration of traffic from 3G to our lower cost 4G LTE platform, which will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency. We will also continue expanding our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation by a wide margin. In Wireline, we spent $1.6 billion in capital during the second quarter, 5.3% less than last year. Through the first half, Wireline capital was essentially flat with last year at $3.1 billion. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remained very strong. Total debt of $52.4 billion is down $2.8 billion since the end of last year. Net debt was $42.4 billion at the end of June and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2 times. Let\u2019s now move into our review of the segments starting with Wireless on slide six. Our Wireless business had another very impressive quarter sustaining strong growth in retail service revenue, higher retail postpaid ARPU growth and excelling cost and churn management resulting in our highest EBITDA service margin ever. Total Wireless revenues of $18.6 billion grew 7.4% and now represents 65% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue year-to-date. Our revenue results were driven by 8.6% growth in retail service revenue. Postpaid revenue, which makes up most of retail service, grew 8.3%. Retail prepaid revenue was also very strong, up 27.2%, the highest growth we\u2019ve seen in four years. Total service revenue grew 7.3% this quarter and is up 7.5%, year-to-date. Data which represents almost 44% of service revenue grew 18.5% to $6.9 billion in the quarter. Retail postpaid data revenue grew more than 20%. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connection growth on slide seven. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and internet devices, with the unmatched service quality of the nations largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry leading 94.2 million retail connection, with nearly 89 million postpaid and more than 5.3 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 1.2 million new retail net connection; 888,000 postpaid and 290,000 prepaid. Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I\u2019d highlight another strong quarter of retail prepaid performance with a 24% sequential increase and net adds. Similarly last quarter, tablets represented a little more than half of the add, however this quarter 95% of our prepaid tablet additions were 4G LTE, which is key from the standpoint of better operating and capital efficiency. In postpaid, our 888,000 net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 501,000 in the first quarter. Our porting ratios with the major carriers continue to be strong and our churn metrics remain excellent. Retail postpaid churn of 0.84% is the lowest we\u2019ve seen in four years. Postpaid growth additions in the quarter were just over $3.1 million, up about 3% sequentially. As expected, upgrades were lower sequentially with about 7% of our postpaid base upgrading devices in the quarter. In addition to increasing smartphone penetration, we also continue to make good progress with internet devices, which include postpaid tablets. In the second quarter about 90% of the internet device sales were 4G LTE. We are far and away the market leader in this space with more than 7.5 million internet device connections in our retail postpaid base. Next, let\u2019s turn to slide eight and take a look at smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 50%. Once again an increasing majority of retail postpaid phone sales were smartphone, 73% compared with 60% a year ago. During the second quarter, we activated 2.9 million Android smartphones, 2.5 million of which were 4G LTE and 2.7 million Apple iPhone, up from 2.3 million a year ago. During the second quarter 25% of iPhone sales were gross adds or new to Verizon, with 75% representing upgrades from existing customers. In terms of 4G phone sales 20% were new to Verizon and 80% upgrades. Importantly, more than 40% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time. Retail postpaid ARPU was $56.13 this quarter, up 3.7%, which was higher than the previous record growth of 3.6% last quarter. In terms of the mix, retail postpaid phone ARPU of about $58, grew 4.9% while internet device ARPU of about $47, declined 6.6%. As expected, Internet device ARPU has become less dilutive to blended post data ARPU and growth. In addition, these devices continue to generate double-digit service revenue growth. Our 4G LTE deployment has expanded the market for these devices. All of which enables higher usage of our network. Our Share Everything plans, which became available on June 28 represent a new and innovative pricing framework, providing a unique customer value proposition and at the same time creating an optimal way for us to monetize increasing data usage. These strategic thrust of these plans is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage. Our plans are designed to make the decision to upgrade to a smartphone or add a tablet much easier. By allowing up to 10 devices to share data, these plans also provide for the creation and adoption of all kinds of new connected devices. Early feedback has been great and our customer adoption is tracking with our expectations. We are seeing a wide variety of customers and family share accounts opting into Share Everything, including existing smartphone customers with unlimited data plans. Let\u2019s turn to slide 9, as I\u2019d like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE coverage, which is now available in 337 markets covering more than 230 million tops, which is nearly 75% of the U.S. population. And point of fact, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors networks combined. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nation wide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We continue to be very pleased with 4G LTE adoption. Customer awareness of our 4G LTE network superiority is increasing. And our new brand advertising further positions us as the network of choice for 4G LTE. Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily, each and every quarter since we launched service about a year and half ago. During the second quarter, 4G LTE smartphone sales increased more than 16% sequentially to 2.5 million units, nearly a 11 million or 12% of our 89 million retail postpaid connections are 4G LTE. Roughly 70% are smartphones, and 30% are Internet devices. Stated in other way, about 19% of our smartphone base has a 4G LTE handset, and more than 43% of our Internet device connections are 4G LTE. While these statistics are impressive in their own way, they also show we have lots of room to grow, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward. Let\u2019s conclude our Wireless segment review with the discussion about profitability on slide 10. We generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, which is an increase of 15.8% and expanded our EBITDA service margins by 270 basis points sequentially to 49%, again a record high for us. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our sustained ability to execute well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of sustained service revenue and ARPU growth, an intense focus on cost management, lower upgrade eligibility, and consistently excellent in churn metrics are contributing to our industry leading margin performance. We will continue to look at all opportunities within our cost structure to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. As I previously indicated, we have identified $2 billion in cost savings opportunities in wireless, and we remain right on track to successfully capture these savings. On the transaction front, our purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice. We continue to expect approval and to close these transactions this summer. Our plans for an open sale process for our 700 megahertz A and B spectrum licenses are proceeding as planned, but of course remain contingent upon the closing of the AWS purchases I just mentioned. The agreement that we announced in late June with T-Mobile to exchange specific spectrum in the AWS band is also contingent upon the closing of those transactions. These license transfers also require FCC approval, which is expected later this summer. These transactions are good for all parties and the industry as a whole, as we facilitate the best first use of this spectrum for all players. We appreciate the constructive role the FCC has played in this process, and look forward to securing approval. Let\u2019s move to our wireline segment next on slide 11. Second quarter wireline revenues were flat sequentially, but declined 3.1% year-over-year. From a profitability perspective, wireline EBITDA declined 6% year-over-year, but improved about 2% on a sequential basis, with EBITDA margin moving up 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% despite lower quarterly revenue. Wireline revenue is affected by a number of underlying factors. On the upside, revenue growth is accelerating in the consumer market, driven by FiOS, which again at 2.5% was the highest growth we\u2019ve seen in several years. Enterprise and wholesale revenue continues to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe as well as by related foreign exchange movements. In addition, as we indicated last quarter, we are also making deliberate and specific moves to rationalize and simplify our Enterprise Solutions product portfolio, eliminating products where they no longer make sense, reducing product complexity, streamlining services, and consolidating networks to improve efficiency and product profitability. We currently have more than 700 different products and thousands of variations that are defined by particular geography, network or system. This portfolio simplification effort will dramatically improve our go-to-market speed and operations quality. In the near-term, these actions create revenue impacts. Over time however, the actions will result in margin benefits and improved profitability. We estimate that about 65% of the overall wireline revenue decline this quarter was a result of our own deliberate actions to improve profitability. Examples include the de-emphasis of drop-ship CPE, the continued exit from certain international wholesale routes and contracts, decommissioning end of life products like ATM, frame relay and IP VPN, no longer offering dry-loop DSL or selling DSL in FiOS markets, and exiting non-strategic product lines by calling cards and payphones. Again, we firmly believe that these are the right actions to be taking at this time. We are on the right track, and I\u2019m confident that these product rationalization and process simplification initiatives, along with additional cost management actions will improve the long-term profitability of the wireline business. Let\u2019s take a closer look at revenue results starting with mass markets on slide 12. Within mass markets, consumer revenue growth of 2.5% improved from 1.7% and 1.3% in each of the last two quarters. As a result, our pricing actions related to set-top box rentals, triple play bundles, and higher data speeds available through our new FiOS Quantum offer. The outlook for accelerating consumer revenue growth in the next several quarters looks very encouraging. Our residential connections trends also continue to improve. We lost 199,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.6% decline year-over-year, compared with a loss of $240,000 or 8.2% at this time last year. FiOS revenue grew 17.4% in the quarter and now represents 65% of consumer revenue. As a result of the increasing scale of FiOS, total consumer ARPU is now over $100, up 8.5% from a year ago. FiOS ARPU now stands at more than $149 per month and 70% of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play, with voice, Internet and video services. In terms of broadband, we added 134,000 new FiOS Internet additions and now have more than 5.1 million subscribers, representing a penetration of 36.6%. We had a net loss of 132,000 DSL subscribers, which is higher than the last few quarters primarily due to seasonality. We believe that the discontinuance of dry loop DSL, also negatively impacted net add, but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. In FiOS Video, we added 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.5 million and increasing our penetration to 32.6%. We continue to seek ways to drive FiOS revenue growth, improve operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability. Key parts of the strategy include targeted pricing actions, further differentiating our services with the offers like FiOS Quantum. Our copper to fiber migration in areas with chronic repair issues within FiOS markets, and a number of other cost management initiatives. In light of these actions, we feel a more natural range for FiOS quarterly net adds going forward should be about 20,000 to 30,000 less than our previous range of 180,000 to 200,000. We are confident that at these levels, we can still maintain an increasing revenue growth trajectory and expand profitability. Let\u2019s move next to our business markets starting with global enterprise. Global Enterprise revenue was down $32 million sequentially or less than 1%, but declined $136 million or 3.4% year-over-year. In addition to a $70 million impact from lower CPE sales in the quarter, foreign currency translation had an $84 million adverse impact on growth as the stronger dollar versus the euro, and pound sterling caused the decline in the current quarter compared with the benefit a year ago. Absent these effects, we would have had positive revenue growth in spite of the continued secular and global economic challenges. Strategic services, which comprises 52% of global enterprise revenue totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform well in these services, international and FX are having an adverse effect on growth at this time. Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall wireline revenue growth and profitability, particularly as we work through our product streamlining and process efficiency initiatives. Our strategic realignment of Verizon Enterprise Solutions will better position us to unlock value in the core business, while better aligning our strength in high growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine, and advanced communications. We remain confident in the strength of the enterprise asset portfolio and the value it will generate over the long term. On the acquisition front, our purchase of Hughes Telematics has passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino stage, and we expect to complete the transaction in third quarter. We look forward to combining Hughes Telematics\u2019 robust service delivery platform and suite of applications with our global IP network, cloud, mobility, and security solutions. We believe that this platform has the potential to reach beyond automotive and transportation and create new M2M opportunities in mobile health, asset tracking, and home automation to name a few. Moving next to global wholesale, revenues in the second quarter declined $34 million or 2% sequentially and $203 million or 10% year-over-year due primarily to declines in transport services. We continue to take all the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space, as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s. Let\u2019s move now to our summary slide. Overall, a strong second quarter and first half putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We continue to execute very well. Our solid top line performance in the first half of the year has been fueled by strong retail service revenues in wireless and increasing growth in consumer wireline. Our record-high wireless margins in the second quarter combined with our strong focus on improving profitability through product rationalization and cost management in the wireline has driven double-digit growth and consolidated operating income, and earnings per share for the last two quarters. This strong operating performance together with our disciplined capital spending drove significant increases in free cash flow and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. We expect to continue to build on this momentum and look forward to a strong second half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions.\nJohn N. Doherty:  Thanks, Brian. Before we jump into questions, I know that we are having some link issues with the IR website this morning. we are working on it, and all the typical documents will be available shortly if they are not already. With that Brad, let's take our first question, please.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) our first question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\nJason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning, Fran. A couple of questions, first on the FiOS metrics you just talked about, sort of a new range for additions that I guess implies more or like 160,000 to 180,000 adds per quarter going forward. You flipped a little bit lower than that this quarter, I am just \u2013 can you help us think through that. You obviously talked about some price hikes, are we also at a point where the base is large enough that 2Q seasonality in video i.e., were negative, and then rebounced in 3Q, is this starting to catch up with the business as well. And then second question, just on the wireless distribution. it was roughly this time last year you announced intentions for a $10 million upstream payment to the JV partners. Can you help us think through maybe a timeline for announcing the distribution for next year and then given the stronger free cash flow you\u2019ve seen in the business, would that point sort of conceptually to a bigger distribution? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yeah. sure, Jason, thanks for the question. So first on the FiOS piece. just a couple of things here, so yes, there was \u2013 we actually did have slower growth in this quarter than we anticipated. so a couple of factors here, one was there was a seasonable unusually high move season in the month of June compared to prior second quarter. so we experienced some additional moves out and normally in this business, it takes us a quarter to recapture the move in. So I think that partially would set off from a timing difference. But more importantly, I think that we have refocused more on our profit, on the FiOS side. So first we went through these price ups, you saw some of the benefits there in the first quarter, where we drove our consumer revenue growth, the 2.5%. And this was the price ups of our set-top boxes and you\u2019re going to see more price ups coming in the third quarter around the bundles and into the fourth quarter. In addition, we launched our Quantum product and the price ups that we have on people choosing additional speeds. I am extremely confident with both of these actions. We can double our revenue growth by the end of this year from 2.5% to around 5%, and I am very confident that we can accomplish that. So, one is that that we\u2019re really concentrating on revenue growth. Second is, as you know we\u2019ve really concentrated around copper to FiOS migration. We nearly doubled the amount of migrations we did in the second quarter versus the first quarter and also what we\u2019re seeing is, the first quarter migrations that we accomplished, these customers are generating more ARPU, close migrations and free, because they are also selecting higher speeds under our Quantum offers. So I think the range as we said is probably in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 170,000. I know you said, 160,000 to 180,000 but it\u2019s around 150 to 170. But we are on a steady growth pattern, and I believe that we are really focusing in on better margins and acceleration of the top line. On the Verizon wireless dividend, I know there has been a lot of press lately out there and I am not sure where this idea is coming from, but I can tell you, right now the only thing I will say is that, there is not distribution on the agenda for the upcoming Verizon wireless board and that\u2019s probably I am going to say at this point in time.\nJason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, thanks Fran.\nJohn N. Doherty:  Brad, can we move on to the next question please.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may ask your question.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Thanks, guys. Two quick ones for you on the Wireline side; first, Fran, thanks for all the info on the product rationalization on the wholesale side. But you could give us some idea of when you think you should start to see some improvement, I think the 10% was a little bit worse than we thought, when do you think that could start to get better? And then, second of all, if you could update us on the union contract and where you are in negotiations that would be great.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Okay, great. Thanks, John. So on the wholesale side, yeah, 10% decline, this was accelerated from 8.9% in the first quarter. And to be honest, I think that we're fighting an uphill battle here on the core voice in LTE product, and that will continue to decline. The focus right now is to reposition ourselves for Ethernet and fiber-to-cell, and those products are picking up. And I think that quite honestly the range that you see here is probably the range that we will continue with somewhere between an 8% to 10% decline going forward. But again, this is a diminishing revenue stream and we will continue to manage that stream. On the union side of that half, as I've mentioned before, when we entered into these negotiations, we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult and very hard negotiations, and it was going to be a long-haul not a short-haul. And given our peers, it took them 500 days to get the contributions and some pension resets, and we're now almost the year-end of this, sort of 365 days. So, when you look at the profitability of this business over the last five years, it has decreased and this cost structure is not sustainable going forward. We really needed the business to address this cost structure in relation to the benefits, particularly healthcare contributions and pensions, and we need increased flexibility around our work rules, which we \u2013 some of these work rules date back to 1960. So we aren't asking for things that have not already been given to other companies, these are not new issues for the union, a many of our peer companies are already there. So we are standing strong on our position of cost restructure in this business, so the negotiations are continuing albeit slow and the process will take as long as it takes for us. So at this point, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll report on the union negotiation.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Great. Thanks, Fran.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, John. Brad, can we move to the next one please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. Good morning. Following up on the pension situation, have you had a chance to run the numbers on the new highway bill and the new discount rates and any impact that you may have on your near-term pension contributions? And related to that, you\u2019ve talked about strong cash flow generation this quarter, your leverages in the low ones, how are you thinking about target leverage here, about dividend increases for Verizon Corporation and potential buybacks down the road? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: \n : First, you have to look at the borrowing rates. Second, you have to look at tax rates structures, then what the current rate is versus what future rates may be. And then you have to look at the overall pension strategy that we have related to our pension plan. So at this point, I\u2019m not prepared to speak to whether we will adopt the funding plan or not adopt it, what I will tell you is, this is not material to the cash flow either this year or into the next three years, and again, it is just the timing issue. So I will have more to report on that as we complete our analysis and come into the 2013. As far as cash flow goes, we had an unbelievable quarter in cash flow from operation generation, our continued focus in on investment and making the right investments to return additional investments on that and get greater returns both in the wireline and the wireless business. As I said, we really have curtailed the spending on our EV-DO networks, which is generating more cash flow in the wireless business. But again, without really going into a lot of detail here, the dividend policy is extremely important, it is a board decision, but it is very, very important to Low and I, and we will continue to recommend to the board what we think is appropriate. And from a share buyback, as I said before, I don\u2019t think we are in a position to start buying back shares, it is always a timing issue for companies to \u2013 when the best time to do that is and at this point, we probably won\u2019t be in a position to do anything like that until late \u201913 or early \u201914.\nSimon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Simon. Brad, let\u2019s move on.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhilip Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hi, guys. Thanks Brad. You mentioned that some customers have been moving over to the new price plans, I wonder if you can give us some idea of whether we should be looking for some ARPU headwind in the third quarter versus the rapid rate that you\u2019ve been growing before it starts to sort of be accretive maybe in next year? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yeah, thanks Phil. I mean, it is very preliminary, we just launched this on June 28, so we just started in on this. I think some of the positive factors that we are seeing, is that obviously all of your adopters are always your optimizers, but to be honest based on where we are at right now, we are actually tracking ahead of where we thought we would be and we don\u2019t see any ARPU impact in the third quarter or fourth quarter. I think our trend will continue that we have established here in the first and second quarter. And the benefit though that we do see is that we are seeing some 3G unlimited customers move into our 4G share data plan product and that is excellent for us from a cash flow position on capital efficiency and cost reduction metrics. So there are some interesting things there, and then that again the other thing on ARPU here is, as Internet device ARPU continues to improve that gives us better opportunity to accelerate our overall ARPU growth.\nPhilip Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: That\u2019s all. Thanks Fran.\nJohn N. Doherty:  Thanks, Bill. Can we take the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse your line is open.\nJonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities:  Thanks. Fran, I\u2019m wondering if you can give us some context of where you think, sort of longer-term over the next three or four years, CapEx to revenue trends in wireless?\nFrancis J. Shammo:  Well, I think that without giving a lot of guidance here, beyond this year which we set our overall capital plan will be flat to down from where we were last year. Obviously, you can see that wireless is utilizing capital extremely efficiently, down, I think now or most for the year about $1.3 billion year-over-year. Our overall CapEx to revenue ratio in the first half of 2011 was 16.4%, and that\u2019s down to 13.1%, and as I said before, we are committed to continue to improve on that metric this year and continuing to \u201913 and \u201914. And I think we will leave it at that. \nJonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities: Thanks.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Jonathan. Brad, let's take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael I. Rollins \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets:\nFrancis J. Shammo:  Sure, Michael thanks. So for the end of this quarter gross debt on wireless box is a $10.9 billion. On July 1, we actually paid down another piece of that debt of $800 million. The cash rate now is $8.4 billion so net debt at the end of this quarter was $2.4 billion. On the Enterprise business just a kind of set some of this \u2013 as I said last quarter, our international revenue is about $400 million a quarter. We were growing close to 15% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, both within EMEA and in Asia. Last quarter, we said that we saw the first time that it actually went flat on year-over-year basis, and this quarter we actually saw a decline on a year-over-year basis. Strategic services is about 75% of our sales in international, which is very different than it is here in the United States. So with the FX impact and the impact that Europe is having on that strategic revenue stream that is having an overall impact on the overall strategic revenue growth. I think the important thing here is the way we move forward, is that we are really building our business around platforms. And if you look at what we\u2019ve done, we are rated number one in the world on security. We have build our data center platform around our Terremark acquisition and now we are going to build our machine-to-machine and applications platform around the Hughes Telematics. And I think that brings a different paradigm to us going forward. So I\u2019m very optimistic on the Enterprise business. We are showing still some growth in strategic services and I think if we didn\u2019t have the headwinds and some of these other economic pressures, I believe we are a double-digit strategic growth company there should be no reason why we can\u2019t get back to those numbers that we showed in the past two years. So I think this is a temporary thing, but given where we are with Europe this could be another two to three quarters out, mid \u201913 before we start to turn the corner here. But we are positioning ourselves and I think we are making all the right decisions that when we do turn the corner and get some economic release that we will show a very good portfolio here.\nMichael Raynes \u2013 Citigroup:  Thank you.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks Mike. Brad, let\u2019s move on to next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden of Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.\nDavid W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Fran, just a quick housekeeping item. I think this quarter you said that Wireline margins in the second half would be higher than the first half. Is that the same thing as what you said last quarter that Wireline margins would be up year-over-year, just to clarify? And then, the upgrade rate fell from 8% in 1Q to 7% in 2Q and obviously that\u2019s a big swing factor for margins, almost 200 basis points. Have you think for the rest of the year and maybe as a run rate as a function of the actions that you\u2019ve taken for upgrades, how do you think about that 7% upgrade rate as a baseline as a driver of margins through the rest of the year, and maybe just generally going forward? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Sure. Thanks, David. So on the Wireline margins, look, we are very, very solid on improving our Wireline margin here in the second half, first the first half. I think that given some of the cost structure issues that we have, especially around the contract, we think that we can still improve our margins. If we can get to a better [inhere] with the contract, then I think that we can actually improve our margins on a year-over-year basis, but that will come down to a timing issue. I do think, though, that when we\u2019re focusing on the consumer side of the house, as I said, I\u2019m very confident that we can double our revenue growth here. We are very focused in on the profitability of FiOS. The profitability increase in Wireline this quarter was really centered around the FiOS, really progress that we made on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think we have a lot of good things here, and we\u2019ll just have to play this out, but we\u2019re very, very confident that we\u2019ll improve our wireline margins here. On the upgrade side of the house, obviously this is timing a lot of things go into play here. We\u2019ve made a lot of moves in the last year and a half around restructuring our upgrade policies. As you know, we\u2019ve launched our $30 upgrade fee. Obviously, this all has an impact on the level of upgrades and then of course, there is always that Rumour Mill out there with a new phone coming out in the fourth quarter. And so people maybe waiting, but look, we manage this on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I think, the way I look at this though going into the back half of this year on the upgrades is that, we\u2019ll manage this business on a profit and on a growth trajectory. And if you think about what wireless has done when we get to the fourth quarter. We will have taken $5 billion out of our cost structure in the last three years, which is why we can generate margins of 49%, which beat our all-time high from last year. So I think that wireless has a very good track record in history to deliver both on profitability and growth.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, David. Brad, we will move on.\nDavid W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Fran.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities: Hey, guys, thanks. If I maybe just a little bit deeper dive on that thought process, and we obviously with some new policies in place and relatively lower upgrades. We might not see the same pattern, we saw last year and last year, we all remember that people were waiting for the iPhone in Q4, so Q3 margins were super high. Should we not expect that same dynamic given the changes in policies? And then secondly, on the FiOS side, when you talk about profitability, is this on a per subscriber basis or just slowing down overall growth adds, and should \u2013 we will not be making a margin sacrifice to take share here? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks, Mike. So just a couple of things on the margin side of the half. So I mean, I think, again, I\u2019ll just repeat what I said is, we\u2019ll manage this business both on a growth and profitability perspective for wireless, and I think we\u2019ve proven that. look I mean, obviously the fourth quarter is always a seasonable volume quarter for the industry, and I expect that to happen again with the holiday season that\u2019s coming up. So it will really factoring on the volumes that what new devices, and I\u2019m sure, we\u2019re going to have plenty of new devices that come up between now and the holiday season. and if you look at phone to device side of the house, we just launched the Samsung Galaxy 3 on our 4G LTE network. And it proved the point that when we launch a very technical phone that\u2019s great when appearance and viability that people accept that phone, and that phone is selling extremely well. So all these factors come into play, but I think that we are very, very confident that what we laid out in January of 2011 regardless of what phones come, what phones don\u2019t come, and what kind of a season it will be, we will hit our financial objectives. On the FiOS side of the house, as I said, we did have some seasonality pressure here, but look, we have to balance the perspective; most of you\u2019d look at our wireless portfolio. we have to balance the consumer wireline portfolio in the same fashion. we have to balance growth with revenue acceleration and improving profitability. and that\u2019s what we\u2019re set out to do, and we\u2019ll make the decisions in the right ones to in order to achieve all three of those metrics.\nMichael McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities: Great, thanks Fran.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Mike. Brad, can we take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities:\n :\nFrancis J. Shammo: Sure. Thanks, Brett. On the vote of our dividends the board meets on a quarterly basis and in each \u2013 the partnership agreements specifically states that on an annual basis the dividend will be reviewed at the end of the year. So that\u2019s really all there is to say on that. On the 700 A and B megahertz sale, as you know, we\u2019ve already hired a third-party, we are ready to go as soon as we get approval on the SpectrumCo deal. So, this is going to be an immediate thing, not something that\u2019s going to take a while. So we are really setup to go and it will be as fast as we can get the auction done, and make sure that we get a price that we believe is fair, and then we will sell the spectrum. So that\u2019s the timeline.\nBrett Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: Great, thanks for that.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Brett. And just an update \u2013 I continue to get updates on the IR related \u2013 website related issue. We continue to work it. We should have all documents available very shortly for those that couldn\u2019t get them. Brad, right now, it looks like we have time for two more questions. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Seitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nThomas Seitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Fran, you mentioned you\u2019re accelerating a bit the copper shutdown., in the past, you\u2019ve mentioned that a gating factor was regulatory approval to shutting down the copper plant for those that wanted circuit switched lines. I\u2019m wondering if there has been any sort of change in the local regulatory environment that allows you to accelerate that? And then secondly, I think in the past you\u2019ve mentioned the shutdowns would be in the hundreds of thousands, is that materially going up? And is that a thing where you\u2019d sacrifice a bit of margin and maybe spend a bit more CapEx to accelerate this process.\nFrancis J. Shammo:  Okay. So on the copper shutdown piece, over the past few years we have gotten a lot of regulatory release in a lot of states on copper being the provider of last resort and those types of things. So as we go here and through our product rationalization, we are moving as quickly as we possibly can in shutting down that copper plant and obviously we did that in Dallas a year ago and we currently have one we\u2019re running in Florida that we\u2019re shutting the switch. So we continue down that path and we\u2019re doing that as quickly as possible, and as I said, from a FiOS to copper migration, or a copper to FiOS migration, we nearly double the amount of migrations that we did, and so we\u2019re being as aggressive as we possibly can in these areas. So from that perspective I think we\u2019re right on track.\nThomas Seitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: Okay. Thank you.\nFrancis J. Shammo:  Thanks, Tom. Brad, let\u2019s take our last question please.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital:  Thank you. Your investment in Italy was, I think, you said a $0.02 drag on EPS this quarter. How should we think about the impact over the next few quarters, and can you talk about what the strategic importance of your Italian asset and that is this going to a be drag, why not try to dispose it?\nFrancis J. Shammo: I think that given the pressures that we\u2019re seeing in Europe it\u2019s not unforeseen that there would be a pressure there in the Omnitel market of Italy. And what we\u2019re seeing is that that created a $0.02 pressure on a year-over-year basis. Strategically, I\u2019m not going to discuss whether we\u2019re going to stay a partner or not a partner, but right now it is a strategic asset for us to be a partner.\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital:  And you think that $0.02 drag will continue over the next few quarters, will it get worse, how should we model it?\nFrancis J. Shammo:  I think it will be pretty consistent.\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital: Okay.\nJohn N. Doherty:  Okay. thanks, Kevin. Brad, that concludes our call. Thanks everybody, we appreciate you dialing in this morning and once again, we\u2019re doing everything we can to work on the IR related \u2013 website related issue we had this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. I'd like to state that all quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Also, there were no special items of nonoperational nature included in our reported results for the first quarter, of either this year or last. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our first quarter results. On our last earnings call in January, I talked about the confidence we have in our ability to benefit from the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. With the results of our first quarter, we continue to execute and deliver on the guidance we gave back in January of 2011 and reaffirmed earlier this year. We remain as confident in the direction of our business now as we were then, and we continue to deliver strong results. Earnings per share were $0.59, up 15.7% over first quarter last year. In Wireless, we saw a sharp acceleration of growth in retail service revenue and postpaid ARPU, driven by increased smartphone penetration and higher data device adoption, resulting in increased usage. This top line growth, combined with effective cost management, resulted in a very strong service EBITDA margin. Consumer retail revenue growth also continues to improve, driven by another solid quarter of FiOS performance. Our broadband net adds were the highest we have seen in nearly 3 years. We had an extremely strong quarter of cash generation. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is more than 3.5x the amount generated a year ago. The first quarter is normally the lowest quarter of the year, so we expect to see increasing free cash flow levels going forward. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were down more than 18% as our disciplined approach is resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4. Our consolidated results show strong growth this quarter. On the top line, our growth trends continue to be very positive, coming from all strategic areas, most notably, Wireless services. This quarter, overall revenue growth far outweighed the increase in operating expenses, resulting in double-digit operating income growth of 16.7%. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.2 billion, and our margin expanded to 32.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 210 basis points sequentially. Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $1.7 billion, driven by reduced levels of capital spending and an 18% increase in cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $3.6 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $800 million compared to last year. Our overall capital efficiency continued to show steady improvement. We expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline for the full year based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending. In Wireless, capital spending in the quarter was $1.9 billion, which was lower by $850 million or 31% from the first quarter last year. You will recall that at this time last year, we were spending more to meet 3G capacity requirements in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. As we move through the year, you will see a continued focus on migrating traffic from 3G to 4G LTE, which will drive additional improvements in our capital and operating efficiency. We will also continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation. In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion this quarter, about 5% higher than the first quarter last year. This increase is due to timing, strategic spending in enterprise and some copper-to-fiber migration within our residential customer base. Our balance sheet remains very strong. You will recall that the $10 billion cash distribution from Verizon Wireless was paid this quarter. We used our proportionate share and part to pay down commercial paper and to redeem a maturing bond. As a result, total debt declined by $3.6 billion since the end of last year. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.3x at the end of the quarter. Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business had an impressive quarter and a strong start to the year, posting accelerated growth in service revenue and our highest retail postpaid ARPU accretion in 3 years. Total Wireless revenues of $18.3 billion grew 8.2% and now represent about 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. Retail service revenue growth accelerated to 8.9%, 110 basis point increase in growth from the fourth quarter and the highest growth rate we've seen since early 2009. We are seeing strong revenue growth from multiple postpaid sources: Smartphones, tablets and Internet devices. And retail prepaid revenue grew strongly again this quarter, up 17.3%. Total service revenue grew 7.7% this quarter, 130 basis points higher than the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Total data revenue of $6.6 billion grew 21.1%. Data now represents nearly 43% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continues to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 36%. Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices. With the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading $93 million retail connections, 88 million postpaid and 5 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 734,000 new retail net connections, 501,000 postpaid and 233,000 prepaid. Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd point out that within the prepaid net adds, 138,000 were tablets. About 60% of the prepaid tablets this quarter were 4G LTE. Within the retail postpaid category, gross additions were just over 3 million, down about 12% from a year ago. We believe this decline is both seasonal and a function of the timing of the new device launches last year. Our porting ratios with all carriers are favorable, and our postpaid churn metrics remain excellent. Although the first to report, we are confident that our 501,000 postpaid net adds is a strong result. Postpaid device sales, both gross adds and upgrades, totaled about 10 million this quarter with 8% of our postpaid base upgrading devices. In addition to smartphones, we are also having great success in the Internet device category, which includes tablets. This quarter, we sold 765,000 4G LTE Internet devices, which is more than last quarter. We are the market leader in this space as mobile hotspots or Jetpacks, USB modems and tablets represent 8% of our retail postpaid connections. I would also point out that 62% of our active tablet base is postpaid. Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at our smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 47%. 72% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones. We sold 3.2 million Apple iPhones and sold 2.1 million 4G LTE smartphones this quarter. We sold 500,000 or 30% more 4G LTE smartphones this quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, about 20% of our smartphone sales are gross adds or new to Verizon, and the rest are upgrades from our existing customer base. Within these upgrades, 42% are customers buying a smartphone for the first time, representing incremental recurring data revenue. This is a significant point of differentiation and a strength for us. Retail postpaid ARPU was $55.43 this quarter, up 3.6%. This is a big acceleration in accretion over what we experienced in 2011. Growth in retail postpaid phone ARPU accelerated to 4.9% this quarter and now exceeds $57. Postpaid Internet device ARPU was about $48 this quarter, a decline of 8.7% from last year but an improvement from an 11% year-over-year decline last quarter. Although postpaid ARPU for Internet devices is less than for phones, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by increased unit sales. We already have a majority share in this important category, and we continue to expand the market for devices, which enable higher usage. We also expect more network efficiency as an increasing percentage of data traffic moves to our 4G LTE network. Let's turn to Slide 9, as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 230 markets and more than 200 million POPs, covering over 2/3 of the country. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We are seeing increasing customer awareness of the capabilities of 4G LTE and a growing recognition of the superior performance of smartphones, tablets and Internet devices on the Verizon 4G LTE network. Third-party comparisons of our 4G LTE network performance compared with others generally ranks us highest in terms of consistency of access, performance and speed, with better average download speeds and significantly higher average upload speed. In addition to our network deployment and coverage advantage, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. In the first quarter, we sold 2.9 million postpaid smartphones and Internet devices, a 22% increase over the fourth quarter. The vast majority of devices we have for sale are 4G LTE. We now have a total of 8 million 4G LTE customer connections, representing 9% of our postpaid base. Of note, about 2/3 of these are smartphones. We remain very pleased by our 4G LTE progress. The Verizon 4G LTE network has become the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward. Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the first quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of EBITDA, which is an increase of 14.2%, and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 410 basis points sequentially to 46.3%. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our ability to execute very well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of accelerating service revenue and ARPU growth, and intense focus on cost controls and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance. Going forward, we will continue to look at opportunities to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies and commissions. We have identified $2 billion of cost saving opportunities for this year, and we are on track to capture these savings. We also announced the $30 upgrade fee, which will go into effect next week. Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total Wireline revenue declined $202 million or 2% in the first quarter. About 60% of this decline is a result of targeted product rationalization actions we have taken to improve the quality of our revenue mix. Within wholesale, I'm referring to our continued exit from unprofitable international wholesale routes and contracts. In Enterprise, it is our deemphasis on selling of drop ship hardware or CPE. And the other revenue line item, the majority of the 82 million decline this quarter was from nonstrategic products, which include the former MCI mass markets business, long-distance, local wholesale and calling cards, public pay phones and directory assistance. We are exiting the calling card and public payphone businesses entirely. While the Wireline revenue decline was accentuated by these targeted actions this quarter, growth in the strategic areas continues to mitigate the more secular and cyclical declines in other parts of the business. As we have stated, we are taking a hard look at all of our product lines and rationalizing those that are not meeting our strategic and financial requirements. For example, going forward, we will no longer be selling high-speed Internet or DSL over copper in areas where FiOS is available. From a profitability perspective, first quarter EBITDA declined by $148 million year-over-year with 100 basis point decline in the EBITDA margin to 22.6%. The decline is due to several factors, revenue declines in less-strategic products and first quarter cost pressures like higher OPEB accruals, increased active benefit cost and escalators in certain content contracts. We have targeted price actions planned to help offset certain cost increases, which will contribute to our overall profitability goals this year. I remain confident that we will achieve EBITDA margin improvement for the full year, and we continue to be very focused on improving the long-term profitability of the Wireline business. Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12. As a result of the scale of FiOS and increased penetration, consumer ARPU has continued to steadily increase and is now over $97, up 8%. In addition, our residential connections trends continued to improve. We lost 205,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.8% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 289,000 or 8.6% at this time last year. In the first quarter, we delivered strong broadband growth, gaining a total of 104,000 net subscribers. With a 193,000 FiOS Internet additions, we passed the 5 million FiOS subscriber mark and increased our penetration to 36.4%. More than half our FiOS customers already use 20 megabit speed or higher. And with more devices like tablets, game consoles and smart TVs connecting to the Internet at home, demand for higher broadband speeds is on the rise. Later this year, we plan to introduce a series of higher speed packages that will further differentiate FiOS as the nation's fastest Internet service and allow us to continue to monetize our investment in the FiOS platform. In FiOS Video, we added 180,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.4 million and increasing our penetration to 32.3%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 68% are triple-play, and our FiOS ARPU now stands that more than $148 per month. Our focus continues to be on increasing FiOS penetration, realizing additional operating and capital efficiencies and expanding margins. Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Strategic Services continue to drive the overall positive growth in Global Enterprise revenue. We continue to post double-digit growth in application services like managed network, data center, security, cloud and IT infrastructure. Within the IP layer, private IP and Ethernet services are contributing to the growth. In the first quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 11.6%, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services did outpace the decline in core Enterprise Services but not to the same degree. As you might expect, we are experiencing some short-term revenue pressure from Europe and foreign-currency. In addition, our deemphasis on sale of hardware was worth about $43 million on a year-over-year basis. Growth in services revenue was 2.3%. Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability. Our strategic repositioning of Verizon Enterprise Solutions has better aligned our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. Our acquisitions of best-in-class assets like Cybertrust, Terremark and CloudSwitch, combined with our industry-leading 4G LTE and global IP networks, gives us a unique platform of assets to provide comprehensive, integrated solutions to enterprise organizations. In Global Wholesale, revenues in the first quarter declined $181 million or 8.9% due primarily to declines in voice and local services. As I said, we continue to take targeted actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts, to improve the quality of our revenue mix during this period of secular decline and lower volumes. Partly offsetting these declines were continued growth in certain data services, most notably, fiber-based Ethernet. Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, we had a solid start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see and our key strategic growth areas. We are on track with our plans, and we expect to continue to deliver strong results going forward. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. Our success in stimulating top line growth and capturing cost savings will enable us to mitigate certain secular declines and cost pressures. In terms of recent news, yesterday, we announced plans to conduct an open sale process for all of our 700 megahertz A and B Spectrum licenses in order to rationalize our Spectrum holdings. We acquired these licenses as part of the FCC auction 73 in 2008. The sale of this license is contingent upon the close of the purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless. These transactions are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice and are expected to close by mid-summer. In closing, I'd reemphasize that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the investments we've made, further improving investment returns and creating significant shareholder value in the years to come. With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can get to your questions.\nJohn N. Doherty: Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Fran, a couple of questions. First on the Wireless ARPU, very healthy uptick in the retail postpaid growth rate. Can you help us think through prospects for further improvement in the rate of growth from here? And then second question just on Wireline margins, I think the reset in the first quarter was a bit larger than most of us had initially expected sort of going into the process. You talked about confidence in improvement from here. Just wondering how should we think about the pacing of this through the year? Would you expect it to be fairly linear and show up in the second quarter results or is this more back-end loaded, maybe contingent on a union contract?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So let's start. These are 2 actually big questions, and that probably will result in larger answers than you would expect. But on Wireless ARPU, let's start out with the fact that I think as we started out in 2011, we said that we had a path to accelerate the growth of our revenue. We came out of the fourth quarter, I reiterated my confidence on that projection. And as I sit here today and I will continue to reiterate that we are confident that we will continue to accelerate our growth in this category. And it's going to come from many, many different areas. So you have to keep in mind, number one, our smartphone penetration is at 47%, which means that there are 53% of our phone customers that are still on a basic phone. So we still have a lot of roadway here from a basic to smart upgrade. And as you know, 42% of our customers this quarter went from a basic phone into a smartphone category, so that is accelerating the growth. In addition, as you heard on the script, our Internet device category is starting to stabilize a bit, and we expect that to continue to go throughout the quarter on an ARPU basis. As last year, we reset prices, we expanded the category, so the growth of that category is expanding for us, but we knew we had some short-term ARPU pressure by the price resets that we launched into the marketplace. But that set us up for our 4G LTE launches. And as you saw, we had a stellar performance on a number of devices that we moved on our 4G network this quarter. So that's a couple of things. I probably could go into a lot more detail around our data sharing plans, our commercial launch of Fusion and if we want to get to more discussion on that, we can. But we are very, very confident that we are on a path to continue to accelerate the growth of our ARPU. On Wireline margins, just a couple of things here, too, to talk to. So number one, we did have the FiOS-to-copper migration, which impacted our short-term results but we've talked that this is a strategy that we're deploying. It is better for us long-term to get most of these customers off of our copper network to our FiOS network. As you saw that we are -- stopped selling our naked DSL in FiOS covered area and we started to convert a number of customers in this quarter over to our FiOS network from a voice perspective. Now a couple of things here that this will launch, number one, we will see a long-term benefit in our repairs and maintenance decrease over time. We will also get the upsell capability to start selling these voice customers on better speeds of FiOS and better experience. And also then into the linear TV product that we have to offer. And what we're seeing is the minimum number that we converted last year during our trials, we're starting to see a 30% sale upgrade on those customers, but it does take us 3 to 6 months to convince those customers to upgrade. So this is a longer-term type strategy. In addition, going into the future, you're going to see, you may have already saw, that we are starting to do some price-ups in strategic areas. We've also started that in April but over the next 2 quarters, we're going to have several priced-ups in our FiOS packages. In addition, we're going to rebundle certain of our packages to better bundle our content in order to make it more profitable based on the Tier that you picked for us. The other thing is that there's other revenue streams coming from down the pipe like home monitoring control that will contribute to the overall ARPU of our FiOS platform. We also have a very disciplined cost structure in place. As you see that, we declined our SG&A expense year-over-year. In April, we also had another ISP [ph] to our represented employees, which we had a number of people take. So we've already taken off 1,100 people from payroll since the quarter has closed. We are taking other measures around the consolidation of our back office operations, as I've talked to in the past. You see that we are exiting some of our unprofitable or low-margin businesses, which will help us in the future. And then, of course, the union contract and we can talk more about that. But obviously, the business needs a cost restructure and that's what that is about. So I'll stop there, I'm sure we'll have some more questions here.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Fran, is there any way you could quantify the copper-to-fiber sort of incremental cost in the quarter?\nFrancis J. Shammo: At this point, we're not going to disclose that. It did result in some incremental capital for prepositioning and then it did the result in some expense for us. But actually for this quarter, it was not a big component of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First, just 2 quick ones. First, on, I guess a follow-up on the Wireless side. You saw 260 basis points of annual margin improvement in the first quarter. And now talking about accelerating ARPU growth and like you said, the $30 that gets started gets tagged onto upgrades in May. I mean, is that a decent number or, I guess, why shouldn't we expect that kind of year-over-year increase in margins or maybe even better as the $30 starts to flow-through? And then, second of all, maybe on use of cash, could you remind us what your target leverage ratio is. We're at the, I guess, 1.3 now given that debt pay down. As we look out to next year and we're modeling another dividend, obviously you don't want to chat and you don't want to sort of look that far out, but I'm just trying to get a sense for the use of cash as we go forward?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Okay, so, on the Wireless margin expansion. I guess there's a couple of things here that are important. Number one is, as you know, we have been on a 2-year track here to reduce expenses in our Wireless unit. And over the last 2 years, we've taken out about $3 billion of expense. This year, we have another target of $2 billion. So I know that everyone is focused in on the subsidy model, but as I've said, that's just one line item in our P&L, and it takes managing the entire business to be an efficient business. And I think that Wireless has done a really excellent job on reduction of cost and creating more efficiency within the model. And that's what's driving the margins, beside the ARPU increases that you see in the revenue growth. And as we stated last year coming into this year, that our goal was to get back to our third quarter level of last year's margin and then continue to grow from there, and we're putting in all those actions to do that. As far as the $30 upgrade fee, I'll remind everyone that we started back in 2010 on a strategy to start to take out some of the lucrative promotions we had around upgrades by deleting the New Every Two program, limiting the amount of early upgrades that we allowed. And now the implementation of the $30 upgrade fee, which we were the last carrier to implement. But it's important, too, for the overall profitability of the business, and the experience that we expect to have within this business. So I think there's a number of actions that Wireless is taking to continue to focus on the ARPU expansion and then the margin expansion because we like to do both at Verizon, we grow and we expand our margins. And then as far as the use of cash here, on a targeted net debt-to-EBITDA. It's more important that I think we're comfortable with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This will improve over time as we continue to delever in certain areas where we think it's reasonable to do. You saw us take the proceeds of the Wireless dividend this quarter to pay down some debt that was maturing that was high-interest debt that, quite honestly, didn't make sense at this time to refinance in any perspective. So we will continue to manage our cash. Important, our dividend policy is extremely important to us, and Lowell and I have said very strongly that we will continue to the policy of our dividend. So I'll stop there, and we'll go on to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You talked about the Wireline margins and I think there was a question about the union contract. Could you give us an update on where you stand and the ability -- if it's just been moved forward and get progress, some agreement over the coming quarters? And then on Wireless adds, you had I'm sure the best in the industry, but overall, we expect the industry to be flat to down on postpaid. Do you sense this is just a lull post the iPhone 4S launch last quarter? Did to see a sort of a pickup sequentially through the quarter, any thoughts about how the rest of the quarters pan out in terms of Wireless versus Q1?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So first let's talk about the union contract. So look, I think it's safe to say that as we entered into this new negotiation, we knew that this is going to be an extremely difficult negotiation. We have said very strongly that we need cost structure within the Wireline business. Obviously, if you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased. And this cost structure is not palatable going forward. So we need to some concessions, we need health care contributions. We need some pension revisions. And look, were not asking for things that have not already been given to other companies. These are not new issues. They've already been given to some of our peer companies. So we are standing strong. We need this cost restructure in order to build on the profitability of our Wireline unit. The other thing is, look, we've invested over $24 billion into this unit on the FiOS platform. And in order for us to be competitive with our competitors of cable who don't have these very lucrative benefits and average salaries of $90,000 with an incremental $50,000 of healthcare and pension on top of that, we need some cost restructure here. So look, this is a hard negotiation. It took one of our peer companies over 500 days to get to where they were, 3 years ago in some of these breakthrough issues. So we continue to negotiate. We continue to put proposals on and we'll see where we go, but we knew this was going to be a long haul. And with my comment of improvement of Wireline margins, it's all built in those comments. On the Wireless adds, I think we're extremely pleased with the growth of our Wireless business on an add basis. If you look at, though there's going to be other categories that drive the growth of Wireless in the future, as I said, we will be launching our data share plan in mid-summer this year. We believe that, that plan, the way we have it designed, will enable our customers to easily connect other devices to that plan. And I think that as we do more connections, you notice that we did not disclose total connections. As I've said that machine-to-machine is becoming a more complicated device and connection of the way the plans are built, so it's not important anymore of total connections. It's more important of our revenue increase based on the customers that we're growing. I think that if you look at our Fusion product that we just launched in certain states, our trials are going very well. The customers' experience is extremely strong. We had a target of 10 million homes that we're going to launch to in May, of this year, when we commercially launch. And that we'll build to, as we build out the 4G LTE footprint to a target of 34 million homes. We believe that's a growth engine for us in the future. Then we have tablets, we have prepaid. This is the second quarter in a row where we've grown our prepaid base with our Unleashed product. And in the next week or so, you're going to see us add in a smartphone to our prepaid product on an $80 price point with 1 gigabit of data. So there's a number of actions that we're taking. If you think about the third ecosystem and then also the cable partnership that we also just launched some new markets with Time Warner cable this past quarter, Kansas, Ohio and Carolinas. So we've continue to expand. I think we have a growth rate test to increase adds on a full year basis here, and we're on that track.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMC.\nPhilip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So 2 questions, we'll see how I do. So first on the prepaid, tablets were up little bit, and I wonder if you saw a little bit of a drag even though from the timing of the iPad launch and if things have got a little better since things -- since that's come through? And then second, we've been getting a lot of questions about your ability to control iPhone subsidies. And maybe you can help us out a little bit. It seems like the way you control costs, some [indiscernible] raising upgrade rates, some sort of pushing back on timing rather than cutting down on the actual subsidy of that device, is there a level of control you have on those subsidies over time or are you pretty much stuck with the way things are priced today?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So first on prepaid tablets. It's a great point. We did see a slowdown in the beginning of the quarter on the anticipation of the iPad 4G LTE device coming to market. And as you know, that was only about 2, 2.5 weeks of product in the marketplace. And we saw significant volume previous to any volume that we had previously seen on tablet sales. So I think that going to the second quarter, that volume will continue. So yes, there was a little bit of a downward demand in the beginning, waiting for the new iPad to come out. So again, I think we're off to a good start. We sold 390,000 tablets in the quarter. And as we said, bulk of them were -- 60% were increase in tablet sales year-over-year. So I think going into the future, tablets will continue to be a very strategic segment of our business. On the Apple iPhone, look, I think as I've said before, we look at every individual handset, we have a broad portfolio. We manage it by handset-by-handset and manage our subsidy and again, that's just one aspect of our P&L. And this is just a nature of this business that's grown from the beginning of the industry that we subsidize handsets. I do think though it is important that there is a third ecosystem that's brought into the mix here. And we are fully supportive of that with Microsoft, and as we said that we created the Android platform from beginning. And it is an incredible platform today that we helped to create. And we're looking to do the same thing with a third ecosystem. So that's how I think that we plan to go into the future here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Real quick. Could we just get an update on the net debt at the Wireless level? And then taking a step back, could we get an update on what's happening in enterprise with the VDMS strategy that you're trying to rollout and then anything else in terms of demand that you're seeing on video and how that's helping your enterprise business?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So on the net debt for wireless, we have gross debt of $10.9 billion, cash on hand of $4.4 billion, so net debt is $6.4 billion. On the enterprise, VDMS, think we're making great progress with the new organization and the umbrella organization that John Stratton has over both Wireless and Wireline from an enterprise perspective. We have gone very deep into verticals. We see that there is, and if you paid attention to Lowell's remarks here recently at the healthcare forum, we see a lot of healthcare opportunity and are engaging in a lot of partnerships to extend what we think is a really good product set on the reduction of overall healthcare costs in the nation, but also to deliver some really neat innovation-type ideas into the future of healthcare and how we manage that from an enterprise perspective. As far as overall growth of the segment, we did see a decline this quarter in Europe. It was not expected. Just to give you some baseline here, last year, our European market was growing on average about 13%. It contributes about $450 million of revenue per quarter. We saw that drop to flat this quarter. So there was a drastic pullback in our European market. We don't believe that, that is long-term. We think that that's more of a short-term issue. We already started to see some increased bookings here exiting the first quarter, but that probably won't turn into revenue for 3 to 6 months. As you know, this industry is a longer-term type recording from the time that you get an order. But I think this is a short-term issue for us, but it did put an impact on our overall growth. Now having said that, our cloud services and our strategic nature of our security are those portfolios are growing well. Our overall cloud portfolio grew by 17% quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So I think we're making progress in the area that we want to make progress in, but again, the portfolio rationalization is also creating a drag here. And as we continue down that path, we will lose some revenue in those less-profitable platforms that we really want to discontinue investing in, but it's for the betterment of us and betterment of our customers to move them to a more highly innovative platform. And then the last thing, of course, is the development and launch that we did last June of our VDMS platform, and we will be launching our next phase of that come this June, and we expect to see some growth revenue acceleration from that platform as we go here. So there's a number of things that John is implementing that I think will contribute. As I said in my script here, the -- contribute of the future growth of the overall Wireline, revenue top line and margin growth.\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And Fran, if I could follow up one more thing, what pushed Verizon Wireless over the edge to put the Spectrum up for sale? Can you just address a little bit of the background to yesterday's announcement?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, so thanks for that question and I think this is an example where people write articles where they don't have facts. So let's talk about the facts. So number one, I think Verizon Wireless has shown over time that they are very, very good stewards of Spectrum and efficient Spectrum. And we are responsible and efficient owners of the Spectrum. And as a company policy, we will not hoard the Spectrum. Now when we bought this back in 2008, obviously, we did not have the foresight to know that we would have an opportunity to acquire AWS Spectrum from the cable company. And if you look at our Spectrum holdings, we purchased the 700 megahertz, which is an extremely efficient and this is where we built our LTE platform on. And then we had the AWS spectrum in the East, which was very efficient from an overbuild perspective on capacity of our LTE platform. And now with the deal that we have with SpectrumCo, we believe that is the most efficient for us to utilize and build out our LTE platform. So hence, the lower 700 megahertz A and B does not fit as nicely into our Spectrum holdings as it may for others. But we think it's the prudent thing to do, to sell these licenses off to the rest of the industry for the benefit of their customers and to enhance their ability to build out 4G LTE. So I think we would say that we're being good stewards. This has nothing to do -- we did not just wake up yesterday and decide we were going to sell Spectrum because we ran into a roadblock at the FCC. That is continuing. We have facts that say the 180-day clock is going and that we are still very confident that we will get approval for the AWS acquisition from SpectrumCo. But just the 2 other points I want to make here is, number one, this is contingent on us getting the a getting the AWS Spectrum approved because, obviously, we would need this spectrum if that's not approved and again, we think it's the right thing for the FCC and maybe a standard for them to use in the future of how Spectrum should be allocated out and sold and efficient ownership and protocols. The other thing is I think there were some articles written that this is going to be a fire sale. This is nothing near a fire sale. We bought this Spectrum back in 2008. We've had carrying costs, and we will be prudent to our shareholders to make sure we get the return our investments. We know what the value of this Spectrum is in the free market, and obviously, we're going to an auction to allow many different parties to participate through a third-party auctioneer. And look, if we don't get the price that we think is a fair price, then we won't go through with the sale, and that's at our discretion. So I think there's some important facts and I'll stop there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDavid W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just maybe a couple of follow-ups. Just first, Fran, on the AWS Spectrum approvals, is there a level of divestitures that the FCC could come up with that will be a deal breaker from your perspective or is just getting kind of any magnitude of an AWS deal done sufficient? And then with respect to the Wireless margin, you're targeting $2 billion of cost cuts, I guess, for the year. If you could kind of share with us where we wound up after the end of first quarter on that? And then the last one, if I could, is just, could you kind of give us an update on what, if any, results have you been able to generate from your partnership with the cable companies on the selling of a joint product that have been material to the business?\nFrancis J. Shammo: So first on the AWS approval, I think that we're exactly where we expected to be. The conversations are going exactly the way we thought. I'm not going to speculate on caps or what we would do, what we wouldn't do and I think what I'll say is, look, we're exactly where we thought we would be and I think we'll close this transaction by mid-summer. On the $2 billion Wireless cost cutting ideas, I think we've shown that we are very good executioners on the cost-cutting routines of $3 billion in the last 2 years. The $2 billion is a combination of a variety of things. You saw the announcement of some call center rationalization. Obviously, part of this $2 billion is to work on the reduction of our subsidies, and you saw -- you're already seeing some of these plans go into action with our upgrade feesand some other things. So there's a wide wrath of cost-cutting initiatives that Dan, me and his team are executing on. And right now coming out of the first quarter, we're actually right on track where we expected to be. And then lastly, on the cable companies, obviously, we're still in a trial mode. We're working out the kinks. We launched a couple markets here with Comcast up in Seattle and Portland. We just launched a couple of new markets with Time Warner cable. So I think it's too early to talk about this one. The agreements are still in front of the DOJ and the FCC and we continue to cooperate with them. And we'll wait till the transaction closes and get up full to speed and then we'll talk about that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.\nTimothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Fran, 2 questions, if you don't mind. On the enterprise business, on the core business, could you just give us maybe a little color around -- it sounds like you're seeing volumes are fine and you haven't really seen a pickup in competition. But obviously, these peripheral legacy products are in decline. I just want to make sure that's kind of what you're saying. And maybe, did you see any seasonality in core enterprise that you see maybe lower sales in December and that's kind of picked up. I know you kind of talked about Europe a little bit, but maybe just here in the U.S.? And then I just have a CapEx follow-up.\nFrancis J. Shammo: As far as enterprise goes, look, I think the enterprise business is in our Strategic Services area. It's steady as she goes. We're growing that portfolio. And look, any time ago through a massive restructure like John has implemented at VES with going into more of a vertical-type segment, you're going to have a little disruption within your frontline sales force and I think we saw that. But that was like a 60- to 90-day interruption and I think we're getting back on pace and we expect enterprise to start to get back on their feet here going into the second quarter and through the year. And as far as the core side goes, the core is just steady as she goes. It's a declining business. People are moving away from the legacy voice and long distance and moving more into the IP technology. And this is where we have several of our customer [indiscernible] still on the legacy core platforms that we need to move off of so that we can stop investing in those platforms and get them to something that is more innovative and more efficient for them as a company as well. And I don't think they're surprised with the conversations that we're having. So I think as we go here, this will be a steady course. And as we said before, our goal is to be a gross national product-type growth here, GDP plus type organization. So I think that's we're striving for and that's what's John is striving for as well.\nTimothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: So just on enterprises, sounds like you're really trying to accelerate the conversion over. How much longer do you think that would take?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Well, I think this is going to be some of these legacy-type platforms. This could be a 2-year transition.\nTimothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And then CapEx, is flattish a good number for the full year versus last year? I know even with a decline it was a percentage of revenue at a fairly healthy pace given what we're seeing in Wireless.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, I've said that the guidance would be -- we wouldn't give specific guidance but flat is a good guidance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities.\nMichael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Fran, could you just make a comment on the ARPU side? Obviously, pretty strong performance on the wireless ARPU. But it looked like voice, the headwind on voice sort of became less of a headwind this quarter. Pretty good improvement on the rate of decline. Is what you're seeing there, whether it's people just not pricing that down anymore or what behaviors the consumers are showing you? And then just a couple on the housecleaning side, on Wireless D&A, looks like it was down sequentially. I was just wondering if there was a change in assumption there? And then on the Wireline margin commentary, the better year-over-year I'm assuming that's on a reported basis.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, so Mike, just a couple of things here on the voice and text messaging. Our messaging revenue actually grew 4% again year-over-year. So we're not seeing what others in the international market have seen. And again, it all comes down to the way you package the bundle and we still have a majority of our customers taking a bundled package of voice and text along with their data plan. So we're starting to see that -- that starting to flatten out perspective. But look, I mean, we keep our eye on this, and with 4G LTE and VoLTE coming at the end of this year into next year, there will be additional opportunities to convert more revenue from our voice products as we launch into more, if you will, IP-type videoconferencing and so forth. As far as Verizon Wireless depreciation and amortization, look, at the beginning of every year, we have a policy that we look at our asset base and reevaluate all of our estimated lives on all of our asset bases. And sometimes make decisions to accelerate and sometimes we make decisions to reevaluate the lives that we have in a certain asset. And we've done that this year as we do every year, and in Verizon Wireless, there was a life extension on our entire EV-DO platform. But this is nothing unusual that we normally don't do. And so that's the answer to that one.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just to come back to the CapEx statement. In order for your CapEx to be flattish over the course of the year, it would seem like the spending would have to pick up a little bit in Wireless. First of all, is that the correct conclusion? And if so, what would be behind that? And then the second question is to clarify a statement you made about margins. Fran, you mentioned sort of getting to the third quarter of last year Wireless EBITDA margin, that was just inside 48%. Is that a point you think you can achieve once again at some quarter during the year or is that actually a full year target for Verizon Wireless?\nFrancis J. Shammo: I mean, as far as -- these are both guidance-type questions so I'm not going to get into the specifics of them. So look, we said we'll be flat at CapEx and let's leave it at that. I'm not going to get to the individual components or quarter-by-quarter. And then on the Wireless margins, I've said that, look, our goal is to get back to our 3Q margin and we'll strive to get there.\nJohn N. Doherty: That concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conferencing Services. You may now disconnect."}], "2014": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2013, "date": "2014-01-21 11:05:05", "content": "Executives: Michael Stefanski - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Fran Shammo - Chief Financial Officer \nAnalysts:  John Hodulik - UBS Phil Cusick - JPMorgan Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank David Barden - Bank of America Mike McCormack - Jefferies John Mark Warren - Morgan Stanley Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Joe Mastrogiovanni - Credit Suisse Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo \nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. \nMichael Stefanski: Thanks Evan. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement and other legends on slides two and three. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I would like to cover a few special items that are included in our reported results. These are displayed on Slide 4. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.76 per share on a GAAP basis. This includes several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight. The largest item is a pre-tax gain of $6 billion related to the year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This favorable accounting adjustment is primarily non-cash and is caused by an increase in the discount rate, changes in actuarial assumptions and a greater than projected return on planned assets. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $3.7 billion or $1.29 per share. Partially offsetting this favorable item were pre-tax charges of $865 million related to the transaction to acquire Vodafone\u2019s 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. These transaction costs include net incremental interest expense of $616 million related to the debt raised in connection with the acquisition and the bridge financing and other cost of $249 million. On an after-tax basis, these transaction charges totaled $540 million or $0.19 per share. Excluding these non-operational effects, adjusted earnings per share was $0.66 in the quarter compared with $0.38 a year ago, which included a $0.07 per share charge for the direct impact from Superstorm Sandy. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $2.84 compared with $2.24 last year, an increase of 26.8%. If you exclude the Sandy impact from last year the increase was 22.9%. The quarterly growth rate disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Also the results and growth rates exclude the effects of the non-operational items. With that I will now turn the call over to Fran. \nFrancis Shammo: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and Happy New Year. Before we get into the details I like to start with an overview with our results in a proper context. 2013 was a great year for Verizon from both a strategic and financial perspective. Of course the big strategic milestone was in our agreement to purchase Vodafone\u2019s 45% stake in Verizon Wireless which will give us sole ownership of the best asset in the global wireless industry. We have all the necessary financing in place, the special shareholder meetings for both companies are scheduled for one week from today on January 28th and a closing is planned for February 21st. As we have stated the transaction will be accretive to earnings per share by about 10% on day one. Full ownership will also provide access to all the cash flows and give us greater flexibility to develop converged solutions without any integration and due diligence risks. Our strategy is to build upon the foundation and strength of our network assets as a platforms for the future growth and innovation. To the end we\u2019re extremely well-positioned in the center of the trends that are driving growth in our industry. Mobility, broadband, video, cloud services and security. Sole ownership of Verizon Wireless along with our portfolio of other assets will enable us to better leverage our capabilities across the entire business. In wireless we completed our LTE coverage build and continue to invest in our 4G network to take advantage of the significant opportunities enabled by this technology as we innovate around our customer solutions. In 2013, we further strengthened our portfolio of enterprise strategic services with the development of a new cloud services product suite. The launch of a mobile healthcare platform and several targeted acquisitions which will enhance our capabilities in mobile video delivery. Collectively these moves further strengthen the business and improved our competitive position in key areas of growth. Underlining these strategic imperatives has been consistently strong operational and financial performance driven by solid execution and a disciplined focus on meeting our financial objectives. In 2013 we achieved or exceeded all of our key financial targets delivering on what we said in January of 2013. In wireless we had an excellent year, we added 4.1 million new postpaid connections generated service revenue growth of more than 8% and drove a 15% increase in EBITDA. Our growth in EBITDA was significant, $4.5 billion in absolute terms and we expanded our annual service EBITDA margin nearly 300 basis points to 49.5% squarely within our 49% to 50% guidance for the full year. In FiOS we increased our penetration of data and video services by adding more than 600,000 new customers during the year. The scale of our FiOS business and the popularity of our FiOS Quantum speeds drove annual consumer revenue growth for 4.9% up sharply from 3.2% in 2012. In the enterprise space inspite of continued economic challenges strategic services revenue grew 4.6% in 2013. In terms of wireline profitability we got it to a flat EBITDA margin and that is what we produced at 22.2%. In the area of capital spending we met our revised guidance of $16.6 billion which was up 2.7% over 2012. Even with that increased spending level we improved our overall CapEx to revenue ratio as we said we would. 2013 was a great year of significant earnings and free cash flow growth. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.84 up over 26% for the year. Our free cash flow growth was also very significant increasing by $6.9 billion to 22.2 billion, an increase of 45% from 2012. In terms of shareholder value, we generated a total return of 18.6% in 2013 for a combination of stock price appreciation and dividends. For the seventh consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase indicating their confidence in our future cash flows and earnings growth. From my perspective, 2013 was a great year of execution resulting in impressive customer growth and significant improvements in profitability and cash flows. Now, let\u2019s look at our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail starting with consolidated results on Slide 6. Total operating revenue grew 3.4% in the fourth quarter continuing our consistent top line growth trend. For the year, we added $4.7 billion to consolidated revenue, an increase of 4.1%. On a full year basis, the increase in consolidated revenues along with effective cost management resulted in more than 21% growth in adjusted operating income. On the same adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased $4.6 billion, up 12.3% for the year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 34.9%, the highest consolidated margin in eight years. As we highlighted earlier, adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of $0.66 was significantly higher than a year ago. Our earnings performance has been very strong and very consistent with double-digit year-over-year growth throughout 2013. Now, let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. We will continue to build on our network advantage in 4G LTE by deploying capital to increase capacity and density to our network. Our fourth quarter and full year Wireless results were excellent. We continued the strong momentum built during the quarter and fitted very strong. Total Wireless revenues grew by $5.2 billion in 2013 and totaled $81 billion representing two-thirds of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue. We sustained our strong service revenue performance with 8% growth in the fourth quarter making this our fifth consecutive quarter of at least 8% growth. For the year, service revenue grew 8.3%. We generated $8.3 billion of EBITDA in the fourth quarter, up 22.6% from the same quarter last year. Our service EBITDA margin in the quarter was 47% compared with 41.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, EBITDA grew to $34.2 billion, up $4.5 billion or 15%. This is a very impressive accomplishment and a testament to the efficiency of our network and our continuous focus on improving productivity and efficiency throughout the business by applying our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. Our 2013 EBITDA service margin of 49.5% improved by 290 basis points, a very significant expansion and is clearly within the guidance we provided during the year. The other point I would emphasize is the consistency of our Wireless profitability. We have posted margins of 49% or higher in the five of the last seven quarters. Now, let\u2019s turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 8. Service revenue growth continued to be driven by more customers and devices, increased data usage and smartphone penetration. Our Share Everything Plans are doing exactly what we expected driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage resulting in increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account. During the fourth quarter, retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 7.1% to more than $157 per month. We have seen consistent growth in this metric. For the full year, ARPA was up nearly $10 or 6.9%. We ended the year with 35.1 million postpaid accounts and average connections per account grew from 2.64 to 2.76, an annual increase of 4.5%. As we said, customer adoption of our Share Everything Plans has been exceptional. In just 18 months, more than 46% of our postpaid accounts are on these plans. In 2013 we effectively doubled the number of accounts on Share Everything from 8.1 million to 16.2 million. The value proposition is simple and straightforward and customers recognize the value of share data across multiple devices. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide 9. We had a strong quarter of quality customer growth. Retail net additions totaled 1.7 million, postpaid net adds were 1.6 million and prepaid were 80,000. In terms of the makeup of our postpaid net adds we added 1.4 million new 4G smartphone customers. Total phone net adds were 824,000 when you include the net change in 3G smartphone and basic phone customers. We had a very strong quarter of internet device growth with 675,000 net adds, 625,000 of which were tablets. The remaining net adds of about 74,000 were primarily Home Phone Connect. As usual we finished the year with strong customer growth and have great momentum heading into 2014. To recap the full year we had a total of 4.1 million new postpaid net adds and 4.2 million new 4G LTE smartphone customers. We added 1.8 million new internet devices with tablets representing about 1.5 million of this total. We also added about 360,000 other devices primarily Home Phone Connect. The offset to these additions was the net change in basic phones. Total phone net adds were 1.9 million for the year representing about 47% of the total. We ended the year with 102.8 million total retail connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection space reached 96.8 million and prepaid totaled 6 million. Postpaid growth adds increased sequentially to 4.3 million and total of 15.1 million for the full year up 1.7% roughly 60% of our growth adds for the quarter and the full year were smartphones. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 7.4% in the fourth quarter and our quarterly average was 7% for the year. As you would expect a significant percentage of our upgrades are smartphones which benefits us from a service revenue perspective. About 23% of upgrades in the quarter were basic phone customers getting a smartphone for the first time. The majority of the remaining upgrades were 3G smartphone customers moving up to a 4G smartphone which we were able to monetize through higher data usage and lower cost to serve. Our churn metrics continued to be market leading. Our retail postpaid churn was 0.96%in the fourth quarter down one basis point sequentially and up one basis point year-over-year. Next let\u2019s turn to slide 10 and take a look at device sale and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations, which include both gross adds and upgrades, totaled 11.52 million in the quarter. This is higher than any prior quarter in 2013. For the full year total postpaid activations totaled 41.5 million. Smartphone activations totaled 8.8 million in the quarter, an 87% were 4G LTE. For the year smartphone activations increased 7.8% to 31.1 million. Smartphone penetration increased to 70% of total phones. About 58% of our smartphones are 4G. We still have approximately 25.5 million basic phones and 24.7 million 3G smartphones in our customer base which gives us plenty of opportunity in 2014. We had our best quarter of tablet activations since they were first introduced in late 2010. We activated about 790,000 postpaid tablets in the quarter and 1.9 million for the full year. Our tablet base now stands at 3.6 million, so again we have a great opportunity in 2014 to expand this category and generate growth. 4G device penetration within our postpaid base really picked up in 2013. At year-end 44% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G up from 23% one year ago. Usage on our network continues to rise; currently about 69% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. Going forward we will continue to add capacity and optimize our 4G LTE network ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices. Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting on Slide 11. Our Wireline investments in platforms such as FiOS, global IP, security, cloud services and machine-to-machine enabled us to deliver the services, applications and solutions that our customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient and will improve our overall cost structure. In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive revenue trends. For the last six quarters, consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the fourth quarter, these revenues were up 6.4%, driven by FiOS price increases and incremental revenue from FiOS Quantum. We believe that consumer revenue growth in excess of 4% in 2014 is sustainable. FiOS now represents about 73% of consumer revenue and we sustained strong double-digit growth throughout the year. FiOS consumer revenue grew 14.9% in the fourth quarter and 14.3% for the full year. Within our base, 46% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to Quantum with speeds ranging from 50 to 500 megabits per second. In the fourth quarter, 55% of our FiOS Internet sales were at speeds in excess of 50 megabits per second. Our overall consumer monthly ARPU increased to $117, up 10.8%. Roughly two-thirds of our FiOS customers are triple-play, which have a much higher amount of recurring revenue per month. In terms of adding new customers, we are focused on profitable growth and have been disciplined in our approach in this very competitive market. In broadband, we had 126,000 new FiOS Internet additions in the fourth quarter and now have 6.1 million subscribers, representing 39.5% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 20,000. In FiOS Video, we added 92,000 new subscribers in the quarter. Total FiOS Video\u2019s customers reached 5.3 million, representing 35% penetration. We also continue to make steady progress with Copper migrations. During the fourth quarter, we converted about 80,000 customers. For the full year, we converted 330,000 customers exceeding our target of 300,000. This network initiative is important for us as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technologies. At the end of the year, less than 1 million consumer customers remained on Copper services within our FiOS footprint. Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which would result in additional recurring revenue. Looking at access lines, retail residential connections declined by 5.2% compared with a loss of 6.2% at this time last year. Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $200 million or 5.2%. Legacy CPE sales were down 25%. Excluding the quarterly decline in CPE, Global Enterprise revenue was down 2.6%. We also continued to see pressure in revenue from the public sector, which declined at a double-digit rate. This decline included both soft demand and product rationalization at the federal, state and local levels. Strategic services, which now comprised 59% of enterprise revenue, grew 2.3%. Key areas of investment such as datacenters, cloud and security services are growing at higher rates. We continue to work through economic challenges in the enterprise space in addition to public sector pressures. In the private sector, many enterprise customers are more focused on improving their cost structure, which puts pressure on our top line revenue. In general, enterprise customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions. Moving next to global wholesale, quarterly revenues declined $138 million or 7.8%. The revenue pressure is caused by the continued decline in legacy transport services. As we have stated, our wholesale strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to next generation Ethernet services. In terms of profitability, while growth in enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in the rest of global enterprise and wholesale continue to put pressure on Wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling efforts which we believe will ultimately improve our operating efficiency. Let\u2019s turn now to slide 13, to summarize our overall wireline results. Total operating revenues were down 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 1.4% for the full year. FiOS and certain strategic services continued their positive growth trends. While global enterprise and wholesale were pressured by declines in legacy transport services, DTE and challenges in the public sector. In terms of wireline profitability fourth quarter EBITDA was $2.2 billion resulting in an EBITDA margin of 22.4%. For the full year EBITDA increased 2.5% to $8.7 billion with an EBITDA margin of 22.2%. As expected our margin is similar to 2012. As I\u2019ve stated in the past we\u2019re confident that we will increase our wireline EBITDA margin in 2014. Let\u2019s turn to slide 14 for our discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation in the quarter remained very strong. For the full year cash flows from operations increased to $38.8 billion an increase of more than 23%. Free cash flow increased to $22.2 billion up 45%. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.8 billion and were $16.6 billion for the full year, an increase of 2.7%. We continue to be very focused on improving an investment returns and capital efficiency and our annual CapEx to revenue ratio improved from 14% in 2012 to 13.8% in 2013. At the segment level wireless capital spending was $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $9.4 billion for the full year up 6.4%. In wireline capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the year down 1.8% from 2012. The strength of our financial position enabled us to raise a record setting amount of capital in the debt markets last September. We ended the year with total debt of $93.6 billion with all the permanent financing in place related to the pending Vodafone transaction. We have a positive track record in terms of deleveraging the balance sheet. Our pre-transaction leverage ratios were very low and we utilize cash for an entire 8.1 billion in bonds during 2013. Even though we have more debt our balance sheet remained strong and we retained the financial flexibility needed to grow the business. In 2014 our priorities for uses of cash are unchanged. We will continue to invest in our networks, purchase spectrum and delever the balance sheet in a prudent and disciplined manner. We do not need to execute any major acquisitions to drive our business model. We understand the importance of our dividend and our Board of Directors have shown us support by improving dividend increases in each of the last seven years. In terms of capital spending we estimate total spending in 2014 to be in the range of $16.5 billion to $17 billion with continued improvement in our annual CapEx to revenue ratio. We will be opportunistic in terms of acquiring new spectrum and has consistently demonstrated our ability to execute on this through a number of secondary market transactions. Our willingness to sell or swap lower band spectrum with competitors shows our industry leadership and strong belief that spectrum to be in the hands of companies that plan to deploy this spectrum and put it to use. As far as pension funding requirements our minimum required for 2014 is $1.2 billion based on our current plan assumptions. As far as additional forward-looking information for 2014 we intend to provide that on our first quarter earnings conference call in April. Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. We enter 2014 with confidence and our ability to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our key strategic markets. We will continue to invest in our networks as the platforms for future growth and innovation. We have strong momentum in wireless and we expect to build on that strength driving further penetration of devices and extending our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and continue to differentiate ourselves with our FiOS Quantum product and quality of our video services. In the enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms like cloud, security, machine-to-machine and video delivery demonstrating to customers that we have a unique set of capabilities to provide customer solutions in a rapidly changing mobile first environment. In terms of our cost structure, we will continue to drive productivity improvements and operating efficiencies throughout the entire business utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about execution. 2013 was a great year. Our focus on the customer and improving the value proposition drove consistent top line performance and resulted in significant growth in profitability and cash flows improving our investment returns. For 2014, Lowell and I have challenged our business leaders to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we have achieved, improve the returns on our investments and create more shareholder value. We look forward to another great year in 2014. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions. \nMichael Stefanski: Fran thank you. Evan, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Okay, thanks. Good morning guys. \nFrancis Shammo: Hey John. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Hi. Wireless margins were better than we thought. It looks like partially due to the lower upgrade rate. Is Edge putting pressure on the number of upgrades and do you expect that the number to be lower in \u201814 than it was in \u201813? And then secondly, T-Mobile\u2019s new strategy with ETFs has been getting a lot of attention, how do you see that? Is that sort of an incremental change or do you think more of a fundamental change to the industry and how do you expect that to affect your business as you look out to \u201814? Thanks. \nFrancis Shammo: Hi, thanks John. Good morning. On the upgrades side, obviously the volume of upgrades this year were less than last year given all of the policy changes that we made and also keep in mind that at the end of 2012, we also had a free iPhone for the first time on our network, so that drove a lot of upgrade activity year-over-year so we had less volume this year. As far as the Edge program, the Edge program is going very well for us, but I would tell you just to give you a sense, it\u2019s generating less than 1% of our profitability right now. So this is not a significant portion of our portfolio, but obviously given the competitive environment here. First off, let me just reiterate the fact that I know there has been a lot of questions around a price war and if you really look at what\u2019s going on really what\u2019s the shift of pricing is between service and equipment and really when you do the math, there really isn\u2019t much of a price decrease here. It\u2019s just a shift of how that\u2019s marketed into the consumer market. So obviously, Edge is important to us from a competitive standpoint, but I am not going to give guidance John on where our upgrade rate will be in \u201814. As I said, I will give more guidance here once we close the Vodafone transaction. We have a shareholder vote here in a week. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 it would put us in a \u2013 at a very peculiar situation to give a further guidance at this point in time. So I will give more guidance on that at the end of the first quarter. So that\u2019s where we stand. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Great, thanks. \nMichael Stefanski: Evan, let\u2019s take the next question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. \nPhil Cusick - JPMorgan: Hey guys. Thanks. I guess two. One, can you help us think about Wireline margins next year, how do you think about the issues of total revenue being sort of flat to down and mix issues versus cost cutting just trying to sort of scale the potential for Wireline margin growth? And then second on the OnCue platform, can you give us some more color do you envision a full MSO over Wireless are out of region eventually versus more of a in region and sort of ancillary product? Thank you. \nFrancis Shammo: Hi, thanks Phil. Good morning. So Wireline margin, look I think that I had been pretty clear on this. Coming into this year, I said we would be flat given a lot of headwinds that we have from some of these startup products we have, especially around the Redbox joint venture, VDMS and some other things in there. So look, we are very optimistic that we can improve this margin in 2014. As far as top line, what I gave here today is we are very confident that we can sustain the 4% plus top line growth on the Wireline consumer piece of this. And as you noticed, we did our price ups here in the fourth quarter of this year which is different than what we have done in the past and that was to prepare us for obviously the January 1st which is when content cost go up in all of our contractual arrangements. So we have put ourselves in a position this year to offset that content increase which we weren\u2019t in a position last year. So we have done some strategic things from a top line perspective. Obviously enterprise continues to be a press point and I would say that we don\u2019t plan for that to change in \u201914 and I\u2019ve said that coming into \u201913 and leaving \u201913 that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see much of a change in our enterprise that top-line position in \u201914. So I think that the cost cutting measures of Verizon Lean Six Sigma some of the improvement in some of these other ancillary platforms where obviously we acquired Hughes Telematics that is now growing topline revenue coming into the fourth quarter of this year. You probably saw today we just signed another agreement with Hyundai to acquire their business. This is a growing platform but it does put pressure on us because we\u2019re hiring people and it was a loss when we acquired it and continued to be a loss through \u201913 and I think that could change some in \u201914. So there is a number of things here and I guess what I would say is I\u2019m confident that we can improve the margin of our wireline business going into \u201914. As far as the OnCue acquisition, look the focus here is really to accelerate the availability of the next generation IP Video service which will integrate into the FiOS video service and really what we\u2019re trying to do is differentiate this even more so with fiber to the home versus others with the TV offerings and reducing the point in cost and this really accelerates us from if we were try to build IPTV versus buying the IPTV technology. From a FiOS customer perspective we expect the benefits that they will have more elegant search and discovery interactivity and cost screen, ease of use but also keep in mind with the acquisition of Verizon Wireless and becoming 100% ownership of that we also plan to take that platform and integrate it more deeply with our Verizon Wireless 4G LTE network. So that really was the strategy behind this. As far as we enable this platform to take us over the top obviously we have our video digital media services that we have been working on for 2.5 years, we have just made two acquisitions related to that platform. So look I mean we\u2019re positioning ourselves strategically to be in a position to competitively compete around the whole mobile first world and video. So I think that\u2019s where we are. \nMichael Stefanski: Okay Evan let\u2019s take the next question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question. \nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: First Fran if you can just give an update on the net debt for Verizon Wireless and then secondly can you talk about the total amount of cost cutting that the Verizon Wireless business achieved during 2013 that contributed to the margin expansion you have had in the past few different initiatives that you were working on. And I was wondering if you can also share your aspirations in terms of the cost cutting potential for 2014. Thanks. \nFrancis Shammo: So I guess this will be the last and final quarter that I ever have to do this, hopefully. Gross debt of $5.3 billion, cash of $3.6 billion and net debt of $1.7 billion. As far as the cost cutting side goes look I mean coming into \u201913 we said that Verizon Wireless had already cut about $5 billion worth of cost out of their infrastructure. We said that we were targeting them for another $2 billion in 2013, they actually exceeded that benchmark in 2013 and again I\u2019m going to hold on 2014 here and I will give you more guidance when we get to the end of the first quarter and again it is all around our shareholder vote and the acquisition of the Vodafone transaction. \nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: If I can just follow-up with a different question then. On the pension side you mentioned the cash investment that you\u2019re planning to make for \u201914 where are you starting off the year in terms of the funding status and then where would that 1.2 billion roughly get you to? \nFrancis Shammo: Yeah so with the change in the discount rate and our assumptions around the return on assets are actual unfunded liability from the end of last year to the end of this year has improved by $2.6 billion. So our unfunded liability at the end of the year is for pension is at $5.9 billion. Now that also is very helpful from us well in the annuitization [ph] that we also did there in the \u2013 during the year of \u201813. So it puts us in a very good position with the $1.2 billion minimum contribution that we have into the plan to really start to make this a 100% funded plan. On the OPEB side of the house, our unfunded liability went from $24 billion at the end of 2012 to $19 billion, so a $4.2 billion improvement on that unfunded liability. So when you look at our balance sheet, even with the $8.1 billion of bonds that I paid off, we also had a decrease of over $6 billion in our unfunded liability. So the strength of our balance sheet has really taken off this year with almost $14 billion of a decline in our liabilities. \nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: Thank you. \nMichael Stefanski: Evan, let\u2019s take the next question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. \nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: Thanks for taking the question. Since we have seen some changes in competitive behavior, I feel like we have been getting sort of gathered data points around who is taking share from who, in the past, you guys have always had pretty positive reporting ratios versus all your peers, I know you don\u2019t give that on a regular basis. I am just curious can you either qualitatively or even quantitatively talk about how you feel about your net share gains versus your peers in light of the current environment? \nFrancis Shammo: Yes, thanks Brett. Well, I think the fourth quarter will stand on its own at 1.7 million ads and 824,000 net phone ads with the best quarter we have had since we launched tablets of 625,000. And I think that in a combination of itself will stand on its own. But let\u2019s just go back here a second from a competitive environment standpoint and I have said before we will compete and respond accordingly where we need to. And if you recall coming out of the third quarter this question came up and I said look we are seeing a segment of our base that is responding to some of the competitive offers and we will make the necessary changes that we need to, to compete against those changes. And if you look at our churn in the fourth quarter which was unusual because of a seasonal season, we normally would go up in churn from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. In this year, we sequentially declined by 1 basis point. So I think that tells you that we responded to our base, we listened to our customers and this is what we do. Now, the competitive environment has changed again here in the fourth quarter and you can expect us to respond accordingly. The other thing I would hedge ourselves on that we have built our brand. They are very long-term and we built loyalty with our customers and they come to us because of our network quality and superiority. We have, if you look at the coverage of our LTE network compared to our coverage, we are by far multiple times more coverage than our competitors and some as much as five and six times more coverage than our competitors. If you look at our Share Everything Plans, we continue to change them. We launched a new price plan. You probably picked up yesterday to go after our basic phone customers. And look I mean, we are going to compete in all devices in all markets. I think that another competitive advantage we have is our customer service and the quality of that customer service. If you look at the new store we launched which we call our destination store in Minneapolis, I mean we are going after smartphone customers, but it goes well beyond that from a competitive standpoint. I mean, if you look at that store, we now are going after the sports and fitness with all kinds of devices, music, gamers. We have a whole home section. And of course, we have been talking about the machine-to-machine and tablets for a while now. So again, I think there is more competitiveness than just one little price plan and we will respond accordingly and aggressively and continue to do what we are doing. \nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: Great, thanks for that color. \nMichael Stefanski: Evan, we can take the next question now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. \nDavid Barden - Bank of America: Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first one Fran on FiOS and the quarter was a little soft relative to the trend, but what I noticed was that the footprint path is inching up towards about 19 million, the homes marketed to looks like it\u2019s more in the mid 15 million. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the plans for mining out the rest of the FiOS opportunity and how that might contribute to the expectations for healthy consumer growth? I guess that\u2019s number one. And number two, if I can just follow-up on something you have talked about on the Verizon Vodafone transaction, I think Fran you have some estimates about what you thought the flow back was going to be and how it\u2019s going to impact trading in your stock and obviously, I am sure there has been a lot of hedging and things that have moved around. If you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on what you think the movement around the stock is going to be around the transaction based on your latest data will be super helpful. Thanks. \nFrancis Shammo: So on FiOS yeah so let\u2019s put it in perspective I mean we came out of the third quarter with an extremely good quarter of growth and the environment became extremely competitive and that the competition went after price and dropped pricing accordingly and we were pretty cautious on how we responded to that. We didn\u2019t believe that we wanted to chase some of those price points in the fourth quarter because we know from our customer experience that a lot of customers do not want us intruding in their houses during the holiday season. So we were cautious on how we responded to that and obviously that led to some slower growth that we had from a net add perspective but here is what I would say is if you look at what we have done in 2013 and the concentration of the Copper to fiber migration which we believe is a more profitable customer at the end of the day. They are just voice and DSL customers. So if you look at our internet volumes we actually did over 42,000 more net adds in \u201913 with internet on FiOS than we did in 2012. So that really was the concentration and we exceeded that by 30,000. So we came into the year thinking we would get 300,000 and we did 330,000 and what we\u2019re seeing from this space is once we move them with the same price plans either by voice or DSL they are then buying up as their only voice. They are coming over to our FiOS Quantum offer and if they come over they are buying up FiOS Quantum pretty significantly which is generating ARPUs in the range of $15 to $20 over and above what they were as a Copper customer. And as you know we gave a disclosure of 55% of these folks are coming in at 50 megabits and above and we will continue to increase our speeds. We\u2019re working on a new router that\u2019s going to give better in-home performance with all the extra wireless devices that are going on. So when you think about profitability and topline growth FiOS Quantum is extremely important because when you look at broadband versus TV if you look you don\u2019t have the contents of broadband is actually more profitable than the TV product. Now having said that as I said in the third quarter there is a lag, once we move these people in marketing to them and getting to move to the TV. So TV did lag this quarter and I expected it to lag this quarter and I expected to lag as we continue to migrate this extra less than 1 million homes that we have, less than our FiOS footprint. But also want to be clear that we\u2019re not going to build beyond what our current LFAs are and as you said we have 18.5 million homes pass now with about 15.3 open for sale on internet and about 15 for TV. So we have plenty of opportunity here but I would also tell you that again with even with the slower growth in the fourth quarter we still took market share and continue to increase our penetration and New York continues to be our fastest growing market with the most penetration this year over any other market we had in the TV arena. So I think that\u2019s what sets us up for \u201914. We will continue to execute on the same things that we have done this year which is concentration on migration and getting those quality customers to buy up in their bundles. On the second question of flow back, look I think it's getting harder and harder for me to zero in on what the flow back is given what the market has done and the short positions and everybody positioning where they are. As we said when we came into this transaction we thought the net flow back would be around 300 million shares but keep in mind we will have somewhere between 4.1 billion and 4.2 billion shares outstanding. So it's a pretty insignificant minimal amount based on the volume of daily trading that we think we will have. So that\u2019s really all the thought I can give you on the flow back at this point in time. \nMichael Stefanski: Evan next question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. \nMike McCormack - Jefferies: Maybe a couple of things, you commented regarding the Edge program. It seems like some of the competitors out there moving to EIP which you can argue is a pretty bad deal for consumer and a pretty good for carriers. You know why wouldn\u2019t you guys just get more active in the Edge marketplace and also that subsidy back for the consumer and then secondly on the enterprise side it seems like the industry overall is pretty weak. Can you just comment like the different pushback pieces [ph] there between legacy and new migration? What is the pricing environment look like from a competitive standpoint? Are you seeing any change there? Thanks. \nFrancis Shammo: Look on the Edge program as I said earlier we will respond where we think we need to respond. I\u2019m not going to get into what others have done between Edge and subsidy. I mean we had a very successful fourth quarter and what we launched in the marketplace they were receptive to that. We ran a lot of promotions in the fourth quarter and it drove a lot of growth to our business and look, I mean again we will continue to do what we do best, which is we add customers and we are profitable. On the enterprise side of the house, look I mean this is becoming a more and more struggling event here given the uncertainty of the government. Then as you now look to what is more concerned now is the President has nominated Senator Baucus, which who was leading the tax rate format. He has now been nominated to Ambassador of China, which means now that could delay some reform. Now, others are picking it up, but this just gives more room for caution as to what is going to happen in \u201814, are we going to get tax reform, what about the expenders, they haven\u2019t talked about expenders at all. There is a large cliff that we hit here on December 31, which was we lost a lot of credits and obviously the accelerated depreciation deduction is gone. So there is a lot of things that are putting enterprise back on their heels and people are just looking for cost-cutting measures, which mean that means I take a top line decrease in order to maintain that business. From a public sector perspective, look I mean the federal government, our sector there is declining double-digits year-over-year and that is obviously putting a lot of pressure here. There are opportunities in that segment that we are exploring, but the way I would look at this is you have seen us make some moves here around EdgeCast and upLynk and video digital media services and you have seen us make some other moves in our cloud and what we have recently launched with our new cloud products in a beta test. So within security, cloud, datacenters and our advanced communications arena, we are growing revenue year-over-year, even more significantly even strategic services overall. So there are certain niches that are growing, but unfortunately have not enough to offset the other declines that we are seeing just form the public sector and some of these other pressures that we are getting from the large enterprise customers. So again, I think \u201814 will be pretty much flat with where \u201813 was. I don\u2019t expect it to get any worse, but it will be a tough slope for \u201814. \nMike McCormack - Jefferies: Fran, you have talked about in the past, I think the percentage of customers just because that many years probably but percentage of customers have already moved from legacy product into IP Ethernet, is there a metric you can put around that as far as the customer base goes? \nFrancis Shammo: Mike, to be honest, I don\u2019t know that off the top of my head, I am sorry. \nMike McCormack - Jefferies: Okay, thank you. \nMichael Stefanski: Evan, let\u2019s take the next question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from John Mark Warren of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. \nJohn Mark Warren - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. I was just wondering on FiOS Quantum, you have seen had a lot of success getting customers to upgrade from lower speeds like 10 megabits per second to 50, are you \u2013 is that typically a one-time boost or do you see customers continuing to come back for more speed? \nFrancis Shammo: Yes, John thanks for the question. We actually continue to see customers come back. And if you think about this, this is like when you are in your home if you have one or two wireless devices running off of that WiFi at 10 megabits and you start to put three or four devices on that, guess what, you are not getting 10 megabits to those wireless devices anymore, you are getting something significantly less than that. So the only way to compensate for that is to increase the speed into that router, so we see customers 50, 75, 100. I mean as I said, we are going to come out with a new proprietary router that\u2019s going to even increase the speeds even more that are available for those wireless devices as people start to saturate the inside at their homes with tablets and other machine-to-machine connections. So this is an ongoing upgrade that customers are doing. We do this very seamlessly within the Verizon\u2019s FiOS TV product or online, where we pop up things within your TV. You can just click the okay button if you want to upgrade right there and then it automatically does it. There is no phone call needed. So we make it very easy for customers to do that, but yes, we see customers coming back for the second time. \nMichael Stefanski: Okay. Evan, if we can take the next question that will be great. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question. \nKevin Smithen - Macquarie: Thanks. We started to see a bit of a resurgence in access line M&A activity in the industry. Are there opportunities for Verizon to divest Wireline assets in 2014 or 2015 in order to increase the Wireless mix and de-leverage the balance sheet and if Wireline is a third of revenue today, where would you like to see that in three years? \nFrancis Shammo: Well, thanks for the question Kevin. It\u2019s pretty little foresight there on divestitures, but look I think Lowell and I have always said, we will always look at opportunities for anything. And if we feel that we can get an adequate return on our \u2013 for our shareholders based on the investments we have and the properties we have, then we will execute on that. So look I guess, I would say we always have an open mind but at this point there is nothing on the table for us around that. The properties we have are performing extremely well and we will continue to execute on that. As far as the three year view I guess I will talk maybe a little bit more of that when we get to the end of the first quarter call but again I\u2019m not going to give anymore further guidance. But look I think we\u2019re very satisfied with the asset portfolio we have and with the acquisition of Verizon Wireless and only 100% of that asset you\u2019re going to see us do more things around converged solution. So the wireline assets in my view will actually become more valuable over the longer term here with our footprint. So at this point I would say we\u2019re open but nothing on the table at this point in time. \nKevin Smithen - Macquarie: And you mentioned the loss some of the tax credits for bonus appreciation et cetera. When you think about your capital budget for the year you know are you going to continue to spend (indiscernible) you spend last year for wireless given some of the spectrum and strong subscriber growth or are there risk to the CapEx number to fund some of the tax prior to cash taxes that are likely? \nFrancis Shammo: No because I think look we gave guidance on CapEx, it's 15.5 billion to 17 billion. As I said before obviously wireless won't take a higher percentage of that CapEx spend and on the other areas of the business will take a lower portion of that CapEx spend especially as the FiOS builds continues to slow here. But no there is no strategic change in the way we view our investments and I don\u2019t do investments based on tax law. I didn\u2019t accelerate CapEx spending when the accelerated depreciation went into effect. I don\u2019t anticipate on the slow capital spending because it's not there anymore. So I think we will just continue to drive and execute on what we have from a cash tax standpoint as I said before obviously our cash taxes will go up with the acquisition of the 45% of wireless. I guided for next year when we announce the acquisition that we would be somewhere in 35% to 36% ETR. So I think at this point that\u2019s where we will keep it and I will give you more color once we come out of the first quarter. \nMichael Stefanski: Evan let\u2019s take another question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Mastrogiovanni of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. \nJoe Mastrogiovanni - Credit Suisse: Fran you have potentially some spectrum opportunities in the secondary market and ten you\u2019ve a couple of spectrum options coming up. How should we think about the way you prioritize the low band spectrum versus maybe the mid and high band spectrum. \nFrancis Shammo: Well look I mean it's obviously I think we have shown that we have made the secondary market a very viable market. We have done a number of swaps with Leap, T-Mobile. Sales with T-Mobile and AT&T and some swaps even with AT&T in that key sale that we did. As far as our portfolio obviously we like the 700 megahertz for the coverage of LTE that we did. AWS is our sweet spot at this point in time which is the spectrum that we have been swapping for. So we have a very efficient portfolio of spectrum and I think we have shown through the years that we are very efficient on how we use spectrum. Keep in mind that as I said we will participate in the auctions because we will need more spectrum but right now our current position is with the AWS we have and that we\u2019re launching in markets that you know in New York and San Francisco, Chicago. We\u2019re lighting that spectrum up. It's pretty much completed in New York. We will continue to add to that but keep in mind though too that we will also reappropriate our 3G spectrum to 4G. We will take that PCS spectrum that\u2019s been running in our 3G network as the (indiscernible) of the volume of that network continues to decrease as we move more 3G phones to 4G. We will reappropriate that spectrum over to the 4G LTE. So again you know 3 to 4 years we\u2019re in a very good space from a spectrum holding position but we will participate in the upcoming auctions. \nMichael Stefanski: Evan next question please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Please go ahead with your question. \nJonathan Chaplin - New Street Research: I wonder if I can just follow-up on that last question. So I think the next lot [ph] of spectrum is going to come on to be on to the market as AWS-3. So two questions around that, first of all do you see that as a valuable spectrum block that you really want to be a part of or is there enough opportunity within repurposing some of your 3G spectrum for 4G that that\u2019s not critical and then in terms of deploying that spectrum as it is valuable to you, does it require you to put more equipment on the tower or because it\u2019s contiguous to existing spectrum that you are deploying, can you do it with all existing equipment? Thanks. \nFrancis Shammo: Yes. So Jonathan on this one, look we will participate in the options that are coming up whether it\u2019s the AWS-3 or if it\u2019s the broadcast or whatever the FCC is going to auction here in the future. We have to build our portfolio for the next 10 years out. So as we have done in the past and we have shown that when auctions come up, it\u2019s opportunistic they only come up one time, so you need to participate. And that\u2019s what we showed when we won our 700 megahertz and we won the A and the B blocks a while ago and now we have repositioned that portfolio. We have launched the 700 megahertz in the AWS that we have. So AWS-3 is pleasing to us. Some of the higher frequencies is pleasing to us. So again, I won\u2019t get into \u2013 I am not an engineer, so I am not quite sure what happens to have it within the network in order to enable these spectrums, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s much based on what we have done with AWS. So we will participate in upcoming auction. \nJonathan Chaplin - New Street Research: Great, thank you very much. \nMichael Stefanski: Okay, Evan last question and then we\u2019ll wrap up. \nOperator: Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. \nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo: Great, thanks. Fran, I just wanted to see if you could give us a little quantify this what I\u2019d call the smart to smartphone device upgrade opportunity, you said you are seeing ARPA lift there, but between the 3G and 4G, I know there is more usage, but is there a way to quantify that kind of ARPA lift you are seeing with these smart to smart movers? \nFrancis Shammo: Yes. Look, I am probably not going to give you that, Jennifer. Look, if you look at a 3G usage moving to a 4G, we know that and we have seen it in our base that as soon as you get on the 4G with video consumption and the quality of video, your usage goes up. So obviously, it\u2019s hard for us to quantify this, because with our Share Everything Plan, you are obviously buying a bundle of minutes that you can share among all devices. But as you can see from our service revenue growth, our ARPA lift, our increasing connections, it\u2019s all coming together as to how these plans were designed. And as I said, we still have a lot of 3G customers and a lot of basic customers for \u201814 that give us a lot of opportunity. So I think I will leave it there and the numbers will speak for itself. \nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo: Thanks, Fran. \nMichael Stefanski: Thank you for your questions today. Before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Fran. \nFrancis Shammo: Okay, thanks Mike. Look, our industry has a very healthy competitive environment and we are forecasting continued strong demand for video and broadband across multiple networks. As I said, Verizon will compete aggressively in all of our markets. We will focus on delivering a superior customer experience, one of the best networks in the world. Our customer value proposition and the efficiency delivery of our services will generate growth and profitability. This focus on profitable growth will create value for our shareholders, provide the earnings and cash flow necessary to reinvest in our networks and platforms for future growth and innovation. We are very excited about the future. We will continue to invest, innovate around solutions deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our Verizon employees. So again, Happy New Year everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-10-17 11:03:06", "content": "Executives: Michael Stefanski - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Fran Shammo - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nAnalysts: John Hodulik - UBS Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research David Barden - Bank of America Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Tim Horan - Oppenheimer Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions). Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website later today. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement and our other legends on slides two and three. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. Before Fran takes your through the details of our results, I would like to cover a few special items that are included in our reported results. These are displayed on slide four. For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $0.78 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a net gain on the sale of 700 B block spectrum of $0.02 per share, offset by net incremental interest expense of $0.01 per share related to the debt we have raised to finance the acquisition of the remaining 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. We have accounted for the gain on the spectrum sale at the corporate level. So it is completely excluded from Wireless segment results. Excluding these non-operational effects, adjusted earnings per share was $0.77 in the third quarter compared with $0.64 a year ago. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share was $2.18 compared with $1.87 last year. Our discussion of operating results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of these two items and they are not part of our segment results. Finally the quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our key strategic networks and platforms, Wireless 4G LTE, FiOS and enterprise strategic services drove very strong operating performance and financial results. Our consolidated revenue growth rate increased once again and our focus on cost efficiency and improved profitability resulted in double-digit growth in both, operating income and earnings per share, which we have delivered in every quarter this year. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 was up 20.3%. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of $2.18, represents 16.6% growth. In Wireless, we had another very strong quarter of growth and profitability. We posted sequential quarterly improvement in terms of new retail connections and smartphones. Total retail net adds were 1.1 million, which included 927,000 high-quality postpaid net adds. Service revenue growth increased to 8.4%. EBITDA increased 10.7% and our EBITDA service margin was 51.1%. All of this was accomplished with 7.6 million smartphone activations this quarter, which was up sequentially and 12.5% higher than last year. Our Wireline results in the third quarter also showed improvement. Consumer revenue increased 4.3% driven by FiOS penetration. Enterprise Strategic Services revenue grew 5.2%. Total Wireline segment EBITDA increased 3.8% and EBITDA margin improved to 22.7%, up 50 basis points, sequentially, and 100 basis points year-over-year. Our strong operating performance and disciplined capital spending is driving growth in free cash flow. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow increased $3.1 billion to $16.6 billion, an increase of more than 23%. All-in-all, we had a great third quarter capped off by a lot of activity since Labor Day. We announced an agreement with Vodafone to acquire its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless. The transaction will be accretive to earnings per share, provide additional operating cash flows and enable greater flexibility to develop converged solutions without any integration and due diligence risks. The capital market environment was strong and we had a fully executed Bridge facility in place at the date of the announcement. We successfully arranged in one day, the required permanent bond financing with a $49 billion debt offering. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement for up to $12 billion in term loans. Last week, we filed a Form S-4 Registration statement and our proxy statement with the SEC, related to the pending transaction. Lastly, in a demonstration of their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, so we have been busy and productive on the transaction front, but as always our primary focus is driving strong operating results. Now let's look at our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with consolidated results on Slide 6. Total operating revenue grew 4.4%, continuing our solid top line growth trend. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 4%. The increase in consolidated revenues along with effective cost management, resulted in 16.8% growth in adjusted operating income in the quarter. On the same adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased to $11 billion, up 9.7%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points to 36.3%, which is the highest consolidated margins in more than five years. Now, let's move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. We will continue to build on our network advantage in 4G LTE by deploying capital to provide additional capacity and density to our network. We will also be opportunistic in terms of acquiring new spectrum. In short, we will continue to focus on executing our game plan. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate our ability to create strong operating momentum and deliver excellent results. We continue to perform extremely well in a highly competitive market. Total Wireless revenues grew to $20.4 billion in the quarter, representing 67% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. We sustained our strong service revenue performance with 8.4% growth our fourth consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 8%. EBITDA increased to $8.9 billion and our EBITDA service margin expanded by 110 basis points to 51.1%. Year-to-date, our EBITDA service margin is 50.4%. Our Wireless profitability has been very consistent with margins of 49% or higher in five of the last six quarters. Let's now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on slide eight. Service revenue growth continued to be driven by increasing connections, data usage and smartphone penetration gain. Our Share Everything plans are driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage, resulting in increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account. During the third quarter retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 7.1% to nearly $156 per month. We have 35 million postpaid accounts and average connections increased to 2.72 per account, up 4.6%. Customer adoption of our Share Everything plans have been exceptional. In just 15 months, 42% of our postpaid accounts are on these plans. The value proposition is simple and straightforward. Our customers quickly recognize the value of shared data across multiple devices, particularly in our 4G LTE environment. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide nine. In the third quarter, retail net additions increased by 1.1 million, up 2.2% sequentially. As I highlighted earlier, we had 927,000 postpaid net adds. In terms of the makeup of these postpaid net adds, we added more than 1 million smartphones which was a 5% sequential increase. Including the decline in basic phones, total phone net adds were 481,000. We added 370,000 new Internet devices including tablets. The remaining net adds of about 76,000 were primarily Home Phone Connect. We did encounter iPhone supply constraints that created a backlog at the end of September which resulted in some carryover to the fourth quarter. Within prepaid, we added 134,000 new retail connections which was 38% higher than the second quarter. We ended the quarter with 101.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base reached 95.2 million with the balance being prepaid. We maintained a high quality mix within our retail connections growth. Postpaid gross additions increased sequentially to 3.7 million. 73% of these gross adds were phones, including 2.2 million smartphones, both of which were higher than first or second quarter. The number of customer upgrades in the quarter remained fairly steady on a sequential basis, with a postpaid upgrade rate of 6.9%. The upgrade rate was also slightly affected by inventory constraints. As you would expect, a significant percentage of our upgrades are smartphones which continued to benefit us from a service revenue perspective. About 33% of customers upgrading to smartphones this quarter were purchasing one for the first time. A majority of the remaining upgrades were moving from a 3G to a 4G smartphone which we are able to monetize through higher data usage and lower cost to serve. And while upgrades are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter we continue to expect that our annual upgrade rate will be about the same as last year. Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Our retail postpaid churn was 0.97%. Next let's turn to slide 10 and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations, which includes both gross adds and upgrades, totaled 10.2 million in the quarter representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase. Similar to first and second quarter, 88% of the activations were phones. Smartphone activations totaled 7.6 million and 77% of these were 4G LTE. The smartphone mix was fairly balanced once again, with roughly 51% of the activations being iPhones. Our smartphone penetration continues to improve and we ended the quarter at over 67%. We also had another strong quarter of Internet device activations, which topped $1 million again in the quarter, 4G device penetration within our postpaid base continued at a rapid pace, 38% of our retail postpaid connections are now 4G, up from 33% in the second quarter and 17% one year ago. More than 50% of our smartphones and 70% of our Internet devices are 4G. Currently, about 64% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. Throughout the rest of this year, we will continue to add capacity and optimize our 4G LTE network, ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices. Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting on Slide 11. Our Wireline investments in platforms such as FiOS, global IP, security, cloud services and machine-to-machine enabled us to deliver the services, applications and solutions that our customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient and will improve our overall cost structure. In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive revenue trends highlighted by sustained FiOS growth. For the last five quarters, consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the third quarter, revenues were up 4.3%, driven of course by FiOS, which now represents about 72% of consumer revenue. Our overall consumer monthly ARPU increased to nearly $113, up 8.7%, roughly two-thirds of our FiOS customers are triple-play, which have a much higher amount of recurring revenue per month. We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In terms of broadband, we had 173,000 new FiOS Internet editions and now have 5.9 million subscribers, representing 39% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 56,000. In addition to the customer growth and increased penetration, we are also gaining traction with our FiOS Quantum offers for higher broadband speeds. More than half of our FiOS Internet sales in the quarter were at speeds in excess of 50 megabits per second, and just over 40% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to Quantum with speeds ranging from 50 megabits to 500 megabits per second. The incremental revenue from higher broadband speeds is contributing to overall consumer revenue growth. In FiOS video, we added 135,000 new subscribers in the quarter, up 13.4%. Total FiOS video customers reach 5.2 million, representing 35% penetration. We also continue to make steady progress with Copper migrations. During the quarter, we converted about 80,000 customers. Through nine months, we converted nearly 250,000 customers, so we are on track to exceed our target of 300,000 customers for the year. By year end, we estimate that less than 1 million consumer customers will be remaining on Copper services within our FiOS footprint. This network evolution initiative is important for us as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technology. Aside from the maintenance expense savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, convergence of fiber also provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional ARPU over time. Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail residential connections declined by 4.9%, compared with a loss of 6.3% at this time last year. Let's move to our enterprise market next on Slide 12. In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $113 million or 3%. Legacy CPE sales were down 21% and represented $91 million of the year-over-year decline. Excluding the quarterly decline in CPE, Global Enterprise revenue was down less than 1%. Keep in mind that our Global Enterprise revenue includes both, federal and state government. Strategic services, which now comprise 58% of Enterprise revenue, grew 5.2%. We continue to work through economic challenges in the enterprise space. In the public sector, we are seeing the effects of sequestering, budget cutbacks and contract renewals. In the private sector, many enterprise customers are more focused on improving their cost structure which puts pressure on our top-line revenue. Generally speaking, enterprise customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions. Moving next to global wholesale. Quarterly revenues declined $113 million or 6.3%. While this quarter is an improvement, the revenue pressure is driven by the continued decline in legacy transport services. As we have stated, our wholesale strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to next generation Ethernet services. In terms of profitability, while growth in enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in the rest of the global enterprise and wholesale continued to put pressure on Wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling efforts which we believe will ultimately improve our operating efficiency. Let's now turn to slide 13. To summarize our overall Wireline results, total operating revenues were down 1% in the quarter. FiOS and strategic services continued their positive growth trends, while global enterprise and wholesale were pressured by declines in legacy transport services and CPE. Excluding the decline in legacy CPE, our revenue performance this quarter was essentially flat year-over-year. In terms of Wireline profitability, third quarter EBITDA increased to $2.2 billion resulting in an EBITDA margin of 22.7%. On a year-to-date basis, the Wireline EBITDA margin was 22.1%. We continue to expect that our full year EBITDA margin will be similar to 2012, excluding the effects of Sandy from last year's results. We also continued to target improved profitability and margin expansion in 2014. Let's turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation in the quarter remained very strong. On a year-to-date basis, cash flows from operations increased to $28.4 billion, free cash flow increased to $16.6 billion, up 23%. This does not include the $1.9 billion of proceeds form the sale of the 700 B spectrum licenses, which is included in cash flows from investing activities. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.2 billion and were $11.8 billion year-to-date, up 4.3%. We estimate that full year 2013 capital spending will be approximately $16.6 billion. We are very focused on improving investment returns and capital efficiency and expect that our annual CapEx to revenue ratio will improve, even with the planned additional spending in 4G LTE. Wireless capital spending in the third quarter totaled $2.5 billion. Year-to-date, Wireless CapEx was $6.7 billion, 10.8% higher than last year. As noted on our last quarterly call, our 4G LTE coverage build is essentially completed. So our capital spending going forward will be focused on adding capacity and density to our existing coverage. We are utilizing our AWS spectrum to further optimize the network and we are already spending some of the incremental capital we allocated to Wireless capacity. In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.5 billion year-to-date, which was down 3.2% from last year. In terms of the balance sheet, total debt increased to $99.1 billion due to the permanent financing we have put in place related to the pending transaction to obtain full ownership of Verizon Wireless. However since we do have a cash until the close of the transaction, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained quite low at about 1.1 time. Let's summarize. Our third quarter results were very strong, showing consistent performance in all our key strategic growth areas. In Wireless, continued strong growth in service revenue coupled with high quality connections growth and the success of our Share Everything plans are driving double-digit growth and EBITDA and very strong cash generation. We continue to lead the industry in profitability and we are on track to deliver 49% to 50% EBITDA margins for the full year. We also expect to see customer growth increase sequentially in the fourth quarter. In Wireline, consumer revenue growth of more than 4% continued to be driven by FiOS, where we are on track to achieve our net subscriber growth targets. In Enterprise, we continue to focus on strategic services and have announced our new Verizon Cloud strategy. In terms of an update on our pending transaction to gain full ownership of Verizon Wireless, our permanent financing is secured and we have taken our bridge financing facility, and S-4 Registration statement and our proxy statement were filed on October 8, and are under review by the SEC. You can access these filings on our investor relations website or the SEC website. Efforts are underway to obtain required regulatory and shareholder approvals. We expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2014. Overall, a great third quarter, we are focused on continuing our momentum and finishing the year strong. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you, Fran. Brad, we are now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two quick ones. First, on the Wireless margins. Fran, how much of an impact did the Edge plan and the 24-month upgrade cycle have in the strong margin you guys posted in the third quarter? And then how should those issues affect the fourth quarter? And then I thought you talked about the uptick you had in the Wireless CapEx. You talked about the AWS deployment. Can you give us a little bit more detail on how that gets laid over and just sort of how quickly can you get some more capacity into the market on the LTE side?\nFran Shammo: Good. Thanks, John. On the VZW margins, so Edge, keep in mind we launched Edge at the very end of August. It really didn't really pick up speed until September. Our indirect channels did not get it until the very, very end of the quarter, so there really was no impact from the Edge program to these results. I mean, we will see more in the fourth quarter and we will wait to get to that to report it out, but very, very immaterial impact. On the 24-month cycle it's very hard for us to determine, because again people are proactive on when they upgrade to a cycle basis. Of course, you know it did delay some of the upgrades from going from that the 20-month to the 24-month and that went into effect on September 1, so again only really 30 days of impact there. We will probably see more of that in the fourth quarter. As far as the VZW margin impact from the two of them, I would say very, very limited in this quarter and you can see why the margin was the way it was just from an overall revenue increase and some of the cost containment measures that we have been putting in place for quite some time and we could talk more about that. As far as CapEx goes, so here is where we are at. Obviously, we know that we have completed the coverage build of our 4G LTE and an obviously if you look at our map, it's pretty significant coverage compared to our competitors. Now post June, all of our efforts have gone into the capacity and densification. And given where we are, if you look at some of the metrics, I mean, if you think about 38% of our customers are on the 4G network and they are generating 64% of the data usage, this is a pretty significant volume of usage going through that network and we know that given the growth of this we have had some densification issues in major cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco and we are totally focused on those types of issues, and what you see us doing is being very proactive in more in-building coverage, more densification cell sites, launching the AWS spectrum, so you are going to see that through in the fourth quarter and that's why we increased the CapEx spending, but I think the walk-away here is, is that we are extremely focused on our network. It is our brand, we will continue to perform in this area and also the return here if you think about every dollar I put into that network when you have 64% of the data on a tiered, shared everything plan, you can see that coming through from our revenue, so the return on the invested capital is pretty immediate and it's pretty significant, so we will continue to concentrate on that effort.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: Right. Thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay. Brad, we are ready for the next call.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead with your question.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Hi, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions, I guess focused on Wireline. First, the FiOS volumes very, very strong quarter in broadband. I think it adds up almost 30% year-over-year. Saying that, the extent to which video is bundled to this, looks to have taken a bit of a hit in the quarter. I think there is a 40,000 disconnect between broadband adds and video adds in the FiOS side. That's much larger than normal. Can you help us think through that? Then second, just on Wireline margins. Good progress in the quarter on margins. The comment on margin expansion for 2014, maybe you can help us think through, are there anything that that necessarily relies on? For instance, if enterprise is still under pressure next year, does that put pressure on margins? Or can you grow margins despite that? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Jason. So on the FiOS broadband. We did have a very, very good quarter from a net add perspective, especially on a year-over-year basis and especially since when you look back in history third quarter is normally a very high churn quarter for us. Keep in mind a couple of things here. So on the broadband side of the house you have to remember that as we do 80,000 migrations from our Copper, who are voice and DSL only over to FiOS, you are getting voice and FiOS Quantum adds. And as I have talked before, we really don't approach these customers on a TV product for about five to six months and then it takes us about another three to four months of marketing to actually see some success in conversion and we see about a 30% conversion once we do that. They are really interested in the broadband speed and of course what you see in the Wireline segment today is, as we migrate these customers from the Copper product to the FiOS product, we are bringing them over at the same price. But what we see is almost immediately with the speeds that they are getting in the FiOS Quantum, they themselves are choosing to upgrade right into that 50 megabits and at times now even into the 75 megabit products. So their ARPU is going up which is generating some of this Wireline increase that you see. So TV net adds were up 13% year-over-year. Now granted, it means some of these adds we have got came from some of the disputes that happened in the competitive nature here during the quarter, but still even without that we would have seen an increase year-over-year in our productivity and our penetration of FiOS. So we are very happy with where we are, but TV will always lag when we do these migrations. On the Wireline margin, look I think I have been pretty consistent here with where we think Wireline is going, and I am still very confident that 2014 will show improvement. And just to keep everyone grounded here, the reason I say this is, I am looking at enterprise as being flat, with no substantial growth and we can talk about just the continued disruption that's coming out of Washington and the uncertainty and I think that will continue at least in the short-term here given what happened last night and extending some of this into the first quarter, what's going to happen, what's going to happen when we get to December 31 on the cliff jump off as we had last year with some of the tax preference items. So I still think there is a lot of swirl going on and there is just a lot of uncertainty and the enterprise is going to sit on the side line. But as I look at '14, I am looking as that's going to be flat. So what do we see? We see continued progress in our FiOS penetration. As I said, I am very comfortable with 4% plus growth in revenue here going forward. I continue to think that we will penetrate all of our markets and continue to gain share, both in broadband and TV. And also keep in mind, as I said before, with the Hughes Telematics acquisition, VDMS and Redbox, they have all been headwinds this year because we have gotten them up to started and we are eating some of the up start cost with them. That I believe starts to diminish in '14 which actually helps. And with Hughes, they start to generate more revenues. VDMS [starts] [ph] to generate revenues. So there is a lot of things happening but I also think we can't lose sight of our Verizon Lean Six Sigma efforts on our cost initiatives that we have in our Wireline business and you are starting to see some of these efforts start to come through on our efficiency side of the house. So we are very, very optimistic that we can continue to move the Wireline profitability forward.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs: Great, that's very helpful. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhilip Cusick - JPMorgan: Hi, guys, thanks. I think we all continue to be surprised with the Wireless service revenue growth. Can you talk about where customers are in terms of taking more data than the minimum? How many customers or how many families or per devices are taking more than sort of a standard 2-gig package per device, and where does 4G usage looks now? If not an actual number then versus where average usage was a year ago? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Phil. On the Wireless service growth. Obviously I am not going to get into exactly how many customers break bundles and all that, but I think there is some things that we have to understand here that's driving it, so first off if you look at this quarter, again we had a very strong quarter with 480,000 smartphone adds that are very high quality and these are all coming in mostly on our 4G and shared price plans, some of these are 3G phones obviously, but the majority is coming in on our 4G product. The other thing, I think, you have to understand too is that we are coming up on the anniversary dates of the 3G, when the iPhone was launched and those customers now are upgrading to 4G phones and moving into shared price plans. If you look at 3G usage and the customers moving into 4G, and they start to utilize this LTE network, they are starting to realize the benefits of that and their usage significantly goes up from where they were in 3G, so that's stimulating even if we come over and I have said before the way our sales force is approaching this is they recommend 2 gigs for every device that a customer brings into shared pricing, so even with that you think about that usage versus 3G device usage, that in itself is pretty significantly higher, so that drives the revenue. Then you look at the tablets and the Internet devices, you get into machine-to-machine connections or machine-to-machine it continues to escalate quarter-after-quarter and then of course then we look at the prepaid side of the house, so I think it's a combination of all of these things that are driving that. When you think about 42% of our basis on shared plans, we still have a long way to go of converting a lot of that 3G product over to the 4G and into the shared plans, so there is still a lot of runway here to continue to grow this revenue stream for us, so that's that and I think I answered the 4G versus the 3G usage.\nPhilip Cusick - JPMorgan: Then if I can just follow-up quickly on your government comment a few minutes ago it sounds like you are a little cautious on 4Q in terms of enterprise decision making and things like that. Is that a fair read?\nFran Shammo: I think the cautious is, Phil, I don't see anything changing here from 3Q to 4Q. Again, you heard me say that keep in mind our federal and state government are in our Enterprise segment and that really is declining faster than the rest of the segment right now. Now, the positive to this is, is that within our cloud services it's fairly flat, so where we see the federal government during the sequestering period pulling back in some areas, they are actually buying some of the data center and cloud products so there is a balance here, but I don't think things get a lot worse but I don't see them getting any better.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, let's take the next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Fran, I wonder if you could update us on the VoLTE rollout, when we are going to start to see that and when you start to see the benefit of lower smartphone cost and lower subsidies going forward? You touched briefly relating to the Vodafone, about the ability to bring converged solutions together, maybe you can expand on that little bit and talk a little bit more about what we might see from the cable joint venture over the next few quarters. Thanks.\nFran Shammo: On VoLTE rollout, we are still on track, you will probably see us have a VoLTE capable handset here in the fourth quarter. As we said that we will light up the VoLTE rollout starting in the first half of next year, so we are still very much on track on that one. As far as lower smartphone cost and subsidies, look, I think the ecosystem has a lot here. You are going to see a lot of new and innovative products come out in the fourth quarter, but subsidy is done on a handset-by-handset, manufacturer-by-manufacturer. Then obviously as you have heard me say before, the more manufacturers we can get into this ecosystem, and it really comes down to an operating system, the more competitive nature this marketplace will become, so I still believe that that will happen. Obviously, you have heard me talk about VoLTE will contribute to some, as we start to remove some of the CDMA chip, but then there is other technologies like multi class, multicast that will be put into the phone. So there is a lot of technologies being removed from the phone, but new technologies that are being implemented into the phone. So this is going to be a long path, but I do think, as I said before, subsidies will gradually come down over the next two to three years. On the converged solutions side, look I mean as far as the joint venture with the cable companies, we have talked about, we still have a distribution agreement with one another and we continue to work with one another to sell each other's products. But the marketing joint venture or co-development has been terminated and we are moving in our separate ways on that. And what you are going to see here is, as we talked about Verizon Wireless, the acquisition of Verizon Wireless, we now get to more of a converged middle with our consumer products between FiOS and Wireless and we no longer have the artificial wall up between the affiliate transactions or anything like that. So I won't talk about what you will see, but I think what you will see from us is a move forward of bringing to the customer the best product available between Wireline and Wireless.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two questions. First on Verizon Wireless. Can you give us an some update, Fran, on the net debt? Then secondly, on the Wireline side, I think you mentioned that you have less than 1 million Copper customers in your FiOS footprint, if I got that quote correct. Can you talk about the significance of that in terms of the opportunity to take those remaining Copper customers and get them over to the fiber and the potential cost savings that you could generate by moving to fiber and really getting the one network architecture within your FiOS footprint, for at least the residential customers? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Okay, thanks, Mike. So I guess this should be the last quarter I have to answer this question on net debt. So gross debt for Wireless is $10.2 billion, cash is $6.6 billion, net is $3.6 billion. On the Wireline side, yes you did get the quote right. So there will be less than 1 million customers that are on Copper within our FiOS footprint. And you see us from our migration strategy in the last two years, I think in the last two years now when we exceed our 300,000 for this year, we will have moved close to 600,000 customers from our Copper network into our FiOS network. We will continue to approach this migration. Now, if you think that we do 300,000 a year, you are looking at three more years to get that completed, but we will continue to try to accelerate as much as we can. And from a cost benefit, obviously what you are seeing is some of those benefits coming through the Wireline results today just from a repair metric, from a truck roll metric, the reliability of this network is drastically different than the reliability of the Copper network. So you are going to see us continue to invest in the FiOS infrastructure. One of the things that we are doing now is the network team has been working over the last year in provisioning the FiOS network into our enterprise and small business customers using the GPON technology. So we fully expect to utilize this FiOS backbone much more than it had been in the past. So you are going to continue to see this migration and you are going to see the cost benefits coming through our operating results.\nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: And Fran, I just have follow-up on one other thing. So if you think about your Wireline footprint in total, are there any updated views on what you do outside of this core FiOS footprint?\nFran Shammo: Well what you are going to see us do is, obviously now, we have done some of this in the past, but using Wireless, our Fusion technology, from a broadband perspective. So when we talk about converged solutions and bringing the best solution to our end user customer, this goes into what we do with our Copper customers outside of the FiOS footprint and what do we do for them from a voice perspective and also a DSL perspective. And obviously we have Home Phone Connect and we have Voice Link on the Wireline side that we have already started to sell to our Copper voice customers as a substitute to the Copper product. So we have already done some of this but you are going to see more technology come out here in 2014 that's going to address these issues.\nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two if I could. Fran, just on the Wireline side. The consumer business has been really on fire, the best performing part of that entire segment right now and it's really been in the last two quarters or so that you have added about a $500 million worth of run rate revenue in that business and I know FiOS actually was growing in terms of net adds faster last year on average than it's growing this year. Can you talk a little bit about what the real drivers of that consumer business are and can we extrapolate those into 2014? Just teasing a part of your commentary about enterprise, if you took out the CPE or kind of talking about global enterprise being flattish year-over-year, but obviously government is a wake on that. Is it then can we interpret that the basic Enterprise business coming from non-government sources is actually starting to grow year-over-year? If you could kind of elaborate on that, it would be helpful. Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, David. On the Wireline consumer business, I think when we size this all up we really have three main focuses. As I have talked to you before, we have become a very disciplined pricing strategy around our FiOS product and we looked at cable a number of years ago, we looked that they were very, very disciplined in how they did price ups to match their content cost and we were not really good with that, but we started this as you know last year, very early in the year and we have a strategy going forward so we will continue to drive that strategy of pricing up the product equivalent to our content cost increases. If you look at the next level of concentration we have had is, we are going after market share. Now as far as slowness in the net adds there is some seasonality here, there is always something that happens in the environment that causes us, but look I mean there are some markets that were over 50% penetrated, so those markets have a slower growth, but we are still gaining share in some of our later markets like New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, which are, in my mind, underpenetrated to where they should be, so you are going to see a little shift. There could be some slowness though as we start to penetrate some of these markets in 50%, but the fact of the matter here is that we still have a long runway. If you look at our 39% penetration we still have a long way to go from a net add perspective, but the other thing that's driving this growth and we can't lose focus of it is the migration of these FiOS, of these Copper customers over to FiOS, and as we convert them as I said, it may take us a little while but then we get that uptick in our TV product along with that. The other focus that we have too that is not in the top line, but really comes in through content you see us doing some very innovative things around negotiation of content moving away from a per subscriber-type content to more of a per viewer-type cost of content, so we are in lot of conversations with content providers that were willing to pay for people who watch their programs, but were not willing to pay on an overall subscriber base and we have been successful here with some of the smaller tier content carriers, but that's also benefiting the profitability of this product going forward, so I think there is a whole combination of why we think that we will continue this 4%-plus revenue increase with continued penetration and continued profitability on FiOS. On the enterprise side, when we say relatively flat if you take out CPE, our decline in enterprise will be 0.8% this quarter versus 0.9% last quarter, so the government is declining faster than that. I would sit here and tell you that enterprise is growing. We do have certain areas of our business that are growing. If you look at our security product, if you look at our cloud products, if you look at the Terremark product, they are in fact growing, Hughes is growing, but then you have the legacy voice and data that is not growing and that's declining, so net-net, I would say it's relatively flat without the government pressure.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from of Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: Thanks for taking the question. When you launched the Wireless deal, you had talked about an objective of getting back to your pre-deal leverage levels. I believe you said about four to five years, but correct me if that's wrong, but regardless of the timeframe I was hoping maybe you could just comeback and talk about some of the foundational assumptions that support that goal. For example, do you expect to see capital intensity continue to improve. I am curious what you are assuming about your ability to maintain or even grow your Wireless margins over that four to five year period? Then lastly, can you give us any color what you budgeted for spectrum purposes?\nFran Shammo: Yes, thanks, Brett. So look, I am not going to get in to the details of what we have projected. If you think about everything that we had considered here, we considered tax, we considered CapEx, we considered the incremental tax rate. As I said, our tax rate will increase to a 35% to 36% range from what we have always guided from a 31% to 33% range and that's because of the VZW coming over. We had to project out what our interest rate was. We know what that is now, based on the offering that we did. As far as CapEx goes, I have been pretty consistent here. You should consider us improving our CapEx to revenue ratio going forward. You should look at us as to what we have invested this year and we are going to do what we need to do to continue to invest in our networks, and our platforms. But moving out of this, there were three priorities that we set up to come to that four to five years. One was we will continue to invest in our networks and platforms. That is top priority for us. Next is, is we will continue to invest and buy licenses, either opportunistically or in the auctions. I can't tell you what that number is because obviously it's going to be a public auction and we have a lot of strategies around how we acquire licenses. But that was built into our model. And then finally, the dividend policy is also a very critical piece of this component to our equity shareholders and I think our board show that when they increased the dividend at the same time that they announced the deal. They are very confident in our cash flow. Then finally, we have a commitment that we will de-lever the balance sheet as quickly as possible. So look, I think if you look at the performance, if you look at our cash flow and our free cash flow this quarter, I think we are demonstrating that that four to five years is within our horizon and we will meet our targets.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: And are you assuming you can maintain margins at roughly the same levels.\nFran Shammo: I am not going to get into giving guidance around margins. I think our performance speaks for itself and the margins speak for themselves.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, Brad. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Hi, thank you very much and good morning, folks.\nFran Shammo: Good morning.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Fran, just a follow up on the prior question around VoLTE rollout. What does this mean in terms of network investment here? And specifically what I am trying to understand is are you where you need to be with respect to your network in order to provide ubiquitous VoLTE services nationwide? Or should we expect some additional investment in order to get to that level?\nFran Shammo: Yes, so, Amir, on this one, it's a good question. But look, the issue with VoLTE is coverage. And as I have always said, we will not rush the VoLTE launch until we are sure that when you connect up a VoLTE voice call, it will be very, very similar to a 3G CDMA call, because that's what our customers expect. They know what the CDMA footprint is. They know where they can call. It's an unbelievable network. We have to make sure that our VoLTE experience is the same and that's why we have taken such a long time and we believe that when we get to the first half of next year, the network will be ready, the experience will be very, very similar and that we will be ready to roll this out. But it is already built into the CapEx that we are spending. You should not see incremental CapEx for rolling VoLTE. It really is around coverage and of course it goes into the densification and capacities.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays: That's very helpful. And if I may, I just have a follow-up here, somewhat of a bigger picture question. As you mentioned this is sort of the fourth consecutive quarter in which you folks have posted 8% plus Wireless service revenue growth. How sustainable do you think this is going forward. And the way I am thinking about it is, what advantage does now controlling the full cash flow of Verizon Wireless provide you in driving initiatives to sustain this level of growth?\nFran Shammo: Well again, it goes back to the earlier answer that there is a lot of things going here and if you look at just sustaining this growth, I think I have been pretty open that says, look I can't sit here and tell you that 8% growth is going to happen forever in Wireless. I mean you are talking a huge base of revenue. So I do think that the growth rate will come down over time. But look, I mean there is so much technology being developed throughout the world that's running over LTE. If you look at our innovation center in Waltham and roll this out of our innovation center that we just opened up in San Francisco to welcome all the application developers into that center, so it really comes down to the application developers developing new technologies around LTE, so it's hard for me to determine what this continued growth rate will be but there is a lot of run way, there is a lot of technology and the growth rate is still there. Now, I will tell you that in the short-term, I do believe that we can continue on 8% growth, but over the long-term I would tell you that I think that's probably a high aspiration.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Great. Thanks for the incremental color.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie: I wondered if you could review where you are specifically in terms of the AWS rollout. I think it's been quoted from the key partner you are going to end the year at 5,000 AWS sites. Where are you at the end of Q3, and can you confirm the 5,000 number and what the target would be at the end of '14? Also maybe what kind of user speeds uplink and downlink you are seeing in the AWS markets versus the 700 markets particularly in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, you have cited higher congestion?\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Kevin. Yes. Look, I mean we are not going to get into a speed discussion, because speed has a lot to do with nobody is on the network, so obviously you are going to generate a lot higher speed, and what we are building the network for is a very consistent reliable experience and we have always said that the network engineers have designed the LTE network when it is fully loaded and that's the key here. When it's fully loaded, and obviously with 64% of data being driven through that network, it's pretty loaded, you are going to experience on average 10 megabits to 12 megabits. Now you will get burst of 20-30, and I know there was a report that came out about AWS of 80, but there's no one the network, so I think it would be irrelevant for me to speak to that, but here is the point. The point is, is that we are doing a lot around our network. We are launching the AWS. As I said, we are launching a lot of technologies and the issues what they were currently having in some of the larger cities with the densification these are started to be fixed in the third quarter and we are going to make a lot of progress in the fourth quarter, so I think that's really what's important here. To me, it's kind of irrelevant how many cells sites have what, it all comes down to the quality of the network, the reliability and the consistent performance of that network.\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie: You touched on the incentive option. How long do you think this AWS spectrum can carry you and if the incentive option gets pushed back for whatever reason, do you have enough capacity in AWS to last you through 2016-2015? What are the scenarios?\nFran Shammo: Well, it's not just AWS, because we can re-appropriate our CDMA spectrum in [this] we need over into our LTE network, so as I said before given the timeframe we are in now, we are good for at least three-plus, four years with the spectrum holdings we have, but obviously we are going to participate in the auction, we are going to need more spectrum for the future of our business and we are going to invest in that spectrum.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: Maybe just two Wireless clarifications and an update maybe on what your cloud strategy is at this point. I know you are launching new product, but on Wireless, can you maybe just discuss market share shifts? Sprint was shutting down the network and T-Mobile has been making some marketing initiatives. Have you seen any real changes out there in market share? Then Fran, I know you have talked about the ARPU growth, but are you seeing any resistance for the price increases. It seems that ARPU growth is really, really positive for the longer term trend as it [continues] it's doesn't kick-in. Just if you can talk about your new enterprise kind of cloud data that you launched that would be great. Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Tim. On the market share side, look, I mean we did 927,000 net adds this quarter which was a strong quarter. Obviously, we could have done more, but there was constrains in the iPhone, especially around the 5s, and I think that constrained us for this quarter, but that will roll into our fourth quarter here, so from a market share standpoint, we continue to gain market share. Now, I can't sit here and tell you that we don't lose customers to our competitors. If you look at some of the other things that we were dealing with, I mean we do have some low end, if you will, some single line basic phone customers and older 3G smartphone customers. And what we see the shift here is, we are seeing them shift out of postpaid into our retail prepaid products, but we are also seeing some of them shift off to some of the lower end price plans of our competitors. We did launch some things in September and we saw some improvement there and we will continue to get aggressive with those types of customers here in the fourth quarter. But from a market share perspective, we are gaining market share. I mean I think we will still post the best quarter of any competitor out there. As far as the ARPA trend, look, I mean this just goes what I have said before, as the focus going forward is not necessarily how many net adds I do, it's how we generate the growth of our topline that produces the margins. And this goes around everything I have talked about this morning with the quality of the network, 3G to 4G, all of these other devices and some of this ARPA growth, as we say, is revenue per count. I mean these could be, as I said before, these are other devices being attached to the network not necessarily smartphones or tablets. As you know we sold cameras. We have sold a lot of machine-to-machine technology that are in our stores now. So there is a lot of things that are contributing to this. Even if it's $0.50 to $0.60 a subscriber, it's still generating that revenue coming through that ARPA. Then on the cloud, obviously for some clarification here. Tim, I think what you are talking about is on October 3, we launched a paid public beta of our new public cloud infrastructure. We are calling this Verizon Cloud Compute and Verizon Cloud Storage for businesses and governments of all size and our technology will give us the ability for this cloud based infrastructure to handle enterprise level workload securely and a compliance with a lot of relevant requirements, which will provide flexibility and economic benefits of generic public cloud. So the launch of this cloud is just the next step in our cloud evolution. You are going to see a lot more of this come through in '14. We will unveil new features. We have this technology established in seven of our data centers on a worldwide basis. You are going to hear more of this but it is a trial and a beta this point. And I think you are going to see us do a lot more in '14 and you will start to see some of the benefits there.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo: Thanks, Fran. Two quick questions. First on SMB. Cable seems to be moving more upstream, at least that's from some of the (inaudible) we are hearing. I am just wondering if you are seeing that and how critical is Wireless as a part of your sales pitch to this segment, because that's obviously an advantage for you. Then quickly on pre pay. AT&T has made some more recent comments that they are going to be more aggressive on pricing there, probably more to your league. So just your quick thoughts on your prepaid strategy here? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Alright, thanks, Jennifer. So on small business, look, I always split this between two segments. We have a segment that's within FiOS and a segment that's without, outside of FiOS. Obviously Verizon Wireless does an unbelievable job with small business and Wireless products. But within our footprint, within FiOS and outside of FiOS, there is two things. One is, within FiOS we are actually gaining share in the small business environment. The issue is that obviously we have to pass those small businesses with FiOS and quite honestly that has not been not been a concentration of ours. Most of it was to residential homes within our footprint. So now it's building out all of those malls and so forth. So we have gone down the street. Now the issue is getting that in to the small stores of these small businesses. So within FiOS, we are doing a fairly good job. Outside of FiOS, it's hard for me to compete with the speeds that cable can offer them through the DOCSIS 3.0 type technology. So yes, we are using Verizon Wireless. We are using Fusion where we can. But it's hard to compete because Fusion can't supplement a hard wired broadband connection into a very populated area. So that segment, we are loosing share. Within FiOS we are gaining share. On the prepaid strategy, I have said all along, we have our prepaid on 3G and the theory here is to keep the 3G network as full as possible to contribute contribution margin since we are not investing in that any more and we will continue to get as aggressive as we can and you can see that over the last year and a half we have become more aggressive in the prepaid environment but we also use our resellers to drive the lower end of prepaid, because we don't want the brand of Verizon Wireless connected to that low end environment with the quality premium network of Verizon, so that's the differentiation I think between us and our competitors, but you can see we continue to make strides in prepaid and we will be as aggressive as possible on the 3G network to be competitive.\nMichael Stefanski: Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Okay. Thanks, Mike. Just a few comments here before we end the call. Our industry has a very healthy competitive environment and we are forecasting continued strong demand for our video and broadband across multiple networks. We are executing effectively within this competitive environment, consistently delivering strong results, positioning ourselves for future revenue growth, earnings and cash flow growth and we will continue to invest in all of our networks to deliver the most reliable customer experience and that's what they expect. We are excited about the future as we continue to invest, innovate and deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. Thank you for joining the Verizon call this morning and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-07-18 11:28:03", "content": "Executives: Michael Stefanski - SVP, Investor Relations Fran Shammo - EVP & CFO\nAnalysts: Phil Cusick - JPMorgan Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs John Hodulik - UBS Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research Mike McCormack - Nomura Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Tom Seitz - Jefferies Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Tim Horan - Oppenheimer\nOperator:\nMichael Stefanski: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, senior vice president, investor relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with our chief financial officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be available on our website later today. I would also like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. Before Fran takes you through the details, I would like to make you aware of a non-operational item included in the quarterly results. For the second quarter, we reported earnings of $0.78 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $147 million after tax, or $0.05, for the favorable effect of an interim actuarial remeasurement associated with one of our pension plans, due to settlement accounting. The noncash credits were due primarily to an increase in the discount rate assumption used to determine our current pension liability. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.73, compared with $0.64 a year ago. Our discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effect of the nonoperational gain. In addition, the quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone. Our strategic investments in 4G LTE, FiOS, global IP, and cloud services continue to drive strong operating performance. We are executing well in these key growth areas. Overall, consistent top line growth, along a strong focus on cost efficiency and profitably, resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share in the second quarter. In fact, we have posted double digit earnings growth in five of the last six quarters. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.73, up 14.1%. Year to date, adjusted earnings per share were $1.41, representing 14.6% growth. As you know, our strategy focus is on building networks and platforms as the foundation for innovation and growth. Underpinning our success is the consistent investment in these networks and platforms, which position us to take advantage of growth opportunities in the rapidly evolving wireless and wireline markets for broadband, video, and cloud services. Operationally, we are focused on increasing value by delivering products and services to customers in the most efficient and effective way possible. In wireless, our Share Everything plans are a great example. We have simplified decisions for customers, making it easy to add new devices and manage their shared data usage. Our FiOS Quantum offer, where customers can upgrade broadband speeds themselves, is another example of improving service quality and increasing operational efficiency. Throughout the entire business, there are many examples where Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles are being adopted, and we are realizing efficiency gains in a number of areas, including customer care, supply chain, and system support. As we move through the year, we are confident that successful execution in our key strategic areas will continue to drive incremental revenue and promote operating efficiency, resulting in sustainable growth in free cash flow and earnings. Let me shift now to our second quarter performance, hitting a few highlights. Our wireless results were strong, once again effectively balancing growth and profitability. We added 941,000 retail post-paid connections, up nearly 40% sequentially. Service revenue grew more than 8%, EBITDA growth was up double digits, and our EBITDA service margin was 49.8%, solidly within our annual margin guidance. We also had a strong quarter of customer and revenue growth in FiOS. Revenues were up nearly 15%, and we added 161,000 new subscribers in FiOS internet and 140,000 in FiOS video, roughly 20% more than we added in the second quarter last year. In global enterprise, strategic services revenue grew 4.8%. Our consistent operating performance, together with disciplined capital spending, is driving higher free cash flow. Through the first half of the year, free cash flow increased by more than 20%, resulting in an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. Now let\u2019s take a brief look at consolidated results, starting with slide four. Total operating revenue grew 4.3%, sustaining our solid top line growth performance. For the quarter, the increase in consolidated revenues, coupled with effective cost management, resulted in 11.8% growth in adjusted operating income. On an adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased to $10.5 billion, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 90 basis points to 35.1%. Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on slide five. We have emphasized that consistent investment in wireless drives our leadership in network quality, reliability, and the overall customer experience. Our commitment to 4G LTE covers a wide range of activities, including the securing of necessary spectrum, the allocation and deployment of capital for both coverage and capacity, our leadership in fostering a robust device and application ecosystem, and the success of our Share Everything plans in driving device adoption and stimulating usage. Once again, our second quarter wireless results demonstrate the effective execution of this strategy. Total wireless revenues grew to $20 billion, representing 67% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue. We sustained strong service revenue growth of 8.3%, making it the third consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 8%. EBITDA increased to $8.5 billion, and our EBITDA service margin expanded by 80 basis points year over year to 49.8%, representing another very strong quarter of growth and profitably. Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide six. Service revenue growth continues to be driven by increasing connections, smartphone penetration gains, and data usage. The simplicity and value proposition of our Share Everything plans is driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage, resulting in increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account. During the second quarter, retail post-paid service revenue per account, or RPA, grew 6.4% to $152.50 per month. We have 35 million post-paid accounts, and the average connection per account increased to 2.7, up 5.5%. Our Share Everything plans have been very successful. The plans have been available since June 28 of last year, and customer adoption has been very strong. In just one year, more than 36% of our post-paid accounts are on a Share Everything plan. The value proposition is simple and straightforward, and customers increasingly recognize the value of shared data across multiple devices. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide 7. As I highlighted earlier, we added 941,000 new retail post-paid connections, up from 677,000 in the first quarter, and about 6% higher than a year ago. We also added 97,000 retail prepaid connections, so our retail net connections totaled just over 1 million in the quarter. As I stated on our last earnings call, we expect to continue to see sequential quarterly net add improvement in 2013. Total retail connections topped the 100 million mark in the quarter. Our industry-leading post-paid base stood at 94.3 million, and we have more than 5.8 million prepaid connections. Our connections growth was driven by another strong quarter of gross additions. Postpaid gross adds of 3.6 million were up 14.2% year over year. The number of customer upgrades also increased by sequentially and year over year, with a postpaid upgrade rate of 7% for the quarter. We continue to expect that our annual upgrade rate will be about the same as last year. Our upgrades remain high quality, with 36% of customers purchasing a smartphone for the first time. We also maintained a high quality mix within our postpaid net adds. We added 472,000 in the phone category. Of this total, 974,000 were smartphones, with the balance representing the decline in basic phones. We added 371,000 internet devices, including tablets. The balance of just below 100,000 included Home Phone Connect, Home Fusion, and other connected devices. Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Retail postpaid churn was 0.93%. The sequential improvement was due primarily to an expected reduction in involuntary churn, as discussed coming out of the first quarter. Next, let\u2019s turn to slide eight and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations totaled 10.1 million in the quarter, representing both a sequential and year over year increase. We had a high quality device mix once again, with 88% of the activations being phones. Smartphone activations totaled 7.5 million, and 72% of them were 4G LTE. The smartphone mix was fairly balanced; roughly 51% of the activations were iPhones. Our smartphone penetration continued to improve, and we ended the quarter at over 64%. We had another strong quarter for internet devices. Activations of these devices, which include mobile hotspots, jet packs, and tablets, topped 1 million again this quarter. Adoption of 4G LTE smartphones and devices continued to accelerate. One-third of our retail postpaid connections are now 4G LTE, compared to just 12% one year ago. 46% of our smartphones, and more than two-thirds of our internet devices are 4G LTE. Currently, 59% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network, which is five times more efficient than the 3G network. In terms of geographic coverage, we now cover 500 U.S. markets with 4G LTE, and have essentially completed our buildout by matching our 3G footprint. Our LTE network covers more than 99% of our 3G footprint, and when you include our rural America partners, LTE is available to about 301 million across the nation. Throughout the rest of this year, we will continue to invest, adding capacity to our existing 4G coverage, ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices. I will cover our capital spending outlook in more detail during our discussion of cash flows. Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment, starting on slide nine. Our wireline investments and platforms, such as FiOS, global IP, security, cloud services, and machine-to-machine, enable us to deliver the services and leading-edge applications and solutions that customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient, and will help improve our cost structure in the long run. Total wireline revenues decreased 2% in the second quarter, as growth in FiOS and strategic services were offset by softer global enterprise and wholesale revenue from legacy transport services and CPE. In terms of wireline segment margin, second quarter EBITDA increased to $2.2 billion, and the margin was 22.2%, up 80 basis points sequentially. We continue to believe we can improve the wireline segment margin in 2014. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the revenue components, starting on slide 10. In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive signs, highlighted by sustained FiOS revenue growth. Consumer revenues grew 4.7%, driven by FiOS, which now represents 71% of consumer revenue. Our overall consumer monthly RPU increased 9.4% to more than $109, and we sustained a blended FiOS RPU at over $150 per month. Two-thirds of our FiOS customers are triple play, which have a higher amount of recurring revenue per month. As I highlighted earlier, we had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In terms of broadband, we had 161,000 new FiOS internet additions and now have 5.8 million subscribers, representing penetration of 39%. Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 45,000. In FiOS video, we added 140,000 new subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 5 million, which is over 34% penetration. In addition to the customer growth and increased penetration, we are also gaining traction with our FiOS Quantum offers for higher broadband speeds. Sales of our FiOS internet product, at speeds in excess of 50 MB per second, increased during the quarter, and existing customers continue to buy up in the speed. At the end of the quarter, one-third of FiOS internet customers subscribed to Quantum, with speeds ranging from 50 to 300 MB per second. We continue to make steady progress with copper migrations, increasing the number of service upgrades each quarter. During the second quarter, we converted more than 86,000 customers. Through the first half, our total was 169,000, so we are more than halfway to our target of 300,000 for the year. This network evolution initiative is important for us as we reduce our dependency on older technologies. Aside from the maintenance expense savings, and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional RPU over time. Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail residential connections declined by 5.2%, compared with a loss of 6.6% at this time last year. We expect that continued strength of FiOS, the copper migration initiative, and the benefits of labor contracts and work rule flexibility will have a positive effect on wireline profitably this year. Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next, on slide 11. In the second quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $184 million, or 4.8%. CPE sales, which were down 34% year over year, represented $162 million of the decrease. Excluding the decline in CPE, global enterprise revenue was down less than 1% on a year over year basis. Strategic services, which now comprise 57% of enterprise revenue, grew 4.8%. In the second quarter, the continued decline in legacy transport services more than offset the growth in strategic services. We continue to work through economic challenges in the enterprise space. Many of our customers are focused on improving their cost structure, which can result in reduced services with us. In addition, many customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions. Moving next to global wholesale, quarterly revenues declined $141 million, or 7.7%, due primarily to continued declines in the transport services. Again, our strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to next-generation Ethernet services. In terms of profitably, while growth in the enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in the rest of global enterprise and wholesale continue to put pressure on wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling efforts, which we believe will improve our operating efficiency. Let\u2019s turn to slide 12 for a discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation remained very strong. For the first half of this year, cash flows from operations increased by 12%. Free cash flow was up by more than 21%. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4 billion and were $7.6 billion year to date, up 2.5%. Wireless capital spending in the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion. Through the first half, wireless capex totaled $4.3 billion, 8.6% higher than last year. As I noted earlier, we have essentially completed our initial LTE buildout by matching our 3G footprint. Throughout the rest of the year, we will continue to invest by adding capacity to our existing coverage as we begin to deploy AWS spectrum throughout the network. In wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $2.9 billion year to date, which was down 5.9% from last year. Strong connections growth, driven by 4G LTE, and our Share Everything plans, has resulted in higher demand forecasts and a need for increased capital investment. As such, we are increasing our full year capital spending outlook from flat at $16.2 billion to between $16.4 billion and $16.6 billion. We remain focused on improving investment returns and capital efficiency, and we continue to expect our capex to revenue ratio for the full year to improve, even with the additional investments in 4G LTE. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was just under $50 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. Let\u2019s summarize on slide 13. Our second quarter results showed consistently good performance in the key strategic growth areas, so at the halfway point, the key year to date financial and operating metrics are strong: consolidated revenue growth of 4.2%; operating income up 15.6%; adjusted earnings of $1.41 per share, representing 14.6% growth. In wireless, service revenue growth up a very strong 8.4%; average revenue per account up 6.7%; retail post-paid additions of 1.6 million, up 16.5%; EBITDA growth of 14%, and an EBITDA service margin of 50.1%. We are on track to deliver on our 49-50% margin guidance for the full year. In wireline, consumer revenue growth of 4.5%, driven by FiOS growth of nearly 15%, 349,000 subscribers in FiOS internet, and 309,000 in FiOS video. We are on track to meet our 600,000-plus FiOS customer growth target. Free cash flow generation is up better than 20% year over year, and our balance sheet remains very strong. All in all, a very good first half. We are now focused on continuing the momentum, which should result in a strong second half of the year. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Fran, thank you. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick - JPMorgan : Two around wireless. First, you talked about sequential improvements in adds in the third and fourth quarter. Given that Sprint\u2019s not going to be seeding a number of items into the market, in what\u2019s traditionally not a strong third quarter, can you help us see why you\u2019re more confident there? And second, can you talk about how you expect margins to track through the remainder of this year? Given the upgrade comment you just made about being flat year over year, that\u2019s a little higher than I would have thought given the commentary, or the change for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about those?\nFran Shammo : On the sequential third and fourth quarter, it\u2019s similar to the trend that we saw last year when coming out of the first and second quarter. We said we would sequentially continue to see growth in the third and fourth quarter. And again, this is around what we expect the roadmap to be on additional device launches throughout the third and fourth quarter. But the momentum that we have, and you see that momentum coming out of second quarter, and I\u2019ll talk more to that in a second when we get to the margins, we continue to see this high-quality subscriber coming onto the wireless 4G LTE network, and we don\u2019t see that changing at this point. From a Sprint and porting ratio, I won\u2019t get into specific individual carriers, but again, pretty consistently positive with all carriers from a porting ratio perspective. On the margin side of the house, I think we have to put this in perspective. Again, we are fully engaged on the 49-50% guidance that I gave to you in the beginning of the year , and if you look at the first half of the year at 50.1% for the first half and coming out of this quarter at 49.8%. And I think you have to look at what\u2019s behind that. So if you look at, on a year over year basis, just between the quarters, we improved our profitably by 80 basis points. In that, if you look at that, we moved 7.5 million smartphones. 1.6 million of that was additional smartphones over last year. And then if you just look at the 4G devices, we moved 3.1 million more 4G devices this year than we did a year ago. And in that, if you look at the service revenue growth of 8.3%, that\u2019s up 100 basis points over where we were last year. So you can see the quality of these adds, and if you take what we added in the quarter of nets, with 472,000 net phone, it\u2019s a pretty good indication of what we\u2019re going to drive from a margin perspective. And then if you look at the network side of this, with 4G LTE, we now have 33% of our customers on that network, 36% of our customers on shared. We had a growth of 5.5% in the connected devices. And I\u2019ve said that our growth is really dependent on two things. Number one, the 4G LTE network, and as people move over there, the usage of stimulation drives them into higher tiers from a tier perspective on the shared plan. And then of course the second piece is, as they get on the shared plan, they start to connect all these additional devices. And you can see that with the continued momentum of our internet category and some other things that will be coming to market similar to what we did in the fourth quarter last year as for the camera. So, combination of all these. I am very confident that we will continue on the margin track that we set out at the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs : Fran, there\u2019s been obviously some buzz around Verizon investing in Canada. Maybe you can help us in terms of where you see the opportunity. Is this tied into a roaming footprint? Is it tied to maybe serving your own enterprise customer base? Or is there sort of a consumer retail presence you might have in mind tied to this? And then second question, on FiOS, very good volumes in what\u2019s generally a seasonally weak quarter. You talked about the 600 plus, that it seems like you have the opportunity to maybe be meaningfully above that result. I\u2019m just wondering, does what you\u2019ve seen in Q2 give you the opportunity to maybe set the bar higher for the year?\nFran Shammo : On Canada, again, let me emphasize this is really an exploratory exercise for us. As you all know, they\u2019ve delayed their spectrum auction until January. So, again, we continue to just look at this market. I think it\u2019s everything that you said that we\u2019re kind of looking at. If you look at the population of Canada, about 70% of that population is between Toronto and Quebec. That\u2019s adjacent to the Verizon Wireless properties. Again, if you look at the spectrum auction, it mirrors up exactly what we launched here in the United States on the 700 MHz contiguous footprint. So we\u2019re looking at all these, but obviously some of the cautions here are the regulatory environment, a foreign investor coming into the Canadian market and what does that mean? So again, cautiously looking at it. Not ready to make any announcements today. And we continue to explore and have discussions, but at this point it\u2019s just really an exploratory exercise. On the FiOS volumes, again we put a lot of effort around continuing the superiority of the FiOS product. Bobby and his team have done a great job in and around the FiOS Quantum offers and a lot of the stimulated growth that we see here is coming from the Quantum offers that we have, and upgrading those Quantum offers to the 50 and 70 MB per second services. So look, we set a target for 600,000. Obviously if we can exceed that target, we will. We\u2019re ahead of that target, but I will tell you that the third quarter, again, is always a seasonally challenging quarter for us from a move perspective. So let\u2019s continue on the track that we are, and if we can overdeliver, we will, but we\u2019ve set the target at 600,000.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS : Quick question on wireline and then wireless. First, on wireline, Fran, in your prepared remarks you mentioned a couple of issues driving wireline profitability, that you see some improvement. I just wanted to see if I could get a little clarification. Are you talking about the year over year trends for the whole year? Or just the second half? If you could just sort of fill in the blanks for us, that would be great. And then secondly, on the wireless capex increase, can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that? Is it more 4G devices? Is it more usage per device? Or is it maybe the competitive environment and what you\u2019re seeing from other carriers? What\u2019s really driving the change there?\nFran Shammo : So in wireline possibility, look, we set the bar that said our margin would be flat year over year. Going into obviously in the third and fourth quarters of last year, compared to what we think we can do this year, and coming out of the second quarter, I think in the back half I have to improve the profitability in order to continue to make that guidance that we set out at the beginning of the year that said we would be flat on a margin basis. So I think we\u2019re on course to do that, and mathematically, the profit has to get better in the back half of the year in order to sustain that guidance. As far as the capex on wireless goes, there\u2019s a couple of things here that are driving this. If you look at, over the last three quarters, the growth that we\u2019ve had, the number of 4G devices we\u2019ve moved, and if you look at just the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, we\u2019ve added 6.2 million more 4G devices on the 4G network than we had a year ago, from just an overall sale perspective. So when you look at that and you look at the usage, currently 59% of the data traffic is now running on the 4G network. And that\u2019s being driven by 33% of the base. So again, from just a growth perspective on the top line, we\u2019ve always said, again, that as customers move into shared, and they realize the viability and speeds, and the consistency of this 4G network, it\u2019s going to drive them to use higher usage. And if you look at where video\u2019s going in the future, obviously that\u2019s going to continue the proliferation of the usage on this network. And we look out two years ahead of where we think our curve is going to be, and given the past success we\u2019ve had, and the usage patterns, and the amount of 4G devices that we\u2019ve already moved, and the roadmap that we see coming, we need to accelerate really the capacity that we previously thought. And it\u2019s really all to drive what customers want. So the incremental investment will more than pay for itself on top line growth, from what I see. And again, this is really a shift in our capital discipline between wireline and wireless. And we\u2019re going to maintain our lead on the most reliable, consistent 4G LTE network. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the increase for the capex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Other wireless service revenues were very strong, up about 20% year over year. I imagine you\u2019ve got some MBNOs and maybe roaming and other stuff. Perhaps you could just comment on the drivers of that and the sustainability of that. And then on the enterprise side, you talked about continued cautious behavior and cost focus. Do you see any signs of a second half pickup? I think there\u2019s some better news on unemployment and generally macro trends improving in the second half. Are you seeing any of that? Or is it pretty much static from your point of view?\nFran Shammo : On the other wireless revenue, obviously what\u2019s included in that other wireless revenue is our reseller base. I don\u2019t like to refer to them as MBNOs. That\u2019s a bad word for me. But on the reseller base, it\u2019s really driven from the prepaid providers that we have on that side of the business. And again, coming out of this quarter, we did a fairly substantial number of net adds there. And again, our prepay strategy is between what we sell on the retail side under our own brand, and we had a positive quarter again this quarter, with 97,000 net adds. But we also drive the, if you want, the lower-end market through resellers, and mainly through the relationship with Walmart, through Tracfone. So that drives a lot of volume, and that has been good revenue growth for us. The other things I would tell you, though, is that in addition to that, obviously roaming is in there, machine-to-machine , which we don\u2019t really talk about much. We\u2019re gaining a lot of momentum around machine-to-machine, and that is driving incremental revenue, albeit very low individual unit per subscriber type revenues, but again, as we start to gain momentum and sell hundreds and hundreds of thousands of these types of devices, that\u2019s going to contribute to those revenues and contribute to the overall growth of wireless. So that\u2019s the component of that. On the enterprise side, look, I understand the unemployment is there, but it\u2019s not large enough and steady enough to give me confidence that something\u2019s going to turn here in the near future. And again, if you look at the enterprise space, mainly what everybody is focused on is cutting their costs. And obviously when we talk about cutting costs in enterprise, they come to us and figure out how they can reduce their spend with Verizon and have us give them solutions that help them reduce their spend. And of course we\u2019re happy to do that, but it does cause some top line pressure. And also, I think, again, the uncertainty of what\u2019s going on around the government sector, is twofold. Number one, a lot of this pressure in enterprise this quarter, if you look at the decline of 4.8%, over 60% of that was in the government sector for us this quarter. So there is a big impact from the sequestering activity and the pullback from both the state and local governments, and also within the federal government. As I look forward, though, the uncertainty around this tax situation, and if you think about it, we\u2019re now midway through the year, it\u2019s highly unlikely that we\u2019ll get tax reform this year. So again, we\u2019re faced with another cliff at the end of the year if congress does not extend the tax provisions that are currently on the books for another year. So hopefully they\u2019ll do that soon and put some of the uncertainty to rest, at least until the next 18 months, until we can get to all the difficult issues around tax reform, which as you know we have a lot of subgroups working in Washington to help and give suggestions on how to get this done. But that\u2019s going to take some time. Again, it\u2019s hard for companies to say we\u2019re going to invest in new technologies and new things, when we\u2019re not certain what the future of the tax laws hold for the books and records. So I still don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to change drastically from where we are. And as I said before, at least from where I sit, the best we can hope for is a flat performance, and if you take CPE out of the equation this quarter, we\u2019re at a [0.8%] decline. So that\u2019s probably about where we\u2019ll be, zero to slightly decline, or slightly positive is kind of where I\u2019m at at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research : Could you just give us the update on the net debt calculation for Verizon Wireless? And then with respect to the business, I think the metrics that you threw out there on the LTE network implies about 1.8 more usage on the LTE network versus the 3G network. And I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more, and maybe give us a sense of what the usage trends are for your customers. And as they move into the shared data plans, if you could give us a sense of that kind of stimulus that you\u2019re seeing on the consumption front.\nFran Shammo : On the update of the net debt for wireless growth, that is $10.1 billion, and net debt is $9.7 billion. And as you know, we did a distribution at the end of June of a total of $7 billion out of the partnership to both of the owners. And also, just to keep in focus here, we have about $1.5 billion of wireless debt coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another approximately $3.5 billion coming due in the first quarter of next year, and we plan to pay that debt off at that point in time. On the LTE network, you\u2019re right on. Obviously what\u2019s happening is as people come from the 3G network over to the 4G network, you can see that incremental usage, whether it\u2019s a smartphone or a jet pack or a dongle. And as they start to share all this data, the video consumption is increasing year over year and quarter over quarter. Others in the industry have put out their projections of usage over the 4G data, if you look at some of the things that people have printed, and the escalation that the future holds from a data consumption standpoint as we start to move into more symmetry between in the home and out of the home content. We don\u2019t see that slowing, so again, yes, we do see an incredible jump when someone moves from 3G to 4G and the usage that they have on their smartphones and other devices. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura. Your line is open.\nMike McCormack - Nomura : Maybe just a comment on wireless margin. I know you\u2019ve got the sort of 49-50% expectation for the full year. Last year the fourth quarter had very high volumes that sort of really dragged down margins a bit. Are you getting comfort that the new upgrade policy should have a muting impact on that? And then just secondly, on FiOS competition, maybe just some comments regarding the triple play pricing environment out there, and also how well you\u2019re doing in the [MDU] market.\nFran Shammo : On the wireless margins, obviously, again, we\u2019re very confident around the 49-50%. As far as the fourth quarter of last year, you have to keep in mind it was the first quarter that there was a free iPhone on the Verizon Wireless network, and we won\u2019t have that repeated this fourth quarter. Now, that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t see increasing volume. And again, I continue to say that we\u2019ll see incremental net adds through the third and into the fourth quarter. But from a margin perspective, if you look at just year over year and the amount of volume we\u2019ve moved, we actually ate through all that volume and improved the profitability of this business. And that goes into managing the entire business. So from an upgrade policy standpoint, some other things that we\u2019ll be launching. You probably saw Verizon Edge and some other options that we\u2019ll have on payment plans for our customers to acquire a smartphone. All of these things considered, we are very, very positive on the margin progress and the profitability progress of Verizon Wireless and the continued growth of Verizon Wireless.\nMike McCormack - Nomura : Just on the Edge comment, is that something that you\u2019re hearing your customers actually demanding, the sort of equipment financing option?\nFran Shammo : If you look back, we were the first carrier to launch LTE technology, we were the first ones to launch the shared pricing around LTE technology. We launched in the fourth quarter of last year an installment pay plan on tablets. That was something that our customers were asking for. We delivered that to them. And at that point in time, we started to look at it, and I said we were looking at other options for smartphones. We\u2019ve done a lot of focus groups in the last six months. We\u2019ve done a lot of market research. And yes, our customers are asking for another option. Twofold: Number one, we have a lot of customers on the technology edge that want to be able to upgrade sooner than they would under our historical legacy subsidy model, if you will. And we have other customers who quite honestly don\u2019t want to pay up front for the large cost of the phone. They\u2019d rather pay over time. So I\u2019m not going to get into all the details of Verizon Edge, I\u2019ll let Wireless do that, but that\u2019s something that our customers have been asking for, and I think we have a differentiated plan to launch to the market and Verizon Wireless will have more to say on that. Going back to your other question on triple play and MDU, obviously we continue to gain momentum here. Look, this business has always been competitive around the triple play, but I think what\u2019s differentiating us right now is the superiority of our product with fiber into the home. And as you get that fiber into the home, I think what customers are realizing, and we see this with the copper to fiber migration, when they move, and they see the speed that they can get on their internet capacity, we\u2019re seeing customers upgrade. And what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re seeing our legacy copper customers, who we have migrated over to the FiOS network, they are paying between $10 and $15 more in RPU a month after about 60 days on our network, because they\u2019re upgrading freely into that 30 and 50 MB per second. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s differentiating us in the market. We will continue to advertise around that superiority, and I think that momentum will carry us into the third and fourth quarters.\nMike McCormack - Nomura : Just a quick follow up on the FiOS side. Is there a point at which you guys are going to migrate to an all-IP video network?\nFran Shammo : Obviously we\u2019ve already started that with the copper to fiber migration, but that\u2019s going to be quite some time in order to deactivate the copper switches and take all that plant and equipment out. We have the plans to do that, but that\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to be done within this year or next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo : I did want to ask about prepay. With AT&T doing [AIO] and now with Leap\u2019s purchase and Cricket in the fold, and T-Mobile and Sprint obviously having their own brands, is there any interest on your part in launching an independent prepay brand under Verizon, separate from Verizon?\nFran Shammo : I think from a prepay perspective, we are very happy with how we approach this market, between our own prepaid product, which obviously you\u2019ve heard me talk about in the past, which is just strictly on our 3G network. We do not offer prepaid on the 4G LTE network. And as I said, we will become more aggressive over time in the prepaid market on that 3G network. Because again, as we look at the 3G versus the 4G, and we move 3G customers into our 4G network, we want to make sure that we keep that 3G network as full as possible, because when you think from an investment return, we\u2019re not investing any more in that network, and the fuller we can keep that network without detrimenting the service, the contribution margin of that network is very, very high. So prepaid is really the pillar of how we will continue to utilize that 3G network, so you\u2019ll see us become more aggressive around that when we need to be. You saw us change some pricing in the last two quarters around prepaid, and that has stimulated some growth for us. And then as I said previously, our other path is through resellers for the lower end market. I don\u2019t see the need, at this point, to do a secondary brand around the Verizon Wireless network. We have built our brand around the quality, the reliability, a superior network. I don\u2019t think that a secondary brand helps our overall brand at that point. The other thing I\u2019ll say is I\u2019m not going to comment on anything around the AT&T deal with Leap, but I will put to bed the rumors out there that Verizon Wireless may be interested in that asset. And [hear me], we\u2019re not interested in that asset.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank : I\u2019m not going to ask you about Leap, but that deal is spectrum-driven, and you guys have indicated that you\u2019re starting to deploy your AWS-1 spectrum, and maybe that\u2019s happening a little sooner than we thought, although you\u2019re seeing network traffic ramp very quickly. I\u2019m just curious if you can maybe give us a status update on your spectrum portfolio. Do you still feel like you have sufficient spectrum to get to the next auction? Do you still see an opportunity to buy spectrum in the market right now from other carriers? And have you started to think about maybe some supplemental solutions, for example maybe revisiting wifi, as another way to put capacity into your network?\nFran Shammo : Around spectrum, we did our AWS deal last year, and that put us in a very good spot for our 4G LTE strategy. We started to launch AWS last year. We started to preposition that. We are accelerating the positioning of the AWS based on my comments before around the usage around wireless. But again, we are very comfortable with our spectrum holdings, and we are in good shape for three to four years. Obviously we will participate in the auction with the FCC targeted for 2014 around the broadcast licenses. That\u2019s something that we will participate in. But we are not under any spectrum pressure. If you look at our frequencies, and the way we deployed our CDMA spectrum, we can actually take very small slivers out of that CDMA spectrum and reallocate that to our 4G LTE spectrum on a needed basis. And that\u2019s where we get into this balancing act between the 3G network and the 4G network. But we are very satisfied with our holdings for the next three to four years. Obviously we\u2019re always opportunistic in spectrum acquisition, and we do actually buy spectrum every quarter. You probably don\u2019t see it, because we do little markets here and there. But look, we\u2019re always opportunistic, but at this point, we\u2019re satisfied, and there\u2019s nothing out there at this point other than the auction that we\u2019re concentrating on.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank : And on wifi, anything new there maybe involving your cable partners?\nFran Shammo : From a wifi perspective, obviously we always like people to offload when they\u2019re in their home on a secured wifi network. You\u2019ve heard me talk before about wifi networks are not secure in the public domain. They have a purpose for us in certain instances around major sporting events and so forth, but our customers are very concerned about their privacy and security. That\u2019s why they ride the LTE network as much as they do. But we do want offload in certain circumstances, and so that does relieve some of the spectrum. We obviously, just from a utilization standpoint, for people that are in their homes, it\u2019s not good and efficient to run off the LTE network. They should shift over to their wifi network in their house. So we do encourage that, but again, not major, massive, public wifi is interesting for our customers, at least at this point in time, from a security standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just following up a little bit on that, Fran, I was wondering if you could give us a status update on the activities and development that\u2019s going on inside that joint innovation entity with the Comcast group, and what progress, if any, is being made on some of the digital content rights stuff? And then I guess second would be kind of along those lines. Could you elaborate a little bit on your relationship with NFL, and kind of some of the strategy behind that content relationship and if that\u2019s the beginning of a series of potential new moves to acquire content? And if I could, just one quick last one, I noticed the strategic services sales and enterprise were a a little over 6% growth year over year last quarter. They kind of slowed down into the 4% zipcode this quarter. I know overall enterprise has been fairly soft, but strategic services has been kind of a core strength. If you could kind of address that slowdown, it would be helpful.\nFran Shammo : Around our joint venture with the cable companies, obviously our [unintelligible] solutions team has been working and defining consumers as to what they want both in the home and outside the home. And obviously what we\u2019re learning is the 4G LTE network plays a very critical role in that. We continue to work with them. We have expanded into 968 Verizon Wireless stores across the U.S., and we have about 2,500 indirect locations, the marketing material, and we continue to showcase these types of products. But I will say that as we continue to work through this, it\u2019s hard for Verizon Wireless to sell a cable product outside of the FiOS footprint, because it\u2019s new. And it\u2019s hard for the cable companies to sell a wireless product outside the footprint, because of the distribution channels. So as we continue to work through this, we\u2019re gaining some momentum here. But I think the one last point from all this is we\u2019re obviously very focused on the content rights. And you come into the NFL agreement, and the NFL agreement we think is just a new way of how content rights can be delivered into the wireless segment. And obviously our strategy is around both type of multicasting a live sporting event, and you saw our comments that the 2014 Super Bowl will be a multicast type event to our wireless customers. So that\u2019s really the breakdown of the wall between what can be delivered in the home and out of the home. And obviously we now have the rights to take some of the NFL live games out of the home and deliver them on the mobile devices. From a content standpoint, this has to develop, obviously, over time. The other point here around content is we are starting to see where we\u2019re getting inquiries from content providers that they may want to pay for their content rather than having the consumer pay. Those models are still being worked, but we\u2019ll see where that goes. But I look at that as the old 1-800 number, where the actual vendor pays for the usage, and not the customer. So we\u2019ll see how that strategy develops over the course of time. As far as our strategic services go, we continue to have good momentum in our strat services as we refine exactly what we\u2019re doing. We have very good momentum in the Terremark and the Hughes platforms, and around our cloud services. The slowdown, quite honestly, has been around our PIP exercise, and that is growing, but it\u2019s more a price compression within the industry. So we\u2019re facing some of that going forward. And we knew we were going to face some price compression around PIP, and we have to accelerate on the other strategic services to outpace that. So, other than that, we have good momentum on strat services.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just to clarify, PIP is?\nFran Shammo : IP-based solutions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Seitz of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTom Seitz - Jefferies : Can you just give us an update on your expectations for VoLTE?\nFran Shammo : We\u2019re still on course for VoLTE. We will start testing and have our first handset in the market at the end of the year. And then we will probably commercial launch sometime next year. But again, as I\u2019ve said in the past, the critical piece for us is that we have to make sure that our 4G LTE coverage footprint from a VoLTE standpoint equates to our 3G footprint, because the VoLTE call is not backwards compatible with the CDMA network. So when you establish a call on VoLTE, within our network, if you move outside of the LTE network, you will have a hard drop on that call. And obviously that\u2019s not something that our customers would expect from a premium provider like Verizon Wireless. So we\u2019re taking our time here. We will thoroughly test this. But we are on track to commercially launch sometime in the first half of next year. And then taking that out, as I\u2019ve said, at the end of next year, we are on track to have our first only LTE handset to be able to provide to the marketplace as well. So we\u2019re still on track with our VoLTE strategy, but it is a critical one for us to make sure that we get right when we launch.\nTom Seitz - Jefferies : So the implication, though, then, is that the 4G network is going to be essentially everywhere that the 3G network is by sometime in the first half of next year?\nFran Shammo : The 4G network is everywhere. As I said in my opening remarks, 99% of the coverage of our 4G network is equivalent to our 3G network. But now we have to go back in and fill in that capacity to make sure that from a voice call perspective, it will hand off, because voice is different than the data piece. So we just have to make sure that a customer who is on 3G today, when they go to VoLTE, they would see no difference in their service from 3G to 4G.\nTom Seitz - Jefferies : Could I just follow up on Dave\u2019s question? There were press reports that ESPN was considering subsidizing mobile video consumption. And you sort of alluded to that as well. How soon do you think we\u2019ll see a material third party payer model? Is it this year? Is it next? Is it a couple of years out? Can you just sort of frame the timeframe of what you\u2019re thinking about?\nFran Shammo : I think the big barrier right now is how does the content provider get the value of how many people watch their content on a mobile device to be able to go back to their advertisers in order to monetize that content? And right now that\u2019s where the barrier is, and we\u2019re working on that. But until that get solved, I think this model will be slow at this point in time. Now, slow to come, I\u2019m thinking maybe next year. But it\u2019s certainly not any time in this year that that model will break through. Because they have to recognize the benefit back to their advertisers to be able to monetize that content into our network. But it is something that\u2019s being discussed. They realize that the linear model will not work as it does in TV in the wireless market. You can\u2019t assume that someone\u2019s going to pay $8 a sub on 100 million subs, so that model does not work. So we are looking at other models, but the barrier is how do you measure everything to get back to the advertisers for the perceived value on that content?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Just on the capital expenditure front, on the back of this capital expenditure rise for the year, I wanted to ask how we should think about the capital intensity of the business going forward. It does seem as though your competitors are healthily ramping their efforts to try and improve service quality. Do you feel as though you\u2019ll need to continue to put your foot on the gas in order to maintain the quality of your network?\nFran Shammo : Well, let\u2019s put this in perspective. We\u2019ve moved our consensus by $200 million to $400 million, so this is not a huge step up in our capital spend. We just wanted to make sure everybody realized that we were going to accelerate some of the 4G LTE. But as we\u2019ve said in the past, and if you look at our results through the first half of the year, we continue to really be disciplined around the capital investment across our businesses, but also within the wireline segments. So you see that come down year over year. We expect that trend to continue. So that will offset some of the pressure that we may see on the wireless side. So I don\u2019t anticipate that there\u2019s going to be any major accelerations, but again, it\u2019s too soon to tell where we\u2019re going to come out in \u201913. I\u2019ll talk more about that in the coming quarters, but right now the focus is on this year and it\u2019s between $200 million and $400 million increment.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays : If I may, we\u2019ve clearly seen a pickup in terms of your shared data plans. I think you mentioned that it\u2019s more than 36% of your subscribers that are on these plans. I was thinking from a strategic perspective, as we\u2019ve seen increased promotional activities by some of your competitors to try and wean subscribers onto their networks, do you feel as though this is a potential mode in terms of protecting your subscriber base from some of these more aggressive pricing plans that are available in the market? Should we expect to see more promotional activity to try and ratchet this sort of percent of subscribers on shared data plans up in the coming quarters?\nFran Shammo : This industry has always been an extremely competitive industry, and obviously some of the promotions around unlimited have been there for the last year, when we launched share pricing. And we continue to take market share, we continue to grow our revenue very strongly. So look, I mean, Verizon Wireless will do one thing very well. They will compete very well in the market, but we are a balanced company. We will compete, grow revenue, grow profitability, and grow our subscribers. And at the end of the day, customers make choices not really just on price, but the quality of the network, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve built our brand on. So quality of the network, consistency of the network, the reliability of the network, the value that we provide to our customers through these shared plans. And again, will we do promos here and there? Of course. As I said before, we\u2019ll launch the Verizon Edge, which will give our customers yet another choice of how do they want to enter onto the best network there. So I think the key here is give our customers choice, and continue with what we\u2019ve built our company on, which is the strongest network.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer : Two questions on wireless. Fran, you talked about the fact that your LTE network is enabling you to attract a higher quality customer, which has clearly been the case for a long time with your network. But do you have any evidence on that on maybe credit scores? Are you finding with what you\u2019ve done on LTE and the shared data plans, are you attracting higher credit quality scores, maybe losing lower quality score customers? And then secondly, on the shared data plans, can you maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of customers needing to increase their data buckets or many customers bumping up against headroom? Or do you expect to see an acceleration of that in the next year? Or is it more like two to three years out?\nFran Shammo : On the high quality, obviously we give a lot of our customers choice of various price plans and how to enter into our superior network. And of course credit scores have always been a component of that. I won\u2019t really get into how we differentiate the credit scores, but obviously you can see that from the growth that we have and the revenue growth that we have, this is not a major issue for us. And we watch this very closely, but we\u2019re gaining customers across all aspects of the business, let\u2019s just put it that way. Shared data plan, as far as acceleration of data usage, again, what we see, and if you\u2019ve experienced this yourselves, we continually communicate with our customers throughout the month as to when they get to their usage, and then when they get up into that 90%, we give them the ability to upgrade through their phone to the next tier. And we see some very good results from that. Customers are upgrading when they need to. So, again, based on our trajectory of data usage, especially with where we see video going, we continue to see that the uptake in the shared plan will continue, the usage will continue to accelerate, and our revenue growth will be reflective of that.\nMichael Stefanski: That\u2019s all the time we have for questions. But before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Fran for some closing comments.\nFran Shammo : Thanks, Mike. I just want to leave just a couple points of emphasis here. Our strategic investments and operational execution drove strong financial performance in the first half of this year. But while we are pleased with the overall performance, we obviously know we have more work to do. We are committed to driving shareholder value by continuing to execute our strategy and improve on the fundamentals of the business. We are focused on delivering superior customer service and providing the best portfolio of products, along with the most reliable and consistent performing network. Our focus is to capture incremental revenue growth in our key strategic areas while we also transform our service delivery and cost structure. As always, we will continue to be very disciplined around our capital investments, investing in those platforms for the innovation and the growth of the future. Through this strategy and execution model, we expect to drive incremental cash flow and earnings growth, both in the second half of this year and into the future. Thank you again for joining us, and everybody have a great day."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-04-18 11:47:10", "content": "Executives: Michael Stefanski - SVP, Investor Relations Fran Shammo - EVP & CFO \nAnalysts: Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley John Hodulik - UBS Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research Mike McCormack - Nomura Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Tom Seitz - Jefferies Tim Horan - Oppenheimer\nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, senior vice president, investor relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with our chief financial officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be available on our website later today. I would also like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.  I would also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature included in our reported earnings results for the first quarter of either this year or last.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran. \nFran Shammo : Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone. We entered this year with strong momentum, and we are seeing our strategic investments driving an excellent start to 2013. Earnings per share of $0.68 was up 15.3%. Our investment returns are improving and becoming more evident in our results. Our strategic focus is on building networks and platforms as the foundation for innovation and growth. By investing consistently in these networks and platforms, we have positioned the business to take advantage of growth opportunities in the rapidly evolving markets for broadband, video, and cloud services. Our investments in 4G LTE enables us to provide a superior customer experience in wireless broadband and video. Our investments in fiber to the home enable a leading broadband and video experience to FiOS customers through higher speeds and capacity. Our investments in global IP, managed services, cloud computing, security, and machine-to-machine enable our ability to serve the complex needs of large enterprise customers around the globe. Our operational focus is on execution, which means performing the basics every day. In short, our approach is to meet customer needs by delivering products and services in the most efficient and effective way. Our implementation of Share Everything plans is simplifying decisions for customers, making it easier to upgrade and add devices while eliminating the need for separate data plans for each device. Our FiOS Quantum offer and copper to fiber migration initiative are examples of improving service quality and increasing operational efficiency. In enterprise, our ongoing retooling efforts, which include product rationalization and systems consolidation, will result in a more efficient and effective service delivery model.  Verizon\u2019s Lean Six Sigma principles are being adopted across the entire business, and we are beginning to see efficiency gains in many areas, including customer care, supply chain, and system support, to name a few. As we move through the year, successful execution in our key strategic areas will drive incremental revenue and better operating efficiency, resulting in continued growth in free cash flows and earnings. Let me shift now to our first quarter performance, hitting a few highlights. Our wireless results were strong, striking a favorable balance between growth and profitability. We added 677,000 retail postpaid connections, up 35% year over year. Service revenue grew 8.6%, and our EBITDA service margin was 50.4%, which was right in line with our guidance. FiOS also had a strong quarter of customer and revenue growth. We added 188,000 new FiOS internet subscribers and had 169,000 FiOS video additions. FiOS revenue grew 15.1%, and RPU was over $150 a month. In global enterprise, strategic services revenue continued to increase, up 6% year over year. Free cash flows in the first quarter increased $1.5 billion, or 64%, on the strength of higher cash from operations.  Now let\u2019s take a brief look at consolidated results, starting with slide four. Total operating revenue grew 4.2%, sustaining our solid top line growth performance. For the quarter, the increase in consolidated revenues, coupled with effective cost management, resulted in 19.8% growth in operating income. Consolidated EBITDA also grew at a double digit rate, up 12.1%, while our EBITDA margin expanded by 240 basis points to 35.1%. Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on slide five. Our consistent investment in wireless drives our leadership in network quality, reliability, and the overall customer experience.  Five years ago, we committed to 4G LTE as the next generation technology, and we have taken all the necessary steps to take advantage of this growth opportunity. These actions include securing necessary spectrum, allocating capital to deploy 4G LTE nationwide, fostering a robust device and application ecosystem, and introducing a revolutionary pricing framework with our Share Everything plans for consumer and small business. Once again, through solid execution of our strategy, the wireless results speak for themselves. We also knew that by taking advantage of the unique market growth opportunities in the fourth quarter, we would quickly realize the benefit. Our first quarter results prove this out. Total wireless revenues grew to $19.5 billion, and now represent two-thirds of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue. Our strong momentum in terms of connections growth and smartphone penetration drove first quarter service revenue growth of 8.6%. As expected, profitability rebounded quickly following the high quality device activations of the fourth quarter. EBITDA grew to $8.4 billion, up 18.1%, and our industry leading EBITDA service margins expanded to 50.4%, up 410 basis points over the first quarter of 2012. Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at wireless revenue and accounts, beginning on slide six. The increase in service revenue was driven by a combination of factors, including customer growth and increased smartphone penetration.  The popularity and simplicity of our Share Everything plans is driving increases in both the revenue and number of devices per account. During the first quarter, retail postpaid service revenue per account, or RPA, grew to more than $150 per month, an increase of 6.9%. Connections per account increased to 2.67, up 5.1%. In just nine months, 30% of our postpaid account base is on a Share Everything plan. Customers have quickly recognized the value of shared data across multiple devices. In late January, we also introduced Share Everything plans for small business, which allow for up to 25 devices per account. In terms of the number of postpaid accounts, our Share Everything plans have resulted in consolidation of accounts. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide seven. In the first quarter, we added 677,000 new retail postpaid connections, an increase of 35.1% year over year. Last year, postpaid connections increase sequentially each quarter, and we expect a similar pattern of accelerating growth in 2013.  We have an industry leading 98.9 million retail connections, with 93.2 million postpaid and 5.7 million prepaid. Our postpaid connections represent 34.9 million accounts. Postpaid gross adds in the first quarter totaled 3.5 million, up 15.6% year over year. In terms of upgrades, 6.7% of our postpaid connections base upgraded during the quarter.  Our churn metrics continue to be market leading. Retail postpaid churn was 1.01%. During the quarter, we implemented several process improvements in the area of bad debt collections related to our Lean Six Sigma initiative. These improvements resulted in an acceleration of involuntary churn, which we expect will be lower in future periods. Now let\u2019s turn to slide eight and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. In the first quarter, we activated 9.7 million postpaid devices, 87% of which were phones. Smartphone activations totaled 7.2 million, and 68% of these were 4G LTE. We activated 4 million iPhones. Half of them are 4G LTE and the other half were 3G.  Our smartphone penetration increased to 61%, up from 58% at the end of last year. A key point of differentiation for us and incremental revenue is the improved mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the first quarter, gross adds, or new to Verizon customers, represented about 28% of the total smartphone activations, much higher than the 22-24% range we reported in the first half of 2012. We also have incremental revenue opportunities with upgrades. About 38% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time. I would also note that when customers upgrade from a 3G to a 4G LTE smartphone, they are usually in a shared data plan, enabling higher usage and additional device adoption, which ultimately drives higher revenue per account. Customer adoption of 4G LTE continues to accelerate. At the end of the first quarter, 4G LTE phones and devices represented more than 28% of total retail postpaid connections. 40% of smartphones and 63% of internet devices are now 4G LTE, and 54% of our total data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network, which is 5 times more efficient than 3G. In terms of 4G LTE geographic coverage, we are by far the market leader. Today, our 4G LTE service is available in 491 markets, covering 287 million [pops], representing more than 95% of our 3G coverage.  We will continue to leverage our advantage and expect that our 4G LTE footprint will effectively match our 3G network by the end of the second quarter. Network quality and reliability will continue to be the hallmarks of the Verizon brand, and we will continue to invest to maintain our leadership position. Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment, starting on slide nine. In wireline, our investments in FiOS, global IP, security, cloud, and machine-to-machine provide powerful platforms to deliver the services and leading edge applications and solutions that our customers are looking for. These services are increasingly efficient, and in the long run, will help improve our cost structure. In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive signs, highlighted by 15.1% FiOS revenue growth this quarter. In addition to increasing FiOS penetration, we are focused on improving our operating and capital efficiency. We are also making good progress in our copper to fiber migration program. In enterprise, we continue to see mixed performance. Our strategic service revenue grew 6%, but declines in core services like voice and data transport, as well as CPE more than offset the increase. In terms of wireline profitability, first quarter EBITDA was $2.1 billion, and the margin was 21.4%, roughly flat sequentially if we set aside the impacts of Sandy in the fourth quarter. As we have previously indicated, we do not expect much in the way of total wireline EBITDA margin expansion in 2013. However, the continued strong performance of FiOS, our copper to fiber initiative, and the benefits of new union contracts give us confidence that consumer and mass markets will contribute positively to wireline profit this year. In enterprise, while growth in strategic services continued to improve the revenue mix, secular declines in both retail and wholesale voice and data transport services are putting pressure on wireline profitability. We believe that our ongoing product rationalization efforts and other retooling efforts will ultimately improve our cost structure and result in a fundamentally stronger enterprise business. Looking ahead, we are positioned to improve the wireline margin in 2014, based on better contributions from our strategic investments, which include Redbox Instant, Hughes Telematics, and Verizon Digital Media Services. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the revenue components, starting with mass markets on slide 10. FiOS is the foundation of our growth strategy in the consumer market, and it shows in our first quarter results. Consumer revenues grew 4.3%, driven by increased FiOS revenue, which now represents 69% of consumer revenue. FiOS is also the key driver of growth in overall consumer RPU, which increased to more than $107 per month, up 9.5%. FiOS RPU remains at over $150 per month, and two-thirds of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play, with voice, internet, and video services. As I highlighted earlier, FiOS customer growth was strong in the first quarter. In terms of broadband, we had 188,000 new FiOS internet additions in the quarter, and now have 5.6 million subscribers, representing penetration of 38%. Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 99,000, marking a sharp improvement over the past several quarters.  In FiOS video, we added 169,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.9 million, which is 34% penetration. We continue to make steady progress, upgrading copper services to fiber, increasing the number of upgrades each quarter.  We are off to a strong start, converting about 83,000 homes in the first quarter, with a target of 300,000 for the year. This network evolution initiative is important for us as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technologies throughout the business. Aside from the obvious expense benefits and improvements in customer satisfaction, the conversion to fiber also provides customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional RPU over time. Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail residential connections declined by 5.6%, compared with a loss of 6.8% at this time last year. Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next, on slide 11. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $99 million, or 2.6%. CPE sales, which we are deemphasizing, represented all of the decrease. Strategic services, which comprise 56% of global enterprise revenue, totaled $2.1 billion, up 6%. Continued declines in voice and data transport offsets this increase. In the enterprise market, we continue to work through economic challenges. We still see cautious behavior on the part of many enterprise customers in terms of new contracts and investment decisions. As we move through the year, we are hopeful that companies will be able to be more definitive about capital commitments and will renew their investing activities. Moving next to global wholesale, first quarter revenues declined $134 million, or 7.2%, due primarily to continued declines in transport services. Again, our strategy is to better monetize our global IP network by driving a more efficient migration to next generation Ethernet services. I would like to turn now to slide 12 to discuss our cash flow results. Our free cash flow in the first quarter was very strong. Cash flows from operations grew $1.6 billion, or 26.4%, and free cash flow increased to $3.9 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 billion, essentially flat year over year. We remain focused on improving investment returns and capital efficiency and we are expecting our capex to revenue ratio for the full year to decline.  In wireless, capital spending totaled $2 billion, up 5.7%. Within our overall spending outlook, we expect to allocate more capital to 4G LTE to further expand coverage and add capacity. With regard to capacity, we have started to incur some capital costs associated with the AWS spectrum, which we expect to deploy in our network later in the year.  In wireline, capital spending was $1.4 billion in the quarter, down 6.7%. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Our total debt at the end of the first quarter was $52.9 billion. Net debt was $47.4 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. Let\u2019s summarize on slide 13. As we stated earlier, we entered 2013 with great confidence. Our strategic investments and operational execution drove a solid financial start to the year. We expect to sustain this positive momentum throughout 2013 and into 2014. We are committed to driving shareholder value by executing our plans and improving the fundamentals of the business. Our focus is to capture incremental revenue growth in our key strategic areas. At the same time, we will continue to transform our service delivery and cost structures through the Verizon Lean Six Sigma initiative. As always, we will continue to invest in a disciplined manner, ensuring that we have the necessary platforms for innovation and growth. Through this strategy and execution model, we expect to drive cash flow and earnings growth. Before I turn the call back to Mike, I want to take a moment to say a word about the tragedy that has unfolded this week around the Boston Marathon. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. This is a very tough situation for so many people. We also want to thank our employees in the Boston area for their work and support of emergency personnel and law enforcement authorities. Verizon of course will continue to do whatever it can to help. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions.] Our first question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs:  First, on wireless, a very good margin results this quarter. I guess when we think about the prior guide you had given, 49-50% margins for the year, I think a lot of people sort of worry that we\u2019ll have good margins in the first three quarters of the year, only to give a lot of it back in the fourth quarter. I guess related to this, last week you announced the intention to lengthen the handset upgrade cycle to 24 months. A couple of questions. Was that contemplated in this guidance? And then just given the timing of that, which I think kicks in in September, do you think that sort of derisks the fourth quarter relative to historical experiencing? And the second question, I guess I\u2019ll take a crack at the Vodafone question. There\u2019s been obviously a lot more noise recently on the future of that relationship. And I\u2019m just wondering, is this the press and the analyst community really getting ahead of themselves? Or has there been some sort of change related to the partners\u2019 desire and urgency to find a resolution? \nFran Shammo : On the 49-50%, if you recall back to what I said in the first quarter, we said that we expected Verizon Wireless, for the full year, to be within the range of 49-50%. And obviously when I do something like that, I understand exactly what\u2019s on our plate of strategy for the year. And we had said before that we look at all of our policies and procedures on a normal basis, and this was one of those policies that we knew we were going to change.  And as you said, it\u2019s going to become effective September 1 and in essence what it does is it lessens our upgrade cycle from the -4 month from contract equal to the contract, so a full 24 months to be eligible for that upgrade. So I think that\u2019s all factored in with what I have said coming into this year, and that\u2019s why I was confident with the 49-50% on the full year basis.  And then with respect to Vodafone, obviously we made a public announcement on April 2 and I would reference all of you back to that announcement. Of course, as we\u2019ve always said before, we\u2019re very interested in acquiring the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless that we don\u2019t already own.  I will say, though, that there has been a lot of speculation about the tax consequences of a purchase of this 45%, and we are extremely confident that such a transaction could be accomplished in a manner that is very tax-efficient, and would not result in a tax on the gain in that stake. So beyond that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really much else to say. So at that, I\u2019ll pass it on to the next question. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: On the enterprise, just any impact or comments on sequestration? Is that having any material impact? Some of the comments you made about cautious spending. And then onto quad play. We\u2019ve seen both in Europe and also with some of the comments out of Dish this week around focusing on bundling wireless with video and with other wireline products. You talk a lot about your triple play. You have the cable JV. Can you just give us your broader thoughts on bundling wireless more closely with some of the FiOS and other products either now or down the road?\nFran Shammo : On the enterprise side of the house, we\u2019re seeing a lot of issues around enterprise. I think the sequestering has probably hit more of the government and state side of the house than it has the overall enterprise side of the house.  But on a much broader perspective around enterprise, obviously we believe that our platforms are there. We\u2019re having good growth in the areas of our cloud and our network strategies, our security is still growing at a good pace.  But obviously the voice and the data continue to offset this, and I don\u2019t really see a change there given the fact that we really have not seen a consistent and steady economic growth profile. We have not seen a consistent and steady employment rate. I still think there\u2019s some uncertainty out there around what\u2019s going to happen with tax reform.  So again, I believe that most companies are still in this cost cutting mode, really not investing but trying to get their P&L squared away. So until the overall macroeconomics change, I think we\u2019re going to be in this situation at least for the near term here. And then on the quad play, obviously we believe that the quad play is extremely important. That\u2019s why we entered into the cable agreement that we did a year ago with the cross-selling agreements and also with the joint innovation that we have agreed to do. Because I think that this is very important, because as we look at how do we innovate and bring content in and outside of the home on a seamless perspective, this is where that all comes into play. And I think Dish has just, again, supported what we knew a year ago, which was this strategy is the right strategy. The other thing I\u2019ll say is that with this, it also supports the fact that you have a foreign investor who wants to come into the North American wireless footprint. You have a domestic investor who wants to gain share in the wireless footprint. This again just confirms our overall belief that the wireless industry still has a lot of growth left in it, both on the quad play and with the innovation of machine-to-machine and 4G LTE. So I think that\u2019s where we sit with the quad play. \nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik - UBS: First, on the wireline side, the wholesale revenue decline improved nicely for the last couple of quarters. Is that really a function of the repositioning work you guys have done in VES? Or are there some other more macro trends driving that? And can we expect to see that improvement continue? And then over in wireless, it looks like, as I look at your prepaid and reseller numbers, it looks like prepaid was a little bit lighter than we thought, despite a price cut. And then you had stronger reseller numbers. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy in both of those categories and what we can expect going forward?\nFran Shammo : On the wholesale side of the house, I would tell you I believe that this is timing. And I think that if I had to predict what was going to happen the rest of the year, I think we\u2019re going to be around this 8-9% decline in wholesale. And it is mainly around, again, the drive behind volumes of voice and data.  And again, it points back to everything I talked about in enterprise, because most of the volume that we get on wholesale are people who resell that to enterprise customers and other customers for voice and data. So I agree with you. It has slowed a bit, but I think we\u2019re probably in a period of it\u2019s not going to improve here in the future. As far as prepaid goes, I guess a couple of things here. As I\u2019ve said before, in the prepaid market, we will look for niches to play that really complement what we want to be as a carrier in the prepaid market. And I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re not going to chase the low end on our retail side of the house, but we will look for niches where we can make impact.  And I guess I would say this is the eighth consecutive quarter of a net add positive on our prepaid in retail. As you said, we launched new pricing here in the first quarter. It was mid first quarter, so we don\u2019t really have the full impact of the quarter here on what we launched as smartphone pricing, which was the first time we\u2019d launched a smartphone pricing on prepaid. We also launched a $35 plan to really go after the basic phone category with a little bit of data in that.  So you\u2019re seeing us become, I wouldn\u2019t say over aggressive, but maybe a little bit more aggressive. But again, it ties into our network strategy of using the 3G network and keeping that network full, because it contributes a lot of margin. The other thing is, as I\u2019ve said in the past, we will always play in both arenas, between retail and wholesale, depending upon what drives the most value for Verizon shareholders.  And you saw this quarter, through a relationship that we have with one of our resellers, with the distribution agreement to Walmart, we added 1 million net subs on that side of the house, which was really all prepaid subs.  So, again, balancing out where we think the most favorable financial position is for us, to get the greatest return. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll see us going forward in the prepaid market.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open. \nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research:  First, if you could just give us an update on the ending balance for Verizon Wireless net debt? And then secondly, when we look at some of the numbers in the wireless business, it looks like the postpaid customer device replacement cycle is lengthening. And I was curious if you could talk about the reasons for that. Do you think it\u2019s because of the policy changes that you\u2019ve made over the last couple of years? Are you seeing any resistance from customers upgrading to the new shared plans that you\u2019ve laid out? Just curious for some of your thoughts on that subject.\nFran Shammo : Verizon Wireless debt gross is $10 billion, cash is $3.9 billion, for a net of $6.2 billion. On the device lineup, obviously if you look at what we have done over the last two years, what we plan to do coming here in the fourth quarter, if you look at the ecosystem of these devices, these are highly subsidized devices, and we have to make sure that we position the value to Verizon and the value to our customer on an equal basis.  So what you\u2019ve seen over the last two years in modifying the policies to make sure that we can still offer a great lineup of phones at a reasonable price to our consumers for a two-year service contract, you\u2019re seeing us lengthen that cycle.  And to be honest, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of resistance here. You have to understand that a lot of the upgrades were proactive by us, not by our customers. And so we\u2019re really just repositioning that the date of an upgrade is two years now instead of, say, 20 months.  We don\u2019t anticipate that there will be a lot of dissatisfaction here, but we have to watch this carefully. Obviously we want to give our customers the most choice that we possibly can. We think we have a great lineup. We have a lot of choices.  On the shared side of the house, we are not seeing resistance on people converting to shared. Actually, we\u2019re much ahead of what our expectations were. We have 30% of our base now on shared. And that continues to go up.  Also, within the shared plan, we\u2019re seeing exactly what we thought would happen. As people move to 4G, and you heard that 68% of our upgrades are to 4G, that\u2019s driving usage, which is also driving up the higher tiers, driving the revenue profile.  And also, the connected devices. As we said the last call, we see that when people come in as a new Verizon customer, their actual device attachment is much lower than our base, but over that 9 to 12 months, we see them attaching more devices and moving up to where the average of our overall base is.  So we continue to see that happening, and it\u2019s all about customer service as well, not just when an upgrade period is. So I think we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders here, but we have to watch this carefully. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura. Your line is open. \nMike McCormack - Nomura: Just wanted to circle back on the upgrade policy and your thoughts as the year progresses. There\u2019s been a view that we should have some of your competitors getting a little bit healthier towards the back half of the year. Does that set up to be another differentiator for those other carriers?  And then secondly, on the upgrade policy changes, is there a risk, as the customer matures past the 20 months, that the ETF is low enough that it could create unnecessary churn for you guys?  And then lastly, just thinking about data usage, and obviously it\u2019s an important thing for RPU revenue growth, how much of that, if you can measure it, is being offloaded onto the wifi network onto the wireline data side, to maybe either try to save data usage on the wireless side or to get a better customer experience? \nFran Shammo : On the upgrade policy, obviously these decisions from us are done based on a lot of customer input and customer feedback and focus groups. So we don\u2019t just jump into these things. You saw us do that when we implemented the $30 upgrade fee. So we\u2019re very diligent in how we do this. As far as customer contracts and ETFs, we\u2019ve managed this since we started with service agreements and 24 months.  So this is nothing new, and look, I think we compete on a number of fronts. It\u2019s not just on a service contract or pricing. We compete on our outstanding network. So when you look at our network and reliability, the 4G network and our superiority, I think if you compare our network with others that you have to say we\u2019re the leader in the market as far as reach, as far as consistency of performance. So when you go to connect that data session, it connects, you get the speed that we advertise on a consistent basis. You look at the Share Everything plan, and the options we have there and the flexibility within that plan. If you look at the number of our device lineups.  So all of this, including our great customer service from our customer service centers, this all goes into why our churn is the lowest in the industry, and will continue to be the lowest in the industry. And this is what we work for every single day. It\u2019s tackling the basics, as I said in my opening comments. So again, we manage all of this.  As far as data and offload to wifi, obviously customers offload to wifi, but what we see is, again, because of the superiority of our network, and because of the authentication that our network has, we actually want people to offload when they\u2019re in their homes, but when they\u2019re out in public areas, they want to stay on our network, because it is authenticated, it is secure, and a lot of wifi networks outside the home are not secure. So I think that plays into that as well. But we do think that wifi is a good offload in certain circumstances, but not all. \nMike McCormack - Nomura : Just quickly on cost of service and wireless, it had a meaningful step down, which obviously is a credit to your cost savings opportunities. How should we look at that progressing through the year?\nFran Shammo : Well, I think that all hinges on the upgrade, right? So when we came into this year, I said that our upgrades would be flat with a year ago. So it\u2019s obviously sequentially. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at. It is a considerable decrease, because of the volume that we had in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank:  You noted the importance of keeping a close eye on the level of subsidies that you incur, and that\u2019s why you made further adjustments to the upgrade policies. So if we look at the policies now, people have to keep their phone for the duration of their contract. They have an upgrade fee. It seems like you\u2019ve done just about everything you can do from a policy standpoint to keep subsidies in line.  Are there any other steps you can take as a carrier to work on that even further? For example, are you rethinking whether you should be favoring lower subsidized phones in the stores? Or is there even anything you can do to influence the actual cost of manufacturing a phone, so that it\u2019s lower for you? \nFran Shammo : So around this, again, I go back to, if you look at the history of basic phones and what happened over time, again I think the smartphone category will also follow this, where, as the competition and innovation, as new phones come to market - obviously Blackberry is coming back into the market, we have the Windows phone - so as more ecosystem comes here and more competition happens, the cost of these phones will eventually start to decrease.  And we\u2019ve already seen some of this competition happen in certain categories, with the decrease of smartphones. We\u2019ve launched smartphones in prepaid. That gives you an indication that there\u2019s some low end smartphones out there, because we really don\u2019t subsidize much on the prepaid product.  So again, as the ecosystem builds, I think this will follow what historically the basic phone did over the last 10 years that that was maturing. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to impact the lower subsidies over time. And of course then, as I\u2019ve said in the past, as we move into our 4G and our VoLTE launch, which we\u2019ll start to have VoLTE capable phones, we think, by the end of this year. We\u2019ll commercially launch early next year.  And as we do that, and our footprint of 4G LTE really covers that of the 3G network and the experiences there, then we\u2019ll start to take the CDMA chip out of those handsets. So again, that will impact subsidy going forward. So I think we have a good roadmap here that says our strategy, we believe that we can start to reduce subsidy over a length of two to three years. So I think that\u2019s what our position is. \nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank : And was there any experience that you had with feature phones where you found that you had the ability to push the ecosystem? In other words, do you think there\u2019s any opportunity to start driving customers towards smartphones that already have lower subsidies? Or do you really have to wait for the market to want those devices?\nFran Shammo : I think this goes back to customer satisfaction, and as I said before, we don\u2019t incent our front lines to sell one phone over another. This is a customer choice. Because again, the worst thing that can happen to us is force a phone into a customer\u2019s hands and within our return policy of 14 days worry free, they can come back and return that phone for dissatisfaction for any reason. And we give them a new phone. That is not a good financial model.  So we want the customer, when they walk out the door, to have the right phone in their hand, whatever phone they choose, and to make sure that they\u2019re educated to use that phone. So that\u2019s what\u2019s more important to us, instead of locking them into a low subsidy handset that they\u2019re going to be dissatisfied with. \nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank : And just a point of clarification, because you mentioned about eventually taking CDMA chips out of devices, what is the commitment to CDMA? And what would be the timeframe for getting there?\nFran Shammo : I think that\u2019s going to come into play in \u201914, so we\u2019ll keep you posted on that. But the strategy is to eventually, within these 4G LTE devices, to remove that chip at some point in time. So I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\nBrett Feldman - Deutsche Bank : So we see our first device, that doesn\u2019t necessarily have the CDMA chip, next year? Not all devices?\nFran Shammo : That\u2019s correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: \n, : And then I guess second, on the cash flow front, it looks like you guys didn\u2019t actually pay taxes this quarter, which was a big tailwind for that number. Can you give us a little bit more color about how you think that cash tax line is going to contribute or not to the cash flow picture for the rest of the year?\nFran Shammo : First, on the all categories growth, as I said in my prepared remarks, last year when we came into the first quarter I said that we would look at continuing to accelerate our growth through the year, and I think we\u2019re on plan to do that again this year.  As far as the mix of growth here, it\u2019s really evenly spread among all devices. So we had net gains in smartphone customers, we had net gains in our home phone connect product. We had net gains in fusion, tablets, internet devices, prepay. So it\u2019s across the gamut that we are driving on every single device. So it\u2019s not one device over another, but we think that we will continue to grow each individual category on a net positive basis.  As far as cash flow goes, there\u2019s all kinds of things that happen in cash taxes during the quarter. We pay a lot of property tax, a lot of sales tax. There is a federal estimated tax that\u2019s in the first quarter. So again, I think that\u2019s included in maybe some separate line items that you\u2019re not seeing. But we did make some cash tax payments in the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo: I just wanted to ask on spectrum, it was recently reported that the DOJ supports restricting the purchase of broadcast spectrum by limiting those current holders of low band spectrum such as yourself. There isn\u2019t a lot of spectrum, in my view, coming over the next two years. You\u2019re clearly in a good position with AWS, but how do you handle spectrum needs, and how will this impact your capex or small cell deployments going forward.\nFran Shammo : I think it\u2019s an important question, so let\u2019s just back up a second. So the FCC, right now, is targeting 2014 for the auctions, and is working to develop the rules around the auction process. Obviously we\u2019re working very closely with the FCC and the broadcasters and others in the industry to develop the rules around these auctions and make them successful.  Really our basis is we want to ensure that the FCC develops and implements the auctions in a way that allows Verizon Wireless to bid for and acquire the additional spectrum that it needs to run its business.  As you know, the FCC, they need to maximize the amount of spectrum available for mobile broadband services and ensure the auction is designed to encourage the broadcasters themselves to participate. These rules that restrict companies from bidding and give other companies priority could actually cause the auction to fail.  So as you know, the DOJ recently this week weighed in on a theoretical concern about the market foreclosure. We believe the concern is really around some who buy the spectrum to keep others from buying the spectrum, and I think if you look at history, that has not shown itself. Verizon has never purchased spectrum for that reason. We buy it to use it, and I think our track record is we really efficiently use the spectrum that we have.  And I think the secondary market is another important one here, because we\u2019ve proved that the secondary market worked in 2012 by divesting some of the spectrum that we felt others could use more appropriately than we could. So I think this all goes into that, but I think that\u2019s our view around the DOJ, and we will work closely with the FCC in order to make that spectrum available for the people who need it. So as far as capex and utilizing what we need, obviously we\u2019re in a very good position with spectrum, and as I said before, when spectrum comes up, whether it\u2019s in an auction or for sale on the open market, you have to be opportunistic, because it normally only comes up at one time, and we\u2019re very selective on what we go after. But we have a very long term strategy with spectrum, and we\u2019ll be opportunistic if the climate presents itself.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Seitz of Jefferies. Your line is open. \nTom Seitz - Jefferies: A couple of question related to the copper fiber migration. First, it looks like you\u2019re a little bit ahead of plan. Is that just a function of fixing Sandy issues immediately or do you think you can keep or even accelerate this pace? Second, you disclosed I think 83,000 forced conversions. Can you give us some idea of how many took just the voice product versus how many stepped up? \nFran Shammo : Just a couple of things here. Around the copper to fiber migration, obviously with this one we did have very, very good process this quarter in converting these migrations. And some of this obviously had to do with some of the Sandy impact. I would also tell you, though, that this is really a technology change, and we need to really move to the new technologies.  From a regulatory standpoint, if you look at it, the FCC has longstanding rules in place that permit copper retirement. Now, I know some of the CLECs have urged the FCC to suspend or change these rules, but we need to encourage our customers and others to move to the new technologies in order to provide our customers with the best solutions that they have.  And for many of our customers, that service is best delivered over fiber or even maybe a wireless network. And in some of these situations, we\u2019re not going to rebuild the copper. It doesn\u2019t make financial sense to lay fiber to some of these remote areas. So wireless may be a better solution here, and we\u2019re working with the regulatory agencies on that.  And within Pennsylvania, a year ago, we solved some of the internet provisioning via LTE, instead of fiber. So I think the regulatory bodies are very open to it. We continue to work with them.  But as far as the copper to fiber migration for the first quarter, I think we\u2019re off to a great start, and 300,000 is our target. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t exceed that, but we will continue to migrate our customers to the new technology.  As far as the breakdown between voice and internet, we really don\u2019t despair there, because what\u2019s happening is as we move people over to fiber, they\u2019re coming onto the Quantum product. 27% of our base now is on Quantum, and what we\u2019re seeing is they\u2019re buying up in the tiers, because once they get that 15-30 MB tier, and that\u2019s what\u2019s helping to drive the stellar revenue performance in the consumer market of 4.3%, which is the highest I think we\u2019ve ever had at this point, compared to some of the prior years, and consistent with what we performed in last year.  So I think we\u2019re on a good path here to continue to produce solid wireline consumer revenue growth with our strategy that we laid out. \nOperator: Our last question for today comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTim Horan - Oppenheimer: Around wireless, I had a few questions. As part of moving to the 24-month cycle, I would assume there\u2019s a lot of variables to go with that, but it would seem to me that the shared data plans are helping that a lot. And maybe can you talk a little bit about the data usage on those shared data plans, and the growth rate, or any other metrics you can provide? And then also, on the phones, it just seems like the phones are getting a lot better. I know in my own family we used to break the phones after 12 months, and now they seem to be lasting a lot longer. Was that part of the thinking?  And just related to that, both personally and professionally, are you flexible at all in the 24-month upgrades? Will you provide 20-month upgrades for high quality customers who are getting maybe a lower subsidy phone? How rigid is that? \nFran Shammo : On the 24-month cycle, obviously our policies are our policies, and obviously I\u2019ll let Verizon Wireless deal with any exceptions to those policies at the front line, because again, we want to make sure the customers are satisfied. But the policy is the policy, and we want to make sure that the front line sticks to our policies. But obviously, again, as you know, there\u2019s always an exception to the rule here and there. As far as really thinking this through, I think these are highly subsidized phones. These are miniature computers walking around. It really goes to, when you look at the demographics of the customers who upgrade, demographics play a big role in this. I mean, the younger generation wants to update to the day. Some others will hold their phones for three, even four years. So it really is a vast difference, and we\u2019re just trying to conform everything to a consistent policy, so that it makes sense for the customer and it makes sense for us. As far as 4G LTE and data usage, as we\u2019ve said, 54% of our data now is going over the LTE network, so that should tell you something about the usage of our 4G LTE customers. Beyond that, we\u2019re not going to disclose any individual statistics around data usage. \nMichael Stefanski: I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and operator, we can conclude the call."}], "2015": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2014, "date": "2015-01-22 11:07:03", "content": "Executives: Michael Stefanski - SVP, Investor Relations Fran Shammo \u2013 EVP and Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts: Phil Cusick - JPMorgan Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch John Hodulik - UBS Mike Rollins - Citi Investment Research Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Mike McCormack - Jefferies Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo\nOperator: Good morning. And welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, David. Good morning. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. Before Fran goes through our performance results, I like to cover our earnings reconciliation for the fourth quarter and highlight a few special items. These are displayed on slide three. For the fourth quarter we reported a loss of $0.54 per share on a GAAP basis. This reported result includes several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight. The largest item is our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This year we recorded a pretax expense of $7 billion to increase our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment which was primarily non-cash was caused by changes in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions. We also incurred pretax expenses of $502 million related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these two charges amounted to $4.7 billion or $1.12 per share. We also incurred non-operational expenses of $872 million in connection with early debt redemption and other costs. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $528 million or $0.13 per share. Details regarding the income statement line item effects for these items are available on our website in the Financial and Operating Information and Non-GAAP Reconciliation schedules. Excluding the non-operational charges of $1.25 per share, adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the fourth quarter. This compares with adjusted EPS of $0.66 a year ago, an increase of 7.6%. For the full year adjusted earnings per share was $3.35, compared with $2.84 in 2013, an increase of 18%. Keep in mind that the $3.35 adjusted EPS does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of 2014 since the transaction closed on February 21st. The results and growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and remarks exclude the effects of the non-operational items and are therefore on an adjusted basis. Also the growth rates we provide on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. I would like to remind everyone that due to the FCC's rules, we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. When the rules permit, we do plan to provide you with an update on our participation. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and happy New Year. 2014 was a great year of execution and achievement for Verizon from both a strategic and financial perspective. We delivered strong operating and financial performance and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in any environment. Strategically, our most notable accomplishment was completing the transaction for full ownership of Verizon Wireless. We closed the deal in late February, providing immediate earnings accretion and full access to the cash flows of what we believe is the best Wireless asset in the world. Throughout the year, we continued our steady and consistent investment in our networks and platforms, which are critical to driving profitable growth in the future. Our strong cash generation enabled us to invest $17.2 billion of capital and returned value to shareholders through dividend payments, which totaled $7.8 billion for the year. Last September, our Board of Directors approved 3.8% dividend increase, raising the annual amount to $2.20 per share. At the same time, we are investing and innovating for the future through new growth businesses and integrated product development efforts in rapidly evolving markets like mobile video and the Internet of Things. The foundation of our continued success is network excellence, which is the hallmark of the Verizon brand. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services, which will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our networks provide the fundamental strength and basis for our competitive advantage. Our industry is strong and demand is growing with customers using Wireless and Broadband even more and in different ways than ever before. Our competitive position is very strong and we are well-positioned from a strategic standpoint to capitalize on these market trends. In Wireless, we had another exceptional year of quality connections, growth and profitability. Retail postpaid net adds totaled 5.5 million for the year, with 2 million coming in a highly competitive fourth quarter that featured heavy promotional activity. Postpaid activations, gross additions, upgrades and net adds all grew by double-digit percentages in 2014. Total operating revenues grew 8.2% for the year and our EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, even with the short-term pressure of significant device volumes in the fourth quarter. In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 5% for the year driven by our FiOS platform. In 2014, we continue to increase penetration in existing markets and ended the year at 41% for Internet and just under 36% for video. Our sharp focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in an 80-basis point expansion of our EBITDA margin to 23.2% for the full year. Now let's get into the fourth quarter and full-year performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on slide five. On a reported basis, total operating revenue grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we added $6.5 billion to our topline, representing 5.4% growth, which exceeded our guidance of 4% consolidated revenue growth for 2014. If we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rates would have been 7.3% for the fourth quarter and 5.7% for the full year. Our data revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. In the fourth quarter, growth was favorably impacted by increased Wireless equipment revenue due to the significant 4G device activations. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics are beginning to emerge. In 2014, these revenues totaled about $585 million, with growth of more than 45%. There are countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things ecosystem across multiple industries. A great example of this was unveiled last week at the North American International Auto Show, where we announced Verizon Vehicle, a powerful new connected-vehicle service. This unique aftermarket solution modernizes traditional roadside assistance while enhancing driver safety and convenience. We expect this service to launch commercially in the second quarter. The addressable market is more than 200 million vehicles on the road today that are not connected to the Internet, or have a GPS unit. We believe that this large unserved market stands to greatly benefit from this new car Wireless connectivity solution. In addition to topline growth, we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $43.3 billion in 2014, an increase of 2.9%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 34.1%. Let's take a look at our cash flow results on slide 6. As I previously noted, the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless created a lack of comparability between the current and prior periods in our statement of cash flows. In 2014, cash flows from operations totaled $30.6 billion. In addition to incremental cash interest and tax payments, we made $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not have to fund in 2013. In spite of these additional cash outlays and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $13.4 billion for the year. Our capital program was consistent with our guidance of around $17 billion for the year with improving capital efficiency. In total, capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.2 billion for the full year, up 3.5% from 2013. Our annual CapEx to revenue ratio was 13.5%, an improvement from 13.8% in 2013. The pace of capital spending in Wireless was very consistent throughout all four quarters of the year. Wireless CapEx was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the full year. We continue to invest the necessary capital to proactively stay ahead of demand. Our investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology in building solutions and distributed antenna systems. As I am sure you\u2019ve seen from our advertising, we now have deployed AWS or XLTE, as we have branded it in more than 400 markets, effectively doubling our existing capacity. And despite what others claim about certain aspects of their networks, when you look across the entire nation and consider all the relevant performance metrics, Verizon has the nation's largest and most reliable 4G LTE network. We are consistently acknowledged as the performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. In Wireline, capital spending totaled $1.6 billion in the quarter and $5.8 billion for the year, down 7.7% from 2013. Our balance sheet remained strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the year with $113.3 billion of gross debt and $102.7 billion of net debt. We significantly improved the maturity profile of our debt portfolio during 2014 through various debt market transactions. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.4 times. We remain committed to getting back to our pre-transaction credit rating profile into 2018 to 2019 timeframe. Now let's move into review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide 7. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. Our investment strategy is focused on adding network capacity ahead of accelerating demand, which is driven by increasing 4G device adoption and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. In 2014, we strengthened the overall quality of our customer accounts. We added 24.7 million 4G devices into our postpaid connection space, representing annual growth of about 58%. In addition, we increased the number of More Everything shared data plans to 61% of total accounts. The average connections per account grew 4% in ARPA plus Edge installment billings increased by more than 5% in 2014. As I stated coming out of the third quarter, we expected and closed the year with the very high volume quarter. Total postpaid device activations in the fourth quarter were unprecedented, totaling 15.3 million, up nearly 34% over last year. More than 13 million were phones, driven by iconic smartphone launches from both Apple and Samsung. To give some historical perspective, these phone activations were 1.5 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, which at that time was a record high because it was the first time of 4G iPhone or our free 3G iPhone was available on our network. The usage characteristics of these iconic 4G smartphones also generate strong returns and higher NPV. Our fourth quarter promotions were successful, driving a sequential and year-over-year increase in gross adds, net adds, and upgrades. This customer growth sets us up very well for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond, as we drive usage and leverage the efficiencies of our LTE network. Total Wireless operating revenues were $23.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11%. For the full year operating revenues totaled $87.6 billion, representing growth of $6.6 billion or 8.2%. Total service revenues grew 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year. Verizon Edge installment billings totaled $443 million in the quarter and $976 million for the full year. Service revenues plus Edge installment billings grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 6.6% for the full year. As we expected, the percentage of phone activations on the Edge program increased to about 25% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with slightly more than 7 million phones on Edge, which is just over 8% of our postpaid phone base. In terms of profitability, we generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and $35.2 billion for the full year, an increase of more than $1 billion or 3%. Our EBITDA service margin for the fourth quarter was 42%, due to the significant device volumes. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin was 48.5% compared with 49.5% in 2013. The full year EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 40.2%, compared with 42.2% for 2013. Now let's turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide eight. Retail postpaid service revenue per account, or ARPA, grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. If you add the Edge installment billings to ARPA, the growth rates increased to 3.5% for the quarter and 5.3% for the full year. We ended the year with 35.6 million postpaid accounts, an increase of 1.5%. The number of postpaid connections per account grew to 2.87, up 4% from a year ago. As I said, the number of customers\u2019 accounts on More Everything shared data plans increased from 46% to 61% of total. As you would expect, the average number of connections in More Everything plans are higher at 3.06 per account and grew faster, up more than 7%. And the average data usage in these accounts has increased by about 50% in the past year. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide nine. We ended the year with 108.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections space grew 5.5% to 102.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million. As we said, 2014 was a year of historical connections growth. Postpaid gross additions were 5.4 million in the quarter, up 25.5%. For the year, postpaid gross adds totaled 17.8 million, up 18% from 2013 and 20% higher than 2012. In terms of the gross add mix in the quarter, 55% were smartphones and about 37% were Internet devices, primarily tablets, about 6% were basic phones. This percentage mix is also representative of the full year. As we said in our updates, we did experience an alleviative rate of retail postpaid churn in the fourth quarter at 1.14%. Throughout the year, we maintained a disciplined approach to customer acquisition and retention with the focus on attracting and retaining high quality customers. Within a heightened amount of phone activity in the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the overall improvement in the quality of our phone base. Our retail postpaid net additions of 2 million in the fourth quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Our 5.5 million postpaid net additions for the year compare favorably with the 4.1 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012. As far as the postpaid net add mix, the fourth quarter including 1.5 million new 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablet. Postpaid phone net adds totaled 672,000, as the 1.5 million 4G smartphones were offset in part by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. Full year net adds of 5.5 million included 4.6 million 4G smartphones and 4.3 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet internet devices. Let\u2019s now turn to slide 10 and take a look at device activations and our success in driving 4G adoption and usage. Total postpaid device activations totaled 15.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 34%. For the full year, postpaid activations totaled 48.1 million, up 16% from 2013, about 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablet. 4G LTE devices now comprise 66% of our retail postpaid connection space. This strong device adoption continues to drive increased usage. We ended the year with 67.7 million smartphones in total, about 80% of which were 4G. Smartphone penetration increased to 79% of total phones, about 75% of our phone activations in the quarter were customer upgrades. In total about 9.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter. As you would expect, a vast majority of these upgrades were 4G smartphones. Most of our smartphone upgrades represent an incremental revenue opportunity for us. 1.2 million were upgrades from basic phones, about 46% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G, which we monetized through higher data usage and a lower cost to serve. We also continue to successfully identify and retain a high percentage of what we call high-risk high-value accounts. Looking ahead, we still have a sizable quality upgrade opportunity, with about 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones remaining in our postpaid connections base. We are very focused on this opportunity to upgrade customers and protect our high-quality postpaid base. In addition, we also have a profitable growth opportunity with further penetration of tablets. We ended the year with about 8 million postpaid tablets in our connections base. Tablets have expanded the market for postpaid devices and provide us a good value through increase data consumption and lower churn at the account level. Data and video usage on our network continues to rise, about 84% of our total data traffic was on the 4G LTE network. We are handling this demand and by our own measures the network performance continues to improve. Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 11. In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In fact, we have posted 10 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in excess of 4%/. In the fourth quarter, Consumer revenues grew 4.1% and for the full year were up 5%, exceeding our guidance of at least 4% growth. Mass markets which includes small business, grew 3% in the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. FiOS now represents 77% of Consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, FiOS Consumer revenue grew 11.1%, driven by a combination of customer growth, pricing actions and increase FiOS quantum penetration. At the end of the year, 59% of our FiOS internet customers subscribe to data speed higher than 50 megabits per second. This is up from 46% at the end of 2013. Throughout the year, we continue to improve the customer value proposition, driving better investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. During 2014, we introduced FiOS Quantum TV. Another differentiated offer was our Speed Match service, which increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds. In December, we introduced the FiOS Quantum Gateway, our new router that delivers America's fastest Wi-Fi. You will begin to see more marketing of this router and its capability shortly. Looking ahead, our focus will remain on driving higher penetration in the existing markets, which in turn will generate profitable growth and further improve our investment returns. In Broadband, we added 145,000 net FiOS customers in the quarter and 544,000 for the year. We have a total of 6.6 million FiOS Internet subscribers representing 41.1% penetration, which is up 160 basis points for the year. Overall, net Broadband subscribers increased 59,000 in the quarter and 190,000 for the full year. In FiOS video, we added 116,000 net customers in the quarter and 387,000 for the year. We have a total of 5.6 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.8% penetration, an increase of 80 basis points in 2014. In terms of our network evolution initiative, we converted an additional 52,000 Copper customers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to around 255,000. In total, we have converted more than 800,000 customers to fiber since we started this initiative in 2011. Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services, which result in additional recurring revenue. In 2015, we plan to convert another 200,000 Copper customers to fiber. During 2014, we also continued our consolidation efforts around central offices, which will recreate additional efficiencies. We have a strong commitment to customer service, and have implemented several new frontline tools that are improving efficiency and increasing customer satisfaction. While we benchmark well against the competition, we have more work to do in 2015 to take our performance to the next level. Let's turn to slide 12 and cover enterprise and the wholesale business. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 4.6%, which included about $30 million of pressure from FX. For the full year, revenue of $13.7 billion was down 3.5%. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Strategic services grew 1.5% in the quarter and 2.3% for the year. This category includes both of IP layer and application such as data center, cloud, security and managed and professional services. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in application services. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.8% in the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. On the positive side, healthy demand for Ethernet services continues but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment were down 1.6% in the quarter and 0.5% for the full year. In terms of profitability, EBITDA increased 4.3% in the quarter and 3% for the full year. The EBITDA margin was 23.9% in the quarter and 23.2% for the year, up 80 basis points from 2013. While we are making steady progress in the Wireline business and achieved our goal of expanding margins, we are far from satisfied. There is more work to do to drive sustainable improvements in both revenue growth and profitability. Our path to improve profitable growth includes driving further FiOS penetration and improving operating and capital efficiency. In the enterprise and the wholesale business, we are changing our revenue mix toward newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services. On the cost side of the equation, we have realized many noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. We are confident that this continued focus will improve our overall cost structure, ultimately resulting in a much stronger Wireline business. Let's move next to our summary slide. Our operating and financial performance in 2014 demonstrated once again that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. 2014 was a remarkable year from a financial viewpoint. We delivered 18% growth in adjusted earnings per share with very strong cash flows. We executed a strategically important $130 billion transaction through a combination of debt and equity. Our strong cash generation allowed us to invest $17.2 billion in capital, pay $7.8 billion in dividends, make incremental cash interest in tax payments and redeem higher coupon notes in the course of restructuring our debt maturity schedule. In addition, we declared a 3.8% dividend increase and improved our cash position since the closing of the Vodafone transaction. Our customer growth in the fourth quarter, particularly in Wireless gives us a great confidence heading into 2015. In terms of our 2015 outlook, it is difficult to predict the competitive intensity with others, particularly in Wireless. However, we have faced highly competitive Wireless environments before and I have always been able to successfully and profitably grow the business, because our customers understand the value of our services. In this environment, we will continue to protect our base by focusing on net adds and upgrades that make financial sense for our business. We will also continue to focus on growing in the right customer segments, while at the same time creating new revenue streams for the future. Over a sustained period of time, our industry is governed by free cash flow dynamic. To be successful, companies need to generate free cash flow, which can be invested in their networks to attract and retain customers by providing a quality experience. In that context, we are targeting the following for 2015, consolidated revenue growth of at least 4%, sustain profitability with a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin at a level consistent with our full year 2014 performance, strong free cash flow generation with consolidated capital spending of between $17.5 billion and $18 billion, and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $700 million. In terms of income taxes, we realized the cash benefit in 2014 due to the extension of bonus depreciation, which will also have a carryover benefit in 2015. However, with the full year of 100% Wireless net income, we expect total cash income taxes to increase in 2015. We also expect our effective tax rate for book purposes to be in the area of 34% to 36%. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you, Fran. David, we are now ready to take the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, I guess to start speaking of free cash flow needs in the Wireless industry, can you help us range your 2015 free cash flow given the commentary on higher cash pension expense, EIP and CapEx?\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Phil. I\u2019m not going to get into the specific guidance on free cash flow, but you can see what we generated this year. I\u2019ve guided you to a consistent EBITDA margin on a growth rate of revenue of at least 4%, and I want to stress that at least 4%. The other thing is, I think that cash taxes at this point given where we are, if we don't give bonus extension from '15 into '16 that obviously that puts more pressure in '16 on cash taxes as well. So I'm not going to get into specific guidance on that metric, but I think I've given enough to put us in the ballpark.\nPhil Cusick: Maybe I can try again. Given the revenue growth, can you talk about your assumptions on the Edge mix in 2015, so how much of that revenue growth should we think about is coming from equipment revenue that\u2019s more recognized than cash? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Yeah. So I think on the revenue growth side of at least 4%, if you think about that metric. What we are planning for right now is that our Edge take rate probably increases to around 34%, 35% take rate, so some of that will be equipment revenue. But I think what you have to focus in on is if you look at the service revenue component, you look at the recurring revenue of FiOS. So if you look at the recurring revenues of this business, 4% plus is an achievable metric, but obviously equipment revenue will play a factor in that. But keep in mind as we start to -- start to go out into the future on the installment sales, the installment sales really neutralized themselves over two-year period of time if you think of it that way. So as we collect more on installment sales, we are putting more on, but cash flow is starting to catch up with it. So I would keep that all in mind. The other thing too is from a cash flow perspective, we are looking at alternatives around the receivable as this grows. So you could see us do things around securitization in the future, not that that we are announcing anything today. But that is a possibility that we\u2019re looking at as we continue to grow that mix on the Edge program.\nPhil Cusick: That helps. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David, we can take the next question now?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Fran, you talked in your summary comments about your focus on non-strategic assets sales. There has been a lot of talk for about towers for a while, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. Can you just talk about towers and then access lines, datacenters, enterprise, how you are thinking about some other -- some of these assets and what we should expect going forward? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Look, I think, we\u2019ve talked about a lot of this in the past. But at this point, we are aware of all the rumors in the marketplace. Naturally we don't have any comment on any specific rumors, but we have consistently said that we are always looking at all kinds of strategic transactions and if they are the right transactions and provide value to our shareholders, we will execute on those transactions and at that time, we will come back to you and announce our strategy around that. But beyond that there's really nothing else to say on this subject.\nSimon Flannery: So, just to say, are you -- you expect to make some transactions this year or is it just dependent on the terms?\nFran Shammo: I think, what I would say is, we continue to look at all strategic availability and if something makes sense then we will execute on that strategic initiative.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: David, we can take the next question now?\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Fran, just on your comments about free cash flow kind of governing the competitive intensity in the space, could you talk about the assumptions that you're making for your 2015 expectations? Are you assuming that competition kind of continues at its current course and speed? Does it level out at kind of current levels or are you assuming that maybe it even reverses course, it would be kind of helpful to get a sense of the backdrop you're making assumptions on? And then second, just kind of whilst in the headlines, could you opine a little bit on what you think the import of Google kind of doing an MVNO in this space, is did you have a chance to talk to them about what their plans are, as they kind of where going in the market looking to try to execute on something? It would be helpful to get some color on that? Great. Thanks.\nFran Shammo: All right. So look, I think, it\u2019s important just to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014 around price competition and the intensity of the competition, and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time. So we had topline growth of 5.7%, we expanded the EBITDA by $1 billion in Wireless, we expanded the EBITDA in Wireline of $200 million, we had net [phone] [ph] adds which seemed to be the big issue of 1.3 million in this competitive environment and we grow our overall net adds year-over-year by 24%. So I think the basic point here is, is that we will continue to compete and we will continue to compete at a positive profitable value. I talk -- also it's important as we enter into 2015, with the competition we are also doing a lot of different things. So number one, based on our base, as I said in my comments, we saw 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones that we will pursue to upgrade into our 4G LTE network that is more efficient, generates more revenue. Tablets are only 8% of our base and as I said in the past, tablets will continue to be a very large piece of our growth into the future. Tablets are very, very good because, one, they make it more sticky at the account level; two, we get a recurring revenue stream albeit lower than a smartphone but the subsidy on that is much reduced. And then also, it also increases the amount of usage and video uptake on the network, which is what we\u2019re driving to is the more usage to benefit on the bundles. The other thing is, as you look out to us and directions we\u2019re taking, obviously as we stated Internet of Things is going to be a very important category, 585 million up 45% year-over-year. And we don't really disclose it but we have over 15 million connections now of Internet of Things. We announced the Verizon vehicle as I said, you should look at us as launching over-the-top MobileFirst sometime this as Lowell has talked about in the past. And on the Wireline side, we just launched a new router which we think is going to improve both the intake of video into the home. But it's also very important because it has to sustain the ability of Wireless products within that home. And as you know, when you get four to five devices running on that router today that, that can only deliver up to 75 megabits, you're really not getting 75 megabits. So this router will be able to produce significant higher throughput and we believe it\u2019s the fastest in the industry today. So putting that all in context from a competitive standpoint and what we can deliver, the guidance we're giving you is based on all the strategic action that we will be taking in the future. The other two things I would talk about is if you look at our prepaid base, again another positive quarter, up 7.5% on ARPU growth and then of course our own reseller base with our own strategic initiatives with that whether you call it a reseller base or MVNO is all positive and growing positively. So that leads me into the Google discussion. I guess what I would say right off the bat, number one, is this is not just another very prime example of the intensity in the competition around this industry. The availability of the open networks and access to the networks and this is why another reason why this industry does not need to be regulated. I would also say on this one is, if you look at Google, they've entered the fiber, they\u2019ve done other initiatives. Their whole purpose is to increase speeds so that people can do more search. What I would say is we\u2019ll have to wait to see how they execute on the MVNO but listen MVNOs or resellers or people leasing the network from carriers has been around for 15 years. It's a complex issue. You have to deal directly with the consumer. There is a whole infrastructure that's needed to do that. So I think this is another example of where Google is going to enter the market under a platform basis to do what they want to do. And it's just another competitor as we look at it. So I'll leave it at that.\nDavid Barden: Thanks a lot, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David, we can take the next question now please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks. Good morning guys. As you look at the results of the Wireless quarter churn and the upgrade rate really for standout as having spiked. And obviously, there is couple of drivers, I think the competition and the number of iPhones you guys are renewing this quarter. So is there a way, Fran, to sort of delineate the two and as you look out to 2015, are these -- do you expect these numbers to remain elevated because of competition or should we expect them to both, trend back towards a more normalized level? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Yeah, thanks John. So I think this is what we need to look at, as we said in the remarks and follow the words carefully is that we will pursue our base. We will pursue net adds and we will pursue upgrades that are financially beneficial to the company. So what that means is at a 1.14% churn rate, you should take that as we did not go to places where we do not financially want to go to save a customer. And there's going to be certain customers who leave us for price and we're just not going to compete with that because it doesn\u2019t make financial sense for us to do that. As far as why upgrades were so high, I think you have to go back a little bit and reflect on what we did in the past. So if you look at 2013, we made a lot of policy changes around upgrades. It pushed the upgrade view back into \u201814. So in \u201814, we took probably more upgrades than we generally would have taken because of those policy changes. But as we came out of the third quarter, I said that we had about 3.2 million iPhones in our base that were coming out of contract. And that was the signal that we were going to aggressively go after those 3.2 million customers and we did. We are very satisfied with the quality of the upgrades. So if you look at it from that perspective in the remarks I made, look at it on a percentage basis. 78% of our upgrades are what we would call strategic quality upgrades and that means a 3G to 4G, or basic to 4G, or a high value type customer who delivers a lot of value to us and we appreciate their business and we want to keep them as a customer. So that\u2019s how you should view this, John and I think that with the competition and some of the pricing that\u2019s out there, you should think that we are going to have a higher churn rate because some customers we are just going to financially keep.\nJohn Hodulik: Sounds good. Thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Rollins: Thanks for taking the question. Just two. First, if you look at the margin guidance that you are providing on a consolidated level and the aspirations to improve the Wireline margins, does that mean that Wireless margins are facing some headwinds just as you are processing the higher volume environment coming off the fourth quarter and some of your initiatives that you are planning for 2015? And then secondly, Fran, if you can give us an update on your video strategy with any more details or perspectives you could share with us on what that product might look like later in the year when you talked about launching it? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks Michael. So on the competitive consolidated margin, look I think it's important again that you focus on the words. We said at least topline 4% growth. We said that we would have at least a consolidated margin consistent with 2014, but I think you need to put it in perspective that we had an extremely heavy fourth quarter in 2014. So, I would not expect that to repeat in 2015, given the iconic devices that hit and given the level of competition at this point in time versus what we would expect next year. I think the other important thing too is, as you are focusing in on this, I think it's important to focus on 2014 earnings per share, so we grew at 18%. I know most of you will subtract out the 10% for the accretion of Vodafone. So when you look at it, the core business in this highly competitive environment grew at 8%. I would also say that don\u2019t get ahead of yourselves on the Wireline accretion of margin as Lowell and I said before, this will be a slow progression of Wireline accretion. So we grew 80 basis points this year. We will continue to focus in on topline growth and continue to take out those costs, continue our copper to fiber migration efforts and continue to become more efficient of the company. So, I wouldn't read too much into. We expect Wireline to jump off the charts and Wireless to go down. On the over-the-top strategy, I guess I'm not going to disclose as to too much what we are going to do. But I think if you look at the environment, there is a lot of positive things coming out of the environment. So if you look at what Dish has done around some of their recent launches, look at CBS and their own launch of over-the-top with their own programming. This just leads us to a path of content owners are willing to open up their content to different models and that's exactly what we are going to execute on it. And we are working with many content providers to join that model and we will have a lot more to say about that and Marni and I obviously, Lowell will talk more about that when we launch our first product come this summer.\nMike Rollins: Thanks very much.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And I\u2019m going to follow up a little bit on what Mike said and Fran in your response. Typically when we see telecom operators start ramping content driven models, there is a big upfront investment particularly in content costs. So just wonder if you can maybe just help us think, are we going to begin to see any of that spending flow through your P&L this year and is that a component of how you thought about your margin guidance you provided? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Well, number one, on the traditional model of FiOS, obviously in our guidance we've included an increase in content cost because every year you have a content cost and you should feature in around, consistent with where we were in 2014 around a 3% to 4% content increase cost right now is what we are projecting. As far as the new model, again, I'm not going to get a lot into that model. You should not think about it as a traditional linear TV model. It's going to be, I would think a different type of a model. So, we'll wait till midsummer when we can talk more about that. But within our plan, we do have those content costs.\nBrett Feldman: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike McCormack: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, Fran, following on, I guess, somewhat related to the Wireless margin story in 2015. But just trying to get a sense for what your thoughts are on ARPA sort of puts and takes? Obviously, you\u2019re talking about some potential, I guess, save retention tools on your base, the competitive landscape. Do we still think you can get some modest growth on ARPA in '15? And then secondly, the CapEx level, I think, is a bit above what prior commentary had been, not dramatically, but trying to get a sense for what that is, whether it\u2019s Wireline, Wireless? I know you and I had spoken about densification back in December, I am assuming it\u2019s probably related to that. Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Mike. So, on the VZW margin, the follow-up question on around the ARPA, I think this becomes a more tricky question, because obviously ARPA is around service. And with the Edge program, we are kind of convoluting that now, that it\u2019s a tougher metric to get your hands around, which is why we are giving out the recurring installment billings to try to get it on an apples-to-apples comparison. But if you think about that, we grew that ARPA by 5.2%. So look, I think, given everything that\u2019s going on, and given that the fact that I said we would have a topline growth of 4%, obviously we believe that we can continue to accrete the ARPA of this business, given everything I said about the additional growth things that we\u2019re keen in on, just the jump off point that we came into this year. So the other thing too is if you go back to 2012, the fourth quarter of '12 was very much like this quarter of '14. We really placed the bet on growth and upgrades and solidifying our base. In '12, albeit we added lot more smartphone net adds back then, but it\u2019s pretty much the same quarter that gives us a great basis to jump off into 2015. So that\u2019s how I would think about the ARPA as a metric. On CapEx, Mike, it goes directly to what you said. I have been pretty consistent with this in the fact that we will spend more CapEx in the Wireless side and we will continue to curtail CapEx on the Wireline side. And some of that\u2019s, because we are getting to the end of our committed build around FiOS. Penetration is getting higher. We are reconnecting homes that we\u2019ve already connected. So it\u2019s not additional capital that we have to outlay and we are very focused on those, what we call connected homes that are not our customers to go aback after them that that is a very good return for us, because we\u2019ve already spent the capital to connect that home. So it\u2019s a lot of combination around that. But yes, this is around densification, this is around our projection of growth for the Wireless industry and staying ahead of that. So again, it\u2019s all about encompassing. So we are looking at a slight increase from where we ended 2014.\nMike McCormack: And Fran, just thinking about the densification, are there particular markets where you guys are spending more? Are there pressure points that you look at in '15 is being areas where you would need to sort of not rush and go out and spend, but I guess there is a focus?\nFran Shammo: Not really. I mean, it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we did in '14. I mean, obviously, your major cities are where you have your biggest densification happening right now. Because as we launch AWS around the U.S. and get the coverage map up, AWS is really handling most of that outside of the major cities, but it\u2019s the major cities that are being densified on a quicker basis.\nMike McCormack: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.\nMichael Stefanski: David, let\u2019s take the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much. And good morning, folks. Fran, it does seem as one of the standouts for you folks has been the ability to reduce costs through operational efficiency. And I know you touched upon this with some of your questions in your prepared remarks. But is there any sense that you can give us sort of the scope of opportunities over a multiyear period? I guess the genesis of the question is really we find ourselves in an intensely competitive environment as you had mentioned. How much opportunity is there for you folks to continue to drive down costs in order to retain this sort of industry leading margin profile on cash generation ability that you guys have built over for the last couple of years?\nFran Shammo: Just a couple of thoughts around that. Number one is, obviously the more and more we convert 3G customers to 4G that affords us the ability to get on a much more efficient network, it affords us the ability to reappropriate our spectrum, and it affords us to actually start to run down if you will the higher cost network of 3G. So, all of that plays into this. The other thing is, as we said before, we have a very cost structure in servicing our customers and you\u2019re going to see some things different of how we approach customers and mainly around getting more around self serve, so that we can do more of the handsets. And we saw over the last two years, starting in 2013 into the 2014, that this played a big role and how we take cost out of the Wireless cost structure. On the Wireline side, it\u2019s just continuing to do more of the same. So we really don\u2019t play up the fact of all the copper to fiber migration. But this is really starting to pay benefits to us. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been doing this for the last three years. We are now in the position of starting to shutdown central offices, which free up real estate for us to monetize and get out of. It reduces the property tax around this. So there\u2019s a lot of efficiencies that come from this. And the other thing is that within the one-time charges, you probably picked up a severance accrual. And in December, the Wireline company already has reduced about 2,300 headcount, including about 1,300 represented workforce, who took an additional incentive for them to voluntary retire. So we are setting the company up once again to produce a very beneficial efficient cost structure going into 2015.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.\nKevin Smithen: Thank you. Wanted to follow-up in your comments about not chasing on profitable subs and upgrades. Does that change if you begin to go negative on phone net adds? Like what is your tolerance for sub losses because in the past that has sort of been a key level where you sort of responded with some retention in offensive marketing?\nFran Shammo: Well, I mean, Kevin, we always have save programs and specific targeting to a specific customer base or a specific segment, so that's not going to change. My point is here is that there are certain customers that will go for the lowest price. And at that point, we\u2019re probably not going to compete on price with those customers and that\u2019s what you saw. I mean, if you look at it for the fourth quarter, we added 672,000 net phone adds. So, I think you have to keep it all in focus that what we are gaining. We are gaining 4G high-value customers and we\u2019re not necessarily losing that 4G high-value customer. So, I think you have to look at it in a holistic point of view, but that's really the strategy that we have deployed and we will continue to execute on our strategy.\nKevin Smithen: And just a quick follow-up. Does your guidance change at all under certain Title II outcomes and what is your current thinking on this given recent government comments?\nFran Shammo: Well, that\u2019s a great question because I personally have been misquoted, both in the press and in Congress on what I've said. So this is a good question for me to clear this up. So first of all, this is not of an issue about Internet rules. It\u2019s about an issue of FCC reclassifying Broadband to Title II service. And this will absolutely affect us and the industry on long-term investment in our networks. And that can be seen factually as to what happened in the rest of the world where you have high regulation, the networks are not invested in, there are not good quality of service networks and that's where this will put us. I guess, I would emphasize also that the approach in whole or in part on Title II is an extreme and risky path that will jeopardize our investment and the development of innovation in Broadband Internet and related services. It will also tie up the industry in a very uncertain time and cause all types of litigation. So when I said before, I misquoted on the fact that it would not hurt our investment, I was talking about 2015. But if this piece of Title II was to pass, I can absolutely assure you, it would certainly change the way we've been view our investment in our networks. The other thing too is, as I think it's important to show that this industry on a high-level basis has invested about $50 billion a year in networks and improving the quality of service and open network to everyone. And that's what the industry belief is, that this is an open internet basis. If we could curtail the investment of this industry, it will definitely trickle down to what we would consider middle-class jobs. And it\u2019s because most of at least, for Verizon Wireless, a lot of our build are done by thousands of contractors across the United States, that will impact those small business and impact their employees. So from that perspective, I guess, what we would say, Kevin, is we would encourage Congress to adopt a legislative solution, Congress has the authority to adopt clear rules of the road that will allow policy makers in the industry to move on to more important things. So, I think, that summarizes the position about Title II.\nKevin Smithen: Very helpful. Thank you.\nFran Shammo: Okay. Time for one more question, David?\nOperator: Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thanks Fran. Just two quick questions if I may, just an update on thoughts around the tower sale, I assume it\u2019s still part of the plan. Secondly, I just wanted to explore the ARPU question, a lot was made of your November 1st price cut? But am I crazy to think you could look at this glass half full, because with 84% of your traffic now on LTE and I think you said 66% you are base on LTE phone? Did you see some movement upward with that price change that actually could have offset any sort of downward movement you saw? Thanks a lot.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Jennifer. Well, on the tower sales, look, I think, we\u2019ve been pretty clear on the remarks here. We are not going to talk about the rumors anymore until there is something that substantially state. So at this point, I think, we\u2019ll just leave it at that. As far as the price cuts, you are absolutely correct, Jennifer. When we look at the provisioning of our base, we have seen a significant increase in the amount of customers who are taking our higher data plans, if you will, that drive more revenue. And even with those higher plans, we still see a large portion of those customers breaking their bundles because of video consumption in the increase in video consumption. So, yes, there is an offset here. It is not all just dilution, there is an upgrade of what customers are using and obviously, we built the plans around LTE, we built the plans around, we want customers to use more, because that's what will generate incremental revenue for the business and give us a return on the continued investment in our network.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you.\nFran Shammo: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay. That\u2019s all the time we have for question, but before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Mike. So at conclusion here, I just want to state that Verizon had another strong year of operating and financial results with topline revenue growth and quality earnings and cash generation. We are very focused on driving growth and profitability. To that end, our execution strategy is around the assets we have in place. As always, we continually look at options for monetizing certain less strategic assets and creating value for our shareholders. We continue to develop new products and services in the area of video delivery, Internet of Things that will drive growth and profitability into 2015 and beyond. We look forward to a very positive 2015 with confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, grow the business profitably and invest for our future. Thank you all for joining today and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-10-21 13:55:11", "content": "Executives: Michael Stefanski - SVP, IR Fran Shammo - CFO\nAnalysts: David Barden - Bank of America Phil Cusick - JPMorgan Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research John Hodulik - UBS Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners \nOperator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I\u2019m here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we\u2019ve posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.  In terms of our financial results, I\u2019ll point out that there were no special items included in our reported earnings for the third quarter of 2014. Earnings per share of $0.89 compares with adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share in the third quarter of last year, an increase of 15.6%. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 were up 21.6%. Keep in mind that the $2.65 per share a year-to-date result in 2014 does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of the year since the transaction close on February 21. As previously noted full ownership from January 01, to the date of closing would have represented an additional $0.07 of earnings per share in the first quarter. For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the business within the public sector that we sold on July 01 have been reclassified for all periods prior to the sale. These results, which previously were part of global enterprise, have been moved to corporate and other, consistent with how we\u2019ve dealt with divested operations in the past. You can access this reclassified historical information on our website.  With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks Mike, good morning everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the consistency of our performance and our ability to compete effectively and deliver strong operating and financial results. We entered the year with great confidence in our ability to generate strong financial performance in 2014 and our conviction has not changed. We believe that steady and consistent investments in networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. Our Wireless and Wireline networks will continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage. The overall industry is very healthy and we continue to see strong customer demand for Wireless and broadband services. U.S. market has set the pace for global broadband infrastructure investments. In Wireless, all four national service providers are investing in 4G networks resulting in continued innovation, 4G device adoption and increase in customer usage. Our competitive position is strong and we\u2019re focused on executing our strategy of providing a compelling value proposition and a great customer experience on the best most reliable network. In the third quarter, we produced very strong customer growth in Wireless and FiOS and sustained our strong growth trends in terms of revenue and earnings. We pride ourselves on being an \u201cand\u201d company, delivering quality growth and profitability. We continue to stand apart from our peers with very consistent high quality earnings results. We have posted double-digit year-over-year growth in reported and adjusted earnings and earnings per share in 10 of last 11 quarters.  In Wireless, we had a very strong quarter of high quality connections growth and profitability. Retail postpaid device activations of 11.7 million were up 14.9%. This is higher volume than the fourth quarter last year, when we activated 11.5 million devices. Retail postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million up 63.5% from last year. Year-to-date postpaid net adds of 3.5 million were up 37.4%, which is roughly 1 million more than a year-ago.  Our Wireless EBITDA service margin was 49.5%. This is a very strong result given the volume of device activations and the relatively low percentage of customers choosing the Edge program in the quarter.  In Wireline, we had a strong quarter in FiOS with 162,000 internet and 114,000 video net subscriber addition. Consumer revenues grew 4.5%. As we continue to drive FiOS penetration and customer adoption of our quantum broadband and video products. Our Wireline EBITDA margin remained stable at 23%. Our strong cash generation enables us to consistently invest in our networks for future growth and return value to our shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2014, we have invested $12.6 billion of capital and paid $5.7 billion in dividend.  In early September, we were pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 3.8% dividend increase which raises our annual dividend to $2.20 per share. This is the 8th consecutive year that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend increase and the highest percent increase since 2008.  Now let\u2019s get into the third quarter performance in more detail starting with the consolidated results on Slide 4. On a reported basis total operating revenue grew 4.3% in the third quarter. If we exclude the revenues of the public sector business we divested from the prior period, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.9% from the third quarter and 5.2% year-to-date.  Our consolidated top-line growth continues to be driven primarily by Wireless and FiOS. In addition to top-line growth, we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma program. Consolidated EBITDA was $11.1 billion in the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 35%.  Let\u2019s take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 5. As I have noted in prior quarters, it is important to remember that the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless create a lack of comparability between the current and prior period in our state in the cash flow. The first nine months of 2014, cash flow from operations were $23.2 billion. Additional cash outlays this year included $2.5 billion of incremental cash interest payments and higher cash income taxes of $3.2 billion. In addition, we had $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not make in 2013. In spite of these additional cash outlets and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $10.5 billion through the end of September. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.1 billion and were $12.6 billion year-to-date up $817 million or 6.9%.  We project that capital spending will be around $17 billion for the full year. Our deployment of capital in Wireless has been very consistent throughout the first three quarters of this year. In the third quarter, Wireless CapEx was $2.5 billion and trough nine months totaled $7.8 billion. We are deploying capital to proactively stay ahead of demand and our capital investments continue to focus on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density and deploying spectrum. We have been actively deploying AWS spectrum across our nationwide footprint, and currently have more than 400 markets with AWS or XLTE as we branded it. Our continued deployment of spectrum along with investments in small sales, distributed antenna systems and in building solutions will allow us to build upon our network advantage.  In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion year-to-date, down $273 million or 6.1%. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Gross debt of $109.2 billion was down $750 million from last quarter. Our net debt position improved to $102 billion and then net debt to adjusted-EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3 times.  Now let\u2019s move into the review of the segment, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. This value proposition includes customer choice and an excellent service experience on the nation\u2019s most reliable network. Our investment strategy is focused on adding capacity to our network to meet increasing demand, which is driven by 4G device adoption and higher customer usage. Growth in Wireless revenue and profitability continues to be driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base, where we continue to see very strong 4G device adoption. As I highlighted earlier, we had another exceptional quarter of smartphone and tablet activations. Customer demand on our network continues to increase at a rapid pace. Our recently announced promotional pricing is designed to provide even greater appeal to our MORE Everything plan which we believe will drive more 4G device adoption and stimulate incremental usage on our more efficient LTE network. We expect that continued success in driving 4G device activations in the fourth quarter will create profitable growth for us as we enter 2015 and beyond. Total Wireless revenues in the quarter grew to $21.8 billion up 7%. Service revenues grew 4.8%, driven by 4G LTE connections growth and higher usage on our network. The declining rate of service revenue growth is attributable to device mix, price changes and the tradeoff between lower service revenue and higher monthly equipment billings for customers on Verizon Edge. In the third quarter the percentage of phone activations by customers choosing Edge program was approximately 12%, which was down from about 18% in the second quarter based on recent promotional pricing for Edge, the percentage of phone activations taking the installment plan option could more than double in the fourth quarter. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and our service EBITDA margin was 49.5%. The EBITDA benefit in the quarter from the Edge program was approximately $115 million. Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on slide 7. Retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 3.5% in the quarter; growth in ARPA is a function of device adoption, accounts growth and increased usage. The continued rapid pace of 4G device adoption is improving the quality of our customer accounts. In the third quarter, we added 4.4 million 4G smartphones and 1.1 million 4G tablets to our postpaid connection space. All of the important account metrics are improving. We ended the quarter with a total of 35.4 million postpaid accounts and the number of postpaid connections per account was 2.82, which is an increase of 3.7%. 57% of our accounts are on MORE Everything share data plan. The average data usage in MORE Everything accounts has increased nearly 50% year-over-year.  I would also point out that since the ARPA metrics is calculated using service revenue, it does not capture the monthly equipment billings from customers on the Edge program. In the third quarter these monthly equipment billings totaled about $285 million and were approximately $533 million year-to-date.  Let\u2019s take a closer look in connections growth on slide 8. We ended the quarter with 106.2 million total retail connections, our industry leading postpaid connections base top the 100 million mark at 100.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million. In passing the 100 million postpaid connections milestone, it is worth noting that we\u2019ve added more than 20 million new connections since 2009, representing a compound annual growth rate of around 5%. Postpaid growth has totaled 4.5 million in the quarter up from 4.2 million in the second quarter and 3.7 million a year ago. Year-to-date postpaid gross adds were up 15.1% in terms of the gross add mix in the third quarter 54% were smartphones and about 36% were connected devices primarily tablet. Most of the remaining gross adds were basic phones. Our retail postpaid churn rate of 1% was 3 basis points higher than the third quarter of last year. As I highlighted earlier, retail postpaid net adds in the quarter totaled 1.5 million compared with 1.4 million in the second quarter and 927,000 a year ago. Our postpaid net add mix in the quarter included 2.3 million new 4G devices. Within that total, 1.2 million were 4G smartphones and 1.1 million were 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled 457,000 which is comparable to 481,000 in the third quarter last year. Within the postpaid phone category, the 1.2 million new 4G smartphone adds were partially offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. Tablet net adds were more than 1 million for the second consecutive quarter. Tablets provide good growth to increase data consumption, lower churn of the account level and have a lower cost subsidies in the smartphones. We have significant headroom in terms of further penetration as our postpaid tablet base was 6.5 million at the end of the quarter. Further customer adoption of tablets clearly represents an incremental growth opportunity for us.  Our postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2% in the third quarter. Once again, these were high quality smartphone upgrades either from a basic phone 3G to 4G or 4G to a newer 4G smartphones, about 1.2 million were 18% of smartphone upgrade this quarter were from basic phones, nearly 50% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve. You will recall that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we activated 3.1 million 3G iPhones as it was the first time we offered a free apple device to customers signing a new two-year contract. A majority of these customers will be coming off contract this quarter providing us with a unique opportunity to try 4G smartphone adoption, almost all of our retail connections growth in 2014 have been postpaid. The first nine months prepaid net adds were only 5000 compared with 274,000 in 2013, we believe that price sensitive prepaid customers are moving to the postpaid market. Next, let\u2019s turn to the Slide 9 and take a look at the device activations and our continued progress in driving 4G adoption and usage. As I have highlighted, postpaid device activations were very strong at 11.7 million. During the quarter, we activated 8.9 million smartphones and 1.3 million tablets. Our smartphone penetration at the end of the quarter increased to 77% of total phones. We have 65.4 million smartphones in total and 48.2 million of them are 4G. A year ago, we had 29 million 4G smartphones that we\u2019ve made significant progress in driving 4G penetration and yet we still have a significant opportunity in front of us with more than 17 million 3G smartphones and 20 million basic phones in our connections space. Beyond smartphones, tablets and other internet devices are contributing to our overall 4G device penetration. At the end of the third quarter, more than 59% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 38% a year ago. Data and video usage on our network continues to rise. Currently about 79% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. As we handle this increased demand, our network continues to be acknowledged as the performance leader and national studies conducted by widely recognized third party organizations. We have raised our own network standards and our performance continues to get better. Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the third quarter, consumer revenue growth was 4.5%, making it 9 consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 4%. Mass market which includes small business grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 76% of consumer revenue and we\u2019re sustaining strong double-digit revenue growth. In the third quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 12.3% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and quantum penetration. Strong adoption of quantum continued at 57% of our FiOS internet customers described of higher speed ranging from 50 megabytes to 500 megabytes per second. We continue to enrich the customer value proposition and drive investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. In the second quarter, we introduced FiOS quantum TV with enhanced features and functionality in terms of storage, recording capabilities and control of content. In July, we introduced Speed Match, a service upgrade that increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds. This competitive advantage provides FiOS customers with faster and more consistent upload speeds, which is compelling for social media and gaming activities. Our focus in FiOS markets is to drive higher penetration by adding quality customers, generating profitable growth in a very competitive market and improving our overall investment returns. In broadband, we added 162,000 net FiOS internet customers in the quarter and now have 6.5 million subscribers representing 40.6% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers in the third quarter were up positive 69,000, up more than 23%. In FiOS video, we added 114,000 net subscribers that we now have 5.5 million subscribers representing 35.5% penetration. During the quarter, we converted 55,000 customers from copper to fiber bringing our year-to-date total to around 200,000. This network evolution initiative is enabling us to systemically upgrade the network and provide higher quality of service to customer. Beside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customer to purchase FiOS services which resulted in additional recurring revenue.  Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover the enterprise and wholesale business. In the enterprise space we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $155 million or 4.4%. Revenue declines in legacy transport services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications which were smaller in scale. Strategic services totaled $2.1 billion and grew 1%. This category, as currently defined, includes both the IP layer and application such as data center, cloud, security and managed and professional services. Revenue from services in the IP layer have been impacted by competitive price compression which is offsetting growth in application services.  In our global wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $79 million or 4.8%. Healthy demand for Ethernet services in each of last few quarters has offset a larger portion than expected as the revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges. In the third quarter, Wireline operating expenses declined 1.7% and our EBITDA margin was 23%. As we said, we are making progress but are not satisfied. We have more work to do in order to drive improved profitability in this segment. On a year-to-date basis, the Wireline EBITDA margin was up 60 basis points to 23%. From an overall segment perspective, our strategy is to continue scaling our FiOS business and improve the enterprise revenue mix by driving growth in the newer strategic services like cloud and security. In addition, we believe that process improvements and retooling efforts using Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principle will improve our cost structure and drive operating efficiency, resulting in a stronger Wireline business.  Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. With three quarters of 2014 behind us, our financial performance has been strong. We continue to deliver high quality double-digit earnings growth and our cash generation is strong, enhanced by full access to all the Wireless cash flows. These cash flows have allowed us to consistently invest in our networks and platforms for future growth and innovation. In addition, we returned value to shareholders with the 3.8% dividend increase. We have a strong market position and that demonstrated the ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy.  Our high quality customer base in Wireless and Wireline continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provides the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are also building for the future through our global platforms in video delivery and machine-to-machine. New revenue streams from machine-to-machine in Telematics are beginning to emerge. In the third quarter these revenues were approximately $150 million and totaled more than $400 million through nine months, an increase of more than 40% year-to-date.  Our strong volume growth in both Wireless and FiOS gives us great confidence heading into the fourth quarter. We continue to target consolidated revenue growth of 4% in 2014. For the full year, our consolidated adjusted-EBITDA margin as well as the Wireless EBITDA service margin results will be dependent on fourth quarter volumes and Edge installment plan take rates. The Wireline EBITDA margin remains on track to expand on a full year basis.  With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions. \nMichael Stefanski:  Thank you, Fran. Before taking questions I would like to remind everyone that we filed an application to participate in the AWS-3 spectrum auction. As a result due to the FCC\u2019s rules, we cannot answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. David we are now ready to take questions. \nOperator:  Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) One moment for the first question. Your first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America:  Hey guys thanks for taking the question. So two if I could. First, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit in light of Lowell\u2019s comments in the briefing about his conviction level, confidence level about 4Q. About the Cadence Competition and how you felt you had to respond over the course of the quarter, obviously things started off fairly stable and then we have the T-Mobile promotion followed by the Sprint promotion followed by incremental actions in terms of double data and things like that. So if you kind of give us a sense us to how the quarter trended and what you are seeing that\u2019s giving you the confidence for the rest of the fourth quarter would be helpful.  And then second Fran, I think that we have got a pretty good understanding that Smartphone customers have been generating roughly double the value of feature phone customers. You are referencing the 4G Smartphone opportunity is beings something incremental to the 3G Smartphone opportunity. If you could put some numbers around that, that would be super helpful. Thank you so much.\nFran Shammo:  Okay, great. Thanks David. So look on the competitive front. I think that the takeaway here is just that we provide an extremely strong quarter from growth perspective and I anticipate you\u2019re going to see that across the industry. If you look at as I said we see a shift from prepaid to postpaid not necessarily within our base because of high quality and strict requirements we have from a credit perspective. But there is still a lot of growth out there. If you look at just the industry itself I mean you take tablets, you take the video consumption, you look at machine-to-machine and internet of things, I mean all these things are contributing to our growth. If you look at machine-to-machine for us it\u2019s the first time we gave you a revenue number and that\u2019s growing to 40% year-over-year. So it\u2019s more than just about a smartphone customer as I said before if I could I would stop disclosing net adds, it\u2019s all about how we build the base of revenue and how we continue to grow this business into the future. If you look at the competitive front, there was a lot of movement but it was not unexpected I mean as you go into the fourth quarter, this is normally a very high competitive quarter, it\u2019s a very high volume quarter for ourselves from a holiday perspective but I think if you look at us as we\u2019ve done in the past we look at what the competition is doing, we take a very rational and logical approach to what we\u2019re going to respond to? If you looked at what we did, we responded with some Edge pricing on a promotional basis that quite honestly puts us back into the market given all the moves we were slightly out of the market like if you saw it back in the first quarter of this year we did similar things and we continue to grow and we continue to produce the profitability that\u2019s expected of our shareholders. So, I think the response you\u2019ve seen is a logical rational response, there will be upcoming promotions I\u2019m sure from everyone as the holiday season gets closer and we have our own plans in place to execute on. So I think from a fourth quarter perspective, you should expect high volume, you should expect from us that our upgrade rate will increase, we have the highest backlog of any previous launch of an iPhone that we have coming into the fourth quarter, which is a high backlog of both new customers and also for upgrades. So I know that our upgrade rate is going to be fairly significant in the fourth quarter as we said on the call here 3.1 million, 2012 3G iPhone customers are waiting to upgrade now as they come out of contracts so that\u2019s a great perspective and that leads me into your second question. So if you think about some of the data points we have given you from a 3G smartphone customer to a 4G smartphone customer, the first time we\u2019ve told you that within our MORE Everything plan which is for the majority 4G smartphone customers. Their usage pattern is going up 50% year-over-year. If you look at tablets, a tablet customer uses more than the 3G smartphone customer. So if you start taking together with the volume increases and other industries have put out what the usage pattern of video customers are on a 4G LTE network, video is a huge consumption for us and it continues to increase quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and that\u2019s driving that 50% increase in usage in our 4G base. So when you combine all of that, every time we can move a customer from a 3G smartphone or a basic phone into our 4G portfolio, their usage and revenue goes up. So it\u2019s a great combination for us. And I\u2019ll end the question that says, again we\u2019re focused on the quality of our base and the quality of our adds to generate our growth.\nMichael Stefanski :  Thank you, David. David will ready for the next question.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan; please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick - JPMorgan:  Hi guys, thanks. Two things one to follow up, Fran something you just said prepaid customers move into the postpaid market is that a good thing or bad thing, do you think these customers offer a similar churn level that pass the credit check. Right? And did they tend to bring their own devices or they taking Edge to the different rate from one feasibility you have and then second there has been a lot of articles written likely on asset sales from you whether that was Wireline assets or towers. Can you give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thanks.\nFran Shammo:  Thanks Phil. On the prepaid customer move to postpaid look I mean, we\u2019re just looking at the overall industry and where prepaid growth is from a year ago to where it is today and the assumption is that we do we see the prepaid customer moving. If you look at the entry prices now that are on postpaid and this is really around single line not multifamily. But if you look at single line pricing, those price points are pretty darn close to what a prepaid customer would pay on prepaid. So the hurdle is there is a credit check and obviously for Verizon we\u2019ve not changed our credit profile for any of our customers it\u2019s same as it has been for over a year now even when Edge was introduced. So, again it\u2019s not as favorable to us it was more of where are these customers going and we think they are going to a lower end type entry point which is not unusual. I mean the same thing happened back in the Voice world when Voice became closer to what the prepaid were. So, from a device perspective some is on device but others are also buying up into device.  As far as the asset sales go, look I\u2019ve nothing to announce today. We said publically that we certainly would entertain a sale of our towers if the terms and conditions were right. And at this point, we don\u2019t have anything there. And as Lowell and I\u2019ve always said, we continue to look at our portfolio for opportunities but it has to be at the right time, the right place, and the right price and so therefore there is really nothing to talk further because there is nothing to announce.\nMichael Stefanski : David next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to maybe a follow-up on the full year margin guidance, it sounds like and correct me if wrong, but it sounds like it\u2019s most sensitive to the Edge take rate and so along those lines in the past you\u2019ve been fairly agnostic or you\u2019ve seen somewhat agnostic as to whether your customers were choosing a subsidy or choosing Edge. I am wondering how you\u2019re changing your thought process, meaning are you trying to achieve desire outcome. You noted that it looks like the take rate could double in the fourth quarter and then just broad levels, is there a breaking point? Meaning if Edge were to see adoption rate above a certain level you probably will have margins that were up and if that was below they probably be down just sort of help us with the modeling exercise?\nFran Shammo : So look, there is a bunch of factors entering into the fourth quarter here. As I said, we do think that the Edge rate will take an uptick and you\u2019ve probably seen us increasing our advertising around the price points of Edge which is where the rest of the industry has been and advertising around. So we need to be in market with those price points which is why we launched the promotional pricing that you saw. But if you look at the 12% this quarter or the 18% last quarter, you can kind of get a flavor on what the impact is to our bottom line, which is 120 basis points this quarter. I think it was 134 basis points last quarter. So beyond that I am not going to give any further information on that, but if you think about the Edge take rate at the double then you can kind of extrapolate what that math would be, but then offsetting that will be the upgrades. And at this point, I don\u2019t know where the upgrade will come whether it will be Edge or onto the old subsidy model. Again, we\u2019re very focused on customer choice, we give our customers the choice of the subsidized handset with the higher service pricing or we give them the edge which they pay for the phone over the term, but it gives them the availability to upgrade sooner. So it is the customer choice and it\u2019s hard for me to identify what that will be. But as I said, Brett, we have a very high volume of backlog on the iPhone. We have a bunch of new phones coming out in the fourth quarter from other manufacturers that are extremely good. So I think we\u2019ll have a great lineup of products. It\u2019s going to be a high volume, highly competitive time of the year and beyond that I\u2019m not going to give any specific guidance to margins but it will certainly be based on those volumes and how those customers come in.\nMichael Stefanski : David next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley: Fran, you\u2019ve talked about a $17 billion number for CapEx, you're coming towards to the end of the ex-LTE rollout, is there some opportunity for the -- it seems like the growth rate have slowed but some CapEx as a percent of revenues to fall over the coming quarters or are we going to continue keeping at this sort of rate as a percentage of revenues? And the on the Wireline side, a bit of softness in SMB and enterprise, you\u2019ve talked about some of the secular factors, do you detect any change in macro or in the competitive environment or is it just more of the same?\nFran Shammo: So on CapEx, we said we\u2019d be around $17 billion. As we\u2019ve said that coming into this year, we were determined to improve our CapEx to revenue ratio and I believe we will do that on a year-over-year basis. This year we had a much more flatness to our CapEx spending, so if you look at prior year we\u2019ve always had more of a ramp into the back half of the year. You won\u2019t see that this year, so it\u2019s become more level and I do anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to continue to improve on our CapEx-to-revenue ratio. As far as whole dollars go, we set around the $17 billion mark and I\u2019ll give you some more guidance in January, but I don\u2019t anticipate that that will change pretty materially going into the next year. So again, the focus will be to continue to increase that CapEx-to-revenue ratio.  And then on the Wireline side, first let\u2019s talk about the consumer small business area, so we did have an inflexion point this quarter where we did suffer a 4.1% decline in the small business and some of that was due a year-over-year comparison but some of that due to some onetime things and I think that will come back in line here in the fourth quarter. But we did have a very good strong FiOS quarter at 4.5%. The other thing I would say around FiOS is, if you look at the components of content and our revenue per customer, our revenue per customer is growing nicely and is actually outpacing the cost of content. And this year, if you look at our content cost, we\u2019re around that 2% to 4% growth rate in content. So from a competitive standpoint that\u2019s an advantage for us to drop more margins to the bottom on our consumer piece and if you look at FiOS, FiOS continues to contribute more and more net income quarter-over-quarter, so that\u2019s a positive. On the Enterprise side, look I think that I feel like I record this every quarter and it does not change. I really don\u2019t see much change in the Enterprise spectrum. If you look at the European market and it\u2019s softening for us and also with the FX impact to some of that softness of where the dollar is. So I think where we have a lot of headwinds right now in Enterprise and I will honestly tell you I don\u2019t see that changing for at least the next couple of quarters at this point in time.\nMichael Stefanski : David next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question. \nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research:  Hi, thanks for taking the question. Fran you referenced that the MORE Everything plans were generating 50% greater usage year-over-year. Is there a way to think about how much revenue that usage is contributing? And how you feel about the ability to monetize the growth in consumption in some of the rate plans have promoted higher usage buckets? Thanks. \nFran Shammo:  Yeah, thanks Michael. So look, I am not going to give you specific how the revenue increases. I mean you can see that in our ARPA which is growing nicely if you see the sequential improvement in ARPA this quarter. From last quarter it grew to a 161 from 159. So if you look at year-over-year we are up 3.5%. So I think that metrics speaks for itself as how we are monetizing the increased usage. But if you think about this the 4G LTE network is three to four times more efficient than prior network. So I guess I look at it this way, if you back in time and you go back to the voice world. And you go from the beginning of time to where that voice world matured. What happened was the price per minute decreased and usage increased, and the overall industry increased its revenue because of that increase in usage. And I, kind of, look at the data world in the same perspective. You are going to see the price per megabit decreased but the usage is going to outpace that. And at least our Tier pricing structure and the MORE Everything planned. Each time you upgrade you are going to incrementally pay a little bit more for what you use. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s favoring in on the revenue growth. But it\u2019s also coming over very efficient network that does not cost incrementally to produce that increased usage.  So it\u2019s a good combination to have in efficient network with an ever increasing consumption rate. So I do anticipate that the structure works. I think it\u2019s going to grow, as long as we increase the data bundle usage on a competitive standard basis. I still think though with the increasing usage as we said 50% year-over-year you are still going to see a healthy growth in the revenue on an ARPA basis. So think the combination works. But you will see that megabit or price per megabit decrease with the continued increase in consumption. \nMichael Rollins - Citi Investment Research:  Thanks. \nMichael Stefanski:  Next question please David?\nOperator:  Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS:  Thank you. Fran maybe a quick follow-up to Mike\u2019s question on the service revenue. I mean similar margins there is a lot of moving parts as we look into fourth quarter. But you saw a 100 basis points of service revenue growth deceleration. You are going to be having more Edge come through. Is that the kind of deceleration we should see again in the fourth quarter or does it do all the upgrades sort of offset that. That\u2019s number one. And then number two. Apple obviously recently announced they move to soft SIM card at least for the iPads, the new iPad that they are introducing. Verizon was conspicuously absent from the companies in the U.S. supporting that. Can you give a little color in terms of your position in terms of that new product? Thanks. \nFran Shammo:  Sure, thanks. So on the service revenue side, look there is a lot of puts and pushes here from a service revenue perspective. So if you go back I mean obviously we had a price change in the first quarter which is working its way through the system as we said before we were not going to reprice our base in one lump sum. We would work on that and address those customers that were a high churn profile, and treat them accordingly which we have done for many many years and we continue to do that. And that puts a pressure on service revenue as we get them into the price plan that\u2019s going to keep them on our network.  In addition, Edge has an impact here because you are moving service revenue into equipment revenue when we gave you those numbers in the upfront comments of how you should think about that. But that improves the -- if you take those recurring monthly billings on equipment revenue and put them back into the revenue stream that increases the rate of percentage increase that we have and also increases the service revenue growth year-over-year. But look there is some deceleration here as Michael brought up on the last one. As we continue to increase the bundles, this is going to take a little bit of time before people have to take the next step up. But I will tell you this quarter with our NFL agreement and the amount of video consumption we are having. We had one of the best quarters ever of customers stepping up for the next bucket.  So, again I think all these things factor into it, but Edge will definitely have a deceleration factor on the service revenue. As far as the soft card SIM card with Apple. We have our own SIM card that we are putting in the devices both in our indirect channels and our store channel. So that\u2019s really all that is to be said on that issue. \nJohn Hodulik - UBS:  Okay, thanks Fran. \nMichal Stefanski:  David next question please?\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. \nMike McCormack - Jefferies LLC:  Hey guys, thanks. Fran could you just hit briefly on the small medium enterprise marketplace. It seems like you have continued weakness what you pointed out. How much of that is technology migration versus the cable competitors starting to move up market a little bit. And then secondly thinking about over the top there is been a lot of stuff in the past couple of weeks and it seems like sort of a building discussion between HBO, CBS. How do you guys think about that? I know bought the Intel OnCue business. When do you get more aggressive there?\nFran Shammo:  Okay, thanks Mike. So look on the enterprise space, I think there is a couple of things here. I mean you do have the Tech Refresh and obviously as they come off legacy and going into IP. I mean the IP has a lower price point. And then also as I said in my opening remarks this IP market is becoming more and more competitive from a pricing perspective. So as what we\u2019re faced with as we have major customers who are renewing coming off 3 and 5 year contracts. Obviously, they\u2019re being reprised back into where the IP market is today which is pretty significantly lower than it was 3 to 5 years ago. So, you\u2019re having that pricing pressure happen there we\u2019re gaining new business but again it\u2019s coming in at a lower rate and we still have that decline of voice and LB that\u2019s going away and it just can\u2019t offset it. From a strategic services perspective, we\u2019re seeing some good things here we\u2019re also seeing some improvement in the federal space but as you know in this business when you start to improve it could take 6 to 8 months before that revenue comes to be as you implement this new technology.  So there is some glimmer of hope here as the federal government starts to purchase more but we\u2019re probably not going to see any of that until \u201815 but then again that we\u2019re working against the bunch of headwinds as far as repricing on the IP in the tech refresh. As far as cable and what\u2019s happening in the small business, look I mean, as I said in the previous quarters where we have FiOS and compete in the small business market we\u2019re gaining share. We\u2019re losing share outside of that FiOS footprint in the old copper and I\u2019m not going to be able to compete there with the speed. So that is something that we\u2019re just going to continue to see here into the future around that copper plant. But within FiOS we continue to gain share, we expand where we can to capture more small businesses in that footprint and we capitalize on that but we\u2019ve to remember it\u2019s only in 13 states.\nUnidentified Company Representative :  As far as over the top goes I think that the way I look at this is great for the customer, this is great for the industry this shows that there are new innovative type arrangements that are happening and as we said before we\u2019re having discussions with a lot of content providers around innovative models going forward and I think this sets a lot of space so I think it opens up a lot of doors and it\u2019s something optimistic for the future of the video business.\nMike McCormack - Jefferies LLC:  Okay, and just like a quick follow up on the small medium piece of it, do you see cable gaining more capabilities there, or there is still really relegated to the very small customer base?\nFran Shammo :  Well, when they say that they are moving up my perception of this as we\u2019ve look at small medium business and then even in the medium business we capture medium business as anyone that has a 1,000 or less employees so it\u2019s a pretty different definition of where they\u2019re seeing they\u2019re moving up from versus where we are playing. And again within our enterprise business we\u2019re really focused on the major large enterprise customers and we really deal with that small business which is what we classify as 20 and below employees within our FiOS arena.  So it is a different spectrum of definition but look they are increasing their capability, they\u2019re having success in that what I would consider small business arena maybe the lower and mid business level but they\u2019ll continue to do what they do and we\u2019ll continue to do what we do.\nMike McCormack - Jefferies LLC:  Great, thanks guys.\nMichael Stefanski :  Next question please.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie; please go ahead with your question.\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie:  Thanks Fran, can we talk a little bit about your net debt targets? Obviously with the spectrum auction coming up potential assets sales, all of this stuff is going impact your ability to deleverage going forward. Can you talk a little bit about kind of where we should think about net debt at the end of \u201915 and given the lower interest rate environment, does that change your calculus on the amount of leverage you want to leave on the balance sheet?\nFran Shammo:  Thanks Kevin. So, it is what I\u2019ll say because I\u2019m not going to give any guidance of where I think our debt will be in \u201915 at this point but today where we stand is as you see where we\u2019re at net debt of $102 billion with our gross debt at $109.2 billion, we have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 and the gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5. I\u2019ll reference you back to S&P report that came out like maybe a month ago on some projections around what they thought, we would spend in the future for auctions and also how much debt that they think that we would pay down and report was extremely optimistic and said that they could see us being upgraded within the 12 to 24 month period of time as things continue. So, I think we are right on track with where we said we would be when we close on the Vodafone deal I said that, we wanted to get back to A minus rating within 4 to 5 years, the S&P report shows that, that could be accelerated based on our performance here. We are generating strong cash flow and what I would tell you is we\u2019re in a great position to execute on the strategic initiative that we need to execute on but we\u2019ll have more to say on this as we close out this year and come to our call in January.\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie:  And just quickly on FiOS, we\u2019ve seen a last few years significant price hikes which as you indicated is more than offset programming cost increases kind of as you look at the \u201915, should we expect more of that and can you too have revenue growth outpace cost inflation on the FiOS side?\nFran Shammo: Yes, so I will guidance next call on where we think FiOS growth rate will be but here is what I\u2019ll say is, last year we did our price increases in the fourth quarter we\u2019re doing that again this year to be ready to absorb the content cost that always happen on January 01, so that\u2019s something that you should anticipate and you will see.\nKevin Smithen - Macquarie: Thanks.\nMichael Stefanski:  Next question please.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Fran, just building on Mike\u2019s prior question on the recent developments around over-the-top and unbundling, it seems as though you feel pretty comfortable around the opportunity particularly giving you investment in fiber and delivering from these high bandwidth capabilities to you customer. I was wondering if you think about the competitive landscape and developments like this, does it strengthen your view on the diminishing ability for competitive direct video services like satellite technology to compete, and what seems to be an increasing on-demand and OTT world?  And then I guess secondly, if we think about the opportunity on the Wireless side, you folks have made a number of tuck-in acquisitions around content distribution and I was wondering how we should think about and obviously there is the relationship with the NFL, how we should think about the opportunities on that front? And when we could start to see some either material adoption from customers or sort of some of these new revenue streams come to fruition? Thanks a lot.\nFran Shammo: So a couple of thoughts here Amir, so number one is when I look at the, quote, over-the-top type of video area, I mean there is two avenues there is the over-the-top into the home and there is the over-the-top via Wireless. And I think over-the-top via Wireless you\u2019re already starting to see that with agreements like the NFL and some other things. I also think that with the technology of multicast coming, this will certainly open up doors for more of that content to be delivered over-the-top via the Wireless network because multicast is so efficient in delivering a programming type service over the LTE network. But of course that will be major around more live events concerts, sports those types of things. As far as over-the-top into the broadband home, I think that what this says is that the content providers there have realized that there is a whole population out there that do not subscribe the satellite TV or linear TV and they\u2019re trying to penetrate that millennial base that does not have these types of offers and wants something smaller, more convenient for them. And as I said, I think this brings in a lot of innovative type models of how to really attack some of these other segments of the marketplace that don\u2019t have that type of service. Do I think in the near-term, this is going to decrease linear TV or satellite TV? No, I don\u2019t. But I think it\u2019s another avenue of how we open up the ecosystem with innovative models and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re very-very interested in especially around Wireless and even as we go out into more of the broadband type market.\nMichael Stefanski: David next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with question.\nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo: Fran, I realized you can\u2019t talk about the AWS-3 Auction, but I wanted to explore the broadcast auction, last time we\u2019ve heard from you, you said there you needed to know more about the rules to kind of express your enthusiasm. We know little bit more today, I just wanted kind of take your pulse on what your thoughts are as we look at it today?\nFran Shammo: Yes, so Jennifer unfortunately, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not actually allowed to -- my lawyers have told me I am not allowed to answer any type of spectrum questions, and at this point, it\u2019s still far in the future and we\u2019re focused on the current one. So I think at this point, I\u2019ll leave it at that.\nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo: Got it, if I could just explore just an M2M question then.\nFran Shammo: Sure.\nJennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo: Obviously, great growth there, you\u2019ve guided or talked about 40% growth year-over-year. Do you think we\u2019re the point we\u2019re kind of seeing this near move or we\u2019ve often then dream for or is this the year really accelerating \u201814, \u201915 rather?\nFran Shammo: Well, I think that as we try to allude over the last couple of quarters, we gave you growth rate this quarter. We\u2019re giving you revenue numbers and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward. As I said before, this is not necessarily about how many connections I put on the network. This is about how many of those connections actually pay revenue when we earn money. And so as you know we stopped this closing connection a while ago. But I will tell you that the connection growth is ever increasing here. There is a lot of avenues that are being open up around Internet of Things, around healthcare, around energy management fleet. So you can go through all the verticals and there is some many solutions that are coming to forbear, which is why over -- I guess now a year and half ago, we opened up our second innovation center out in Palo Alto. So this is something that we\u2019re very-very focused on, I think there is a lot of good opportunity here and this will certainly be a driver of growth for the entire industry. The other thing I think that separates us apart from our competition is obviously with our Hughes acquisition. We play an another tower that no one else plays, I mean everybody is playing today in the connectivity tower, but with our Hughes acquisition, we\u2019re actually playing in the customer service and concierge tower as well and being able to deliver some of that big data and looking at ways to monetize some of that data to our end customers who are really business customers, who are looking at business-to-business versus business-to-consumers. So this is just another area, I think of growth for the industry and obviously we\u2019re capable to capitalize on that.\nMichael Stefanski: David, we have time for one more question please.\nOperator: And you last question today comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nJonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners: I got a question on LTE broadcast, I just wanted to get an update on where we were and understand whether sort of implementation go forward as about technology or is it about content? And then Fran, you\u2019ve made some interesting comments about sort of the growth of video within the date consumption packages that you currently have. And I\u2019m wondering if you looked at what amount of that video could ultimately be sent out over LTE broadcast and potential implications to margins? Thanks.\nFran Shammo :  Sure, thanks Jonathan. So look, LTE multicast, the network was ready in August of this past year so we have to build out the network to be able to handle multicast as you know we demonstrated it back in January with the Super Bowl where the network is capable, the chipsets are now being implemented into most of the devices that are coming out in the fourth quarter, some phones in the third quarter have those chipsets but most will have it in the fourth quarter not all. So look, the way I look at this ecosystem is that\u2019s going to us about a year before those chipsets ramp and there we have some volume there which gets the attention of the content provider. But as I said before having a lot of great conversations with content providers they\u2019re excited about it but again they want to see how many customers actually have the capability to use that technology and I think that will be a year away but I think that opens up a lot of new avenues for us. I don\u2019t know yet what the -- how the ecosystem will generate revenue on this, is it a revenue share model, is it an advertising model, this is a consumer pay model, we\u2019re not sure yet of how the ecosystem will play itself out and I think that will come within the next year. The other critical piece here is that for the first time coming in the fourth quarter we\u2019ll have an independent third party to be tell the content providers who actually watches their shows on a mobile handset which has never been able to be done before other than from the carriers. So I think this does again open up some of that ecosystem. So, from that perspective I think we\u2019re really in good shape from an ecosystem perspective and as far as the bundling goes and the usage goes again what the way to see how this multicast technology comes to market and how it\u2019s capitalized on it.\nMichael Stefanski:  Alright, thank you but before we end the call I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Fran for few closing remarks.\nFran Shammo:  Thanks Mike and thanks everyone for joining us today. Here is my closing comments I guess I\u2019d say look, we had another strong quarter of operating and financial results, we count ourselves on a quality base and a quality addition. We count on the quality of our network and driving top line growth and profitability. By focusing on execution around the assets we already have in place we\u2019re delivering consistent high quality earnings and returning value to our shareholders. At the same time we\u2019re developing new products and services in the areas of video delivery, over the top, machine-to-machine for future growth and profitability. We have great confidence in our ability to execute on our strategy and grow the business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future. Thank you everyone for joining us today and have a great day.\nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I\u2019m here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. We appreciate you joining us earlier than our usual time this morning. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran takes you through the details of our quarterly performance, I would like to cover a special item that is included in our reported results on Slide 3. For the second quarter of 2014, we reported earnings of $1.01 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a pre-tax gain of $707 million related to the sale of 700 megahertz A block spectrum licenses. On the after tax basis, this gain increased reported net income by $434 million or $0.10 per share. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve accounted for the gain on the sale of these licenses at the corporate level, so it is not part of our Wireless segment results. Excluding the effect of this non-operational item, adjusted earnings per share was $0.91 for the second quarter compared with $0.73 a year ago or growth of 24.7%. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share were $1.76 compared with $1.41 last year up 24.8%. Keep in mind that the $1.76 per share first half result does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless for the entire first quarter since the transaction closed on February 21st. As discussed on our first quarter call, full ownership for the quarter represents as an additional $0.07 per share of earnings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We entered 2014 with the great confidence in our ability to grow the business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future. In the first quarter, we closed the Vodafone transaction and delivered strong financial results. On our last earnings call, I indicated that we exited the first quarter with better momentum and expected that to carry forward. As you can see from our second quarter results, we delivered on what we said, producing very strong customer growth metrics and Wireless and FiOS, in driving excellent top line growth and profitability. We are competing effectively in all markets and executing our strategy which is focused on providing network reliability and a great customer experience. Over the past two and a half years, we have delivered consistent high quality earnings results with double-digit year-over-year growth and reported and adjusted earnings per share in nine of the last 10 quarters. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 represented another quarter of more than 20% growth. This sustained earnings growth demonstrates our ability to execute effectively in all parts of the business in a highly competitive environment. Our consolidated revenue performance was strong with growth accelerating to 5.7%, our highest growth rate in the past six quarters. In Wireless, we had a great quarter of both growth and profitability. 4G device activations were exceptionally strong resulting in $2.3 million 4G postpaid net adds. Total postpaid net additions top $1.4 million, total operating revenue grew 7.5% with service revenue growth of 5.9% and our EBITDA service margin was 50.3%. In Wireline, we also had a good quarter with improved growth and margin expansion. Quarterly operating revenue grew 0.3% which is a milestone led by consumer growth of 5.3% as we continue to drive FiOS penetration and customer adoption of our quantum broadbrand and video products. Wireline EBITDA increased 4.9% and the EBITDA margin improved to 23.2% up 90 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. Our cash generation continues to be very strong enabling us to consistently invest in our networks for future growth and innovation. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion in the quarter and totaled $6.3 billion for the first half. Now, let\u2019s get into our second quarter performance in more detail starting with consolidated results on Slide 5. Total operating revenue grew 5.7% in the quarter continuing our consistent and improving top line growth trend. Revenue increases were once again driven by Wireless and FiOS. As we indicated last quarter, new revenue streams from machine-to-machine and Telematics while still relatively small are beginning to emerge and make positive contributions with revenue growth of more than 50% in the quarter. Our continued focus on driving process improvements and cost-efficiencies is also paying off. In the second quarter, adjusted operating income increased 10.4%. To my earlier point about consistent earnings growth, we have also delivered double-digit growth and adjusted operating income in nine of the 10 quarters. On an adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA grew 6.4% to $11.1 billion. And our EBITDA margin was up 30 basis points to 35.4%. Let\u2019s take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 6. As we previously discussed, it is important to know the lack of comparative ability between the current and prior periods in our statement of cash flows as result of the transaction to require a full ownership of Verizon Wireless. In 2014, the cash flows from operations line will include higher cash payments for interests and taxes. The cash flows from financing section will have lower cash distributions to Vodafone and higher overall dividend payments to our shareholders due to the increase and shares outstanding. In the first half of 2014, cash flows from operations worth $14.8 billion which included an incremental $1.2 billion of cash interest payments, $1.5 billion in cash taxes and $800 million of pension funding that we did not have in the first half of 2013. In spite of this additional uses of cash and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $6.3 billion year-to-date. Again, the key point on cash flows is a simple one. The amount of cash available task will be significantly greater this year than some of the former partnership structure, 45% of any excess cash at Wireless would at some point be distributed to Vodafone. So even after a higher interest payment and greater cash taxes, we will have more cash available at the corporate level than prior to the transaction. I would also point out that we received $2.4 billion in cash flow in the quarter from the transaction to sell wireless licenses to T-Mobile. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.3 billion and we\u2019re $8.5 billion year-to-date up about $900 million or 11.5%. Wireless capital spending in the second quarter was $2.5 billion. And through the first half totaled $5.3 billion, well ahead of what we spent through the first half of last year. We are investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. As we\u2019ve said, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network primarily by increasing network density and the point spectrum. We are actively deploying AWS spectrum across our nationwide footprint and currently have more than 350 markets with AWSF or XLTE as we are branding it. The continued deployment of AWS and the addition of small sales distributed in terms of systems and the in building solutions will fortify our network advantage. In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter and $2.7 billion year-to-date which we\u2019re down $219 million or 7.4%. Our balance sheet remained strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business. Gross stat of just under $110 billion was essentially unchanged from the last quarter. Our Net Debt position improved to about $104 billion and the Net Debt to adjusted EBITDA Ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.4 times. Now let\u2019s move into review with the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. Our capital investment strategy is focused on adding capacity to the network to meet increasing 4G device adoption which will drive higher customer usage. As I highlighted earlier, we have an exceptional quarter of 4G Smartphone and tablet activations with increase in gross addition and upgrades. We also did an excellent job in terms of customer retention. The increase in device volume was driven by a combination of factors starting with the compelling value proposition of our new MORE Everything plans on our high quality 4G LTE network. As you know, we refresh our pricing in framework and value proposition in the first quarter. Within this plans, we are providing customers a choice between the traditional two years service contracts with subsidize devices of Verizon Edge where customers make monthly installment payments with their devices that receive discounted monthly service pricing. We are also driving 4G device adoption with attractive tablet offers. Our sales strategy in the second quarter dramatically improved customer growth which created strong minimum for us as we entered the second half of the year. Total Wireless revenues grew to $21.5 billion up 7.5%. Our service revenues grew 5.9% to $18.1 billion. This was the first full quarter of discounted service pricing for customers on Verizon Edge. A portion of the sequential decline in the rate of growth was due to the tradeoff between the lower service revenue and higher monthly equipment billings. The percentage of phone activations by customers choosing Edge increased to about 18% in the quarter up from about 13% in the first quarter. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.8%. As I highlighted earlier, our service EBITDA margin was 50.3%, 50 basis point higher than a year ago. The estimated benefit to EBITDA in the quarter from Edge was not significantly different than in the first quarter due to the cumulative impact of service price discounts in the program. Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 8. Our service revenue growth was once again driven by 4G smartphone and tablet adoption as well as increased data usage. Retailed postpaid revenue per account or ARPA moved 4.7% which was down from 6.3% in the first quarter. Again, more than half of the decline in the rate of growth resulted from this being the first full quarter of discounted monthly service pricing from Edge. Since ARPA is calculated using service revenue, it does not capture the monthly equipment billings from customers on the Edge program. In the second quarter, monthly equipment billings totaled about $180 million which was significantly higher than the first quarter. We continued to see good additional device adoption within our customer accounts. We ended the second quarter with an average of 2.8 retail connections per account, an increase of 3.7%. About 55% of our 35.2 million postpaid accounts have subscribed to MORE Everything shared data plans. Increased usage per device and per account continues to drive step ups to higher data tiers. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $104.6 million total retail connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection space reached $98.6 million and prepaid totaled just over $6 million. Postpaid gross additions in the quarter were significantly higher both sequentially and year-over-year. Our 4.2 million postpaid gross add were 18.1% higher than a year ago in terms of the gross add mix, more than half for smartphones at about 40% more internet devices primarily tablets. Our retail postpaid term rate of that 9.4% was much improved from the first quarter and only one basis point higher than the second quarter of last year. As we previously said, postpaid net additions were very strong and totaled 1.441 million up 900,000 sequentially at about 500,000 from last year. As I highlighted earlier, our postpaid net additions included 2.3 million new 4G devices. Within that total more than 1 million were 4G smartphones and 1.2 million were 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled a positive 304,000 as the 1 million new 4G smartphones were partially offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. For the third straight quarter, we had company record setting tablet net adds. While 4G smartphones provide the highest value, tablets provide a very good incremental value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. Tablets also have a lower cost subsidy than smartphones. We see tablet as the highly profitable growth opportunity with significant headroom in terms of further penetration. Our postpaid tablet base is only 5.4 million. So we have a great opportunity with these devices to generate growth in 2014 and beyond. Turning now to customer upgrades. Our postpaid upgrade rate increased sequentially to 7.1% for the quarter. Once again, these were high quality upgrades. About 90% of all upgrades in the quarter were smartphones. Consistent with our plan to drive 4G smartphone penetration about 1.4 million or 23% of our smartphone upgrades were from basic phones. About half of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve. Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and take a look at device activations and our continued progress in terms of 4G adoption and usage. Postpaid device activations which we include both gross adds and upgrades increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Second quarter activations totaled 11.1 million up 10.2%. Smartphone activations totaled 8.3 million, 92% of which were 4G. Our smartphone penetration increased to nearly 75% of our total phones. We ended the quarter with 63.5 million smartphones and about 69% of those were 4G. So we still have about 20 million 3G smartphones and almost 22 million basic phones in our base which provides us with a good upgrade opportunity. Our overall 4G device penetration continues to steadily increase. At the end of the second quarter nearly 55% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 33% a year ago. Data and video usage on our network continues to rise. Currently about 76% of total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. We carry more traffic on our Wireless network than any of our competitors. This network advantage continues to be acknowledged by national surveys from widely recognized third party organizations. More importantly, our own stringent drive testing shows that we are continuing to improve our network performance. Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11. In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the second quarter, Consumer revenue growth was 5.3% making it eight consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 4%. Mass markets which includes small business grew 4.2%. FiOS now represents 75% of consumer revenue and we are sustaining strong double-digit revenue growth. In the second quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 13.4% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and Quantum penetration. We continue to see strong adoption of Quantum as 55% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribe to the higher speeds ranging from 50 to 500 megabits per second. We continue to enrich the customer value proposition and drive investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. We recently introduced FiOS Quantum TV with enhanced features and functionality in terms of storage, recording capabilities and control of content. While still in the early stages, we are pleased with the initial adoption of this differentiated TV viewing experience by existing and new customers. In our FiOS markets, we continue to focus on adding quality customers and generating profitable growth in a very competitive market environment. In Broadband, we added 139,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the second quarter and now have 6.3 million subscribers representing 40% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers in the quarter were a positive 46,000. In FiOS video, we added 100,000 new subscribers in the quarter. So we now have 5.4 million subscribers representing 35% penetration. During the quarter, we also converted about 70,000 customers from copper to fiber. This network initiative continues to be important as we systematically upgrade our network and provide higher quality of service. Aside from maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services which result in additional recurring revenue. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and review our overall Wireline segment revenue and profitability. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the second quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $70 million or 1.9%. Revenue declined in Legacy Transport Services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications which are smaller in scale. Strategic Services which include Private IP, Ethernet, Datacenter, Cloud, Security and Managed Services, grew 3%. In our Global Wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $92 million or 5.5%. While we continue to see healthy demand for Ethernet services, positive growth continues to be more than offset by price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges. As I highlighted earlier, total Wireline growth turned positive this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to see some fluctuation in year-over-year growth rates. We are making progress but are not satisfied, we have much more to do here. We are focused on continuous improvements particularly in driving operating efficiencies. Wireline EBITDA increased 4.9% and the EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points in the quarter to 23.2%. We continue to target increased Wireline EBITDA and margin expansion in 2014. As Lowell and I have both stated we continually look for opportunities to streamline the business and monetize non-strategic assets. To that end, on July 1st, we closed the transaction for the sale of the unit within our public sector business with revenues of about $600 million in 2013. A majority of which was equipment. Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. As always, the foundation of our success is the steady and consistent investment in networks and platforms. These networks and platforms form the building blocks for the innovative products and services that will fuel our growth and improve the customer experience. Our Wireless and Wireline networks continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage. We had a strong first half of 2014, with consolidated revenue growth of 5.2% and 36% adjusted EBITDA margin representing 90 basis points of margin expansion. We continue to deliver high-quality double-digit earnings growth and we have a much stronger cash position with the full access to Wireless cash flows. We have great confidence heading into the second half of the year and we remain on track to achieve our revenue growth, margin expansion and capital spending targets for the year. We have strong momentum in Wireless and expect to build on that strength driving further penetration of 4G smartphones and tablets while extending our network leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets, and continue to differentiate ourselves with the superior Quantum broadband and video products. In the Enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms, demonstrating that we have a unique set of capabilities to provide for customer solutions. As always, we will remain extremely focused on profitable revenue growth and will continue to drive network and cost structure improvements, utilizing our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principles. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you, Fran. David, we\u2019re now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan: Hey guys, thanks. So one in Wireless and one the Wireline, if I may. Wireless postpaid account growth reaccelerated on 2Q, what do you think drove that rebound on account growth? And you said you have some strong momentum. Can we expect to continue through the rest of the year? And then on Wireline revenue was positive for the first time in years and margins improved more than we expected. What should we look forward there going forward for both revenue and margins? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Hi. Thanks, Phil, good morning. On the account growth, look, I think it was a number of things. I think the key to us right now is I would center around customer choice. We are giving our customers the choice to select what best fits them whether it\u2019s the EDGE program or it\u2019s the legacy adoption of a subsidy model. And as you can see from a service revenue growth performance, we are really centered around driving the attachment rate of devices generating more data on the individual network. So we\u2019re attracting customers to our network based on its performance. You can tell from that a customer choice perspective, many of our customers selected to stay with the legacy subsidy model as, I as I said on my prepared remarks, our take rate was only 18% for the quarter. I know I said in the first quarter, I expected that to accelerate to 30% with the introduction of indirect channels and the competitive environment. But during the holiday season, we really stuck with our game of giving customers the choice of that Edge program, but we ran a lot of promotions around handsets related to Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day. And I think that drove significant traffic to our stores. So from here, you should expect the same thing going into the third quarter that we will continue to address that marketplace. As far as our base goes, we saw great progress in our base by really reducing the churn. And as I said before, we were going to systematically address our base and take care of the customers who are coming out of contract and we felt that would churn to go somewhere else, we proactively went after those customers and made sure that they were satisfied with their pricing model and with their experience. And I think that proved to be the right model for us. I think we also addressed our basic to smartphone customer base by having a very good quarter, this quarter, of 1.4 million phones from basic phones up into the 4G smartphone category and also 3G to 4G smartphones. So when you consolidate all of this with the excellent tablet growth quarter we had \u2013 and again, I think tablets are extremely good for the industry, not just for Verizon. And from an industry perspective, I think everybody will see the same thing that says, these tablets are lower subsidy, they reduce churn in the account level. So we see that when someone has a tablet in the account, their churn is lower than the overall churn of a normal customer base. This device drives incremental revenue from an access standpoint. But more importantly, I think, and I\u2019ll give you a data point here, these 4G tablets drive more usage on the network than a 3G smartphone. So when you consolidate that into an account level pricing arrangement, customers buy up because they\u2019re using more data. So this is all good. And then of course, as we mentioned in the beginning from a service revenue perspective and account growth, machine-to-machine is becoming at a more important role there. So I\u2019ll stop there, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have more questions around Wireless. From a Wireline perspective, I guess I would put it this way. FiOS continues to be the driver of the Wireline revenue growth, continue to center around our pricing actions on the FiOS platform, continue to innovate and move people into our Quantum Broadband which provides an incremental increase to us. We launched our \u2013\nOperator: Michael Rollins from Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research: Thanks, good morning. Fran, if I could just ask a couple of questions. First on the Wireless side, with respect to phone ad, should that a follow some of the historical, I guess, you call it seasonality that you\u2019ve seen in the past where I think last year, you talked about increasing ad performance as you moved through each quarter? And on the strategic side, could you talk about maybe what else Verizon could consider from an asset optimization perspective and maybe just an update on how things like VDMS and connected car are doing? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Okay. Thanks, Michael. So on the phone and net adds, obviously, again, as I said, we came out strong during the marketing periods of Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day and normally, the second quarter is only better than the first quarter. I think that through this year of obviously for the back half of this year, we\u2019re going to have several dynamic devices come to market that will certainly fuel for the industry, a lot of opportunity for growth here. So I think from our perspective, we\u2019ll stay to our game plan. I\u2019m not going to predict at this point what net adds will be from our phone net add for the third quarter that has a lot around that the competitive environment and customer base, but I would anticipate that you\u2019ll see strong performance from Verizon Wireless. As far as our other strategic areas, so Verizon Digital Media Services launched their commercial service this year. We have a number of customers who are under contract and we\u2019re actually starting to generate revenue all from that platform. It\u2019s early stages here. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity within that platform and we will continue to move on that strategy. As far as Telematics goes, this goes into our machine-to-machine category. And as I said in my prepared remarks here, I will tell you, this was one of the highest connection quarters we had from a machine-to-machine on a companywide basis which would include Verizon Wireless, Hughes Telematics and some of our enterprise customers. And that fueled that 50% year-over-year growth. So machine-to-machine continues to be a critical component. I would also tell you, if you have a chance to visit one of our destination stores with Verizon Wireless, you immediately walk in a store and you can visually see all of the technology around gaming and music and fitness that can be connected to our network. And these things are being sold quite substantially on a quarterly basis through our Verizon Wireless distribution stores. So again, this is a very important category, I think, not only for us but for the industry. And as we\u2019ve continually said, we believe that machine-to-machine will be a future growth engine for us for years to come and that is consistent with our strategy.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay. David, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much, good morning. Fran, you talked about the strong cash flow in the quarter. It looks like there\u2019s an opportunity potentially for bonus depreciation to be extended again. You had $6 billion of cash on a balance sheet here. It looks like you\u2019re doing some refis on your balance sheet. Can you just talk about your overall financial strategy? It looked an opportunity here to delever a little bit more to refi, but there\u2019s also spectrum auctions coming in. And how that all place into dividend and policy given the 20% plus EPS growth? Is there an opportunity here despite the leverage to maybe see faster dividend growth? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Simon. So in a cash flow, yes. I mean, obviously, we have a significant strong cash flow here. And obviously, we said that at the onset of acquiring Verizon Wireless that we will get 100% ownership of those cash flows. As I said at the beginning of this year, look, the strategy right now for us is to build cash on the balance sheet to prepare for the AWS-3 auction that\u2019s coming in November and that\u2019s the strategic initiative we had moving into this year. So we have gross debt at about the same level. Now, that\u2019s been came down from a high of $114 billion when we closed the Vodafone transaction, that\u2019s at $110 billion. But you see us accumulating that cash on the balance sheet to prepare for the auction. As far as the overall refinancing of long-term debt here, you\u2019ve seen us to be very proactive in a marketplace taking the opportunity of the low interest rate market, repositioning the debt that we borrowed at the close and repositioning our towers. So we\u2019re strategically trying to push up the long-term debt longer at a more fixed lower rate than we had. And we will continue to work those towers into the future. I really won\u2019t talk about our future plans at this point. It would be inappropriate to do that. As far as bonus depreciation goes, look, I\u2019m optimistic but I\u2019m not because here we sit in July, there\u2019s not much activity moving around us. There\u2019s many things that the government has to deal with including the highway build that\u2019s pertinent to us because of pensions moving that\u2019s included in that bill. There\u2019s also the Internet Freedom Act that has to get passed or else consumers are going to be detrimented here at the end of this year. And then of course, we have the overall tax reform in bonus depreciation. So look, I think, we\u2019ll have to wait to see, but as the year runs out, bonus depreciation becomes less and less impactful. So we\u2019re hopeful that the government will do the right thing here to stimulate the economy and investment around this but it\u2019s hard for me to predict that. So at this point, we\u2019re not counting on any decrease in our federal tax payments because of bonus depreciation. And as I said at the beginning of the year, this was about $1 billion of incremental tax impact to us by not having that Bonus Depreciation. As far as dividend policy goes, look, I think we\u2019ve both Lowell and I have reiterate that we understand the dividend policy is important. Our Board of Directors understand the dividend policy is important but it is a Board of Director decision, so I can\u2019t sit here today and tell you what that policy will be. But we do understand it\u2019s important and I think we\u2019ve reflected our board has been very aggressive in our dividend policy over the last seven years and so I think that should set the stage for the future.\nMichael Stefanski: David, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden \u2013 Bank of America: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, two if I could. Just first, Fran, obviously there\u2019s a lot of focus on wireless service margin this quarter, from the comment of last quarter that there was next vacation that we\u2019re going to get a huge increase in the installment payment plan take rate. There was an equivalent expectation that we\u2019re going to get a lot of upfront revenue recognition and that would have helped the margins a lot. But that obviously didn\u2019t really take place. At 18% take rate, that probably gave you a couple of hundred million relative to street expectations. You said that the installment payment plan impact was about the same at this quarter as last quarter, but it was net of the service price discounts. Could you parse that out between the impact that you took from a cash perspective of giving lower prices versus the revenue benefit non-cash that you got from the upfront accounting related issues that going to the installment payment plan? And I guess, the second question would be more of a strategic one. I know you guys have been working on video and pushing video through the wireless network from a TV anywhere perspective buying content partnering people through the last couple of years. Could you talked a little bit about what the talk now of consolidation of the content environment, how your strategy is unfolding, how you\u2019re working to try to bring video content into the wireless environment so you can monetize it over to 4G network? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Good. Thanks, David. So as long \u2013 look, on the service margin, I think here\u2019s the way I would answer this is that we produced a 50.3% margin on extremely high volume growth under a subsidy model and I think that\u2019s the key for this quarter. So we really didn\u2019t get much benefit from the Edge program because the take rate was only 18%. We said that the billings around Edge were $180 million, so you can do the backwards math there. But if you look at the actual EBITDA impact of Edge I said was similar to the first quarter. As far as the pricing refresh that we did in the first quarter to respond to the competitive environment, again, there is some impact there from dilution on customers that are moving and that we are as I said addressing from a churn perspective. But this is all good for us because we maintain those customers on an appropriate plan. They stay with Verizon Wireless. They\u2019re adding tablets. They\u2019re increasing their ARPU again. So the way I would venture to say on this one without getting to too much math on service revenue pricing and so forth, if you take the $180 million and add that to the ARPA, I think you\u2019d come out with a number that\u2019s significantly higher than the 4.7% from a recurring revenue standpoint if you will. So I think from a 50.3% quarter based on the growth that we had on a subsidy model, I think it\u2019s just an outstanding quarter for us from an overall profitability on Verizon Wireless. So I\u2019ll stand on that one and leave it at that. As far as content goes, look, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated through our NFL agreement, some of our IndyCar agreement and some other agreements that we have around some sporting networks, that we will continue to search for those opportunities that make content available to our wireless customers without a linear TV or satellite TV subscription. And I think that\u2019s important for the wireless user as we see more and more of the younger generation are cutting the quarter in their home and want their content either via or the internet or wireless, that\u2019s the strategy that we hold. If you\u2019re asking me, do we need to own the content? We continue to position ourselves but we believe we do not need to own content to be successful in this ecosystem, but we just need to get the rights for that content. We understand that content providers want to be paid for those rights and as long as that\u2019s a worker commercial model for us then we will continue on that strategy. I\u2019d also highlight that one of the big things here that\u2019s coming to market is of course Multicast which will really enhance the experience for our customers around watching video and also extremely efficient for the wireless industry to provide that video through their network without consuming a lot of spectrum and a lot of capacity. So we will start to embed chips in our handsets here, the back half for this year. The network will be ready by the end of the third quarter to actually launch Multicast. We won\u2019t go commercial with that until \u201815, but the network will be ready and it\u2019s a matter of getting the handsets in customers\u2019 hands and then obviously getting the content which we demonstrated with the Super Bowl this past January. For those types of the events that we think will be very, very really consumed by the consumer on real time live type events. So more to come around the whole video strategy of Wireless but I think the breakthrough point here will be once Multicast technology is up and running and launched.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, David, we\u2019ll take the next question now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Great, thanks, guys. Fran, can you give us a sense of what percentage of your postpaid base takes a 10 gigabyte or larger bucket and maybe how that\u2019s changed over time? Just trying to get a sense of the up strategy some more tablets into the base. And then on the Wireline side, that\u2019s more of the follow up. You saw a 100 basis points year-over-year improvement in margins but you didn\u2019t talk about somewhat that one time that drove the revenue, did that also affect the margins or is this 100 basis point improvement sort of a good run rate for what you can expect for the second half of the year? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, John. So first, on the 10 gigabit plan, we don\u2019t disclose where our customers sit within the bands. But what I will tell you is it that we have quarter-to-quarter over the last three quarters seen an increased in the amount of customers taking the 10 gigabit plan and pricing up. So we watched on a quarterly basis the number of customers that buy down in data bundles and buy up in data bundles and that over the last several quarters we\u2019ve had a significant net positive in buying up in data bundles. So from that perspective the takeaway will be is that we continue to see an increase in customers buying up in their data bundles and that includes the 10 gigabit plan. As far as the Wireline margin, look, we\u2019ve said from the beginning of this year, Lowell and I were very opportunistic on increasing the Wireline margin. Now some of this is seasonality. Second quarter is always good. Third quarter tends to have some seasonality into it. But look, overall I think you should see that we are moving the Wireline business in the right direction from a profitability standpoint. And there are a lot of things that we still need to work on obviously. As I\u2019ve said FiOS is the big driver on the top line, copper migration continues to be an important strategic initiative for us. But I don\u2019t want to down plate the fact that our VLSS, we\u2019ve been at this for two years and we\u2019re now starting to see the benefits of a lot of these projects around efficiencies and cost cutting starting to come through. So again, that is part of this, you should see us improve our productivity especially around the new Quantum TV where we can put a media server into the home and start to get some real efficiencies in the install process and we think that will happen entering in 2015. So again, I think that\u2019s part of it. The other thing too is this that we can\u2019t lose side of the fact that we continue to look at this portfolio and as I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks we did divest of a branch of our public sector business which was about $600 million of revenue that last year. You will see the impact of that going into the third quarter. So we will lose that revenue in third quarter, so that\u2019s going to show up in our public sector business. But from an overall margin standpoint, that\u2019s going to help the profitability of this company. And this is again looking at non-strategic businesses that are what I would say is not our niche in the business and we need to divest to them. And Lowell and I continue to look at things that we can divest of that are best for overall shareholder value. And we will continue with that.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS: Great, thanks, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nFran Shammo: Mike, are you on mute?\nMike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC: Can you hear me?\nFran Shammo: Yes, now I can. Go ahead.\nMike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC: Sorry about that. Yes, Fran, just thinking about the net add numbers, the 2.3 million 4G LTE postpaid versus the 1.4 overall. Can you just sort of map us through that, what you\u2019re saying as far basic and features phone sub losses or migration? You talked about migrations, but you\u2019re saying is more pressure standpoint from the competitors. And then secondly on FiOS and these targeted MDUs more recently, what you\u2019re saying with their expected changing video behaviors among that youth demographic, maybe just a comment on what kind of returns you guys get on a broadband only sub? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Okay, let me start with the MDU side. So from an MDU perspective, look, these continues to be one of our strong penetration gains. And as I\u2019ve said before, New York City is still our lowest penetrated market but it is our highest year-over-year gain. And a lot of this has to do with MDUs. But this is a \u2013 it\u2019s a challenging business because the average tenant of an MDU in New York, I think the last time I looked was eight months. So these units change and of course the strategy, part of the strategy is to accumulate the new residence coming in to continue to use the FiOS demand. But obviously within this younger generation, a year ago, we tested the ability to have them select whether they wanted large TV bundles and lower Internet speeds or high Internet speeds and lower TV bundles. And what we saw is the majority of this said does this segment selected the highest speed that they could get and didn\u2019t really care about how many TV stations they got because most of them are consuming their video via Internet. Again, this is just another position for us of why we\u2019ve gone the symmetry within our broadband offers. We just launched that this week, so you will see that heading the consumer market which symmetry on all of our broadband offers. We launched it six months ago in our small business segment, so this is again another strategy which we think is important for that generation who really wants the highest speed that they can get and they want the symmetry in that speed. So that will continue to be an overall concentration for us. As far as the handsets and all, look, I think that you can probably do the backwards map here and we said that we added 2.3 million 4G, LTE phones overall. We\u2019ve said that we had million 4G smartphones net adds for the quarter. So with the 304,000 net number the majority of those losses were basic phones and then the rest were made with 3G. So again, you can see that the basic phone category or I would consider this to lower end phone category continues to be the category that we lose but I will say that we made substantial improvement from what we saw on the first quarter with all the pricing actions, the retention tools that we put in place and some of the new pricing tools that we put in place. Overall, I think we significantly improved and that came through on the operating results of Verizon Wireless.\nMike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC: Hey, Fran, just a quicky on the EIP, could you just give us a sense for how that paced through the quarter? Was it accelerating throughout? And then what should we think about for the full year on the EIP uptake? What\u2019s your expectation?\nFran Shammo: I think I would put it this way. What I saw was in our store channel, it was pretty much relatively flat. The increase came through the indirect channel when we launched that. Right now I would say that I think one important piece of information here as well is that on the front line our sales representatives make the same compensation whether they sell on Edge plan or a legacy subsidy model. There was no difference in their compensations. So again, this comes down to the important ingredient that this is truly a customer choice. The rep shows them both models and the customer chooses. So as far as going forward, look, I think that we are on pace to be somewhere between this 18% to 20% but again, when you think about all of the new phones that are coming in the back half of the year through the indirect channel, this could escalate a bit on us. The competitive environment has a lot to do with this. But right now under current course and current environment, I think that the 18% to 20% is really where we sit.\nMike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC: Great, thanks Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Smithen on Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie: Thanks. With Edge adoption at just 18%, the fall in year-over-year seems to imply a repricing of non-Edge base. I think you said you had some churn mitigation promotions in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about that and also where do you expect year-over-year ARPA stabilize?\nFran Shammo: Yes. So I think Kevin as I\u2019ve said at the beginning, I think you have to do a little of backwards math here because the Edge plan if you take that 180 million billing number that I gave you and you look at ARPA, I think what you\u2019ll see is if you calculate back in the returning monthly and equipment revenue which in essence would have been service revenue, I think your percentage increase would be relatively flat with the first quarter and some past quarters. So, again I think that the service revenue impact and the ARPA impact is really Edge-related. Now, there is some of course service pricing discounts in there and we are moving as we said proactively some of our customers who are out of contract and we think that they have a high propensity to churn. We are proactively moving them to the Edge pricing. But we\u2019re doing this very, very systematically. And so there will be a little bit of pressure there, but I think if you do that backwards math that I gave you, I think you\u2019ll get to the true numbers of what the ARPA growth would have been with this recurring equipment revenue in it.\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie: And how should we think about the AWS refinancing? Will this be an additional capital raise or funded out of cash on-hand and how should we think about your sort of leverage targets with the spectrum auction? And it sounds like you want to be very aggressive with that.\nFran Shammo: Well I think the way you want to think about this is it is an auction. So I\u2019m not going to talk about how we think we\u2019re going to pay for that auction because I\u2019m not going to give anybody information of how much I\u2019m willing to spend for the auction. So I think we\u2019ll just wait there. As I said, the strategy is to build cash, prepare for the auction and we\u2019ll execute accordingly. So more to come on that in the latter back of the year.\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie: Thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.\nJonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners: Oh, great, thanks. Two if I may. First, just in terms of the outlook on the top line for the remainder of the year and you guys have had a very strong first half of the year up almost 6% revenue growth year-over-year in the second quarter. And the outlook for the year is only about 4%. I\u2019m wondering if that is just conservative stance at this point in the year or if there\u2019s something that we should look out for in particular as we examine our back half for the year projections. And then yet another question around EIP. I\u2019m just wondering if we could get a census to where the receivable currently stood or maybe the change in receivable over quarter-over-quarter. Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So on the 4%, look, being the CFO, we generally are conservative. So I\u2019ll stick to the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year which was top line growth of 4% plus, so I\u2019ll stick to that. As far as the balance sheet goes, if you look at our balance sheet, the change in the AR is directly related to the Edge program, so you can look at that change and pretty much come to your answer.\nJonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners: Thank you for taking the questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, last question?\nOperator: Your last question today will come from Jennifer Fritzsche from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nJennifer Fritzsche \u2013 Wells Fargo: Great, thank you for taking the question. Fran, you have mentioned a lot about the AWS-3 auction. I know there\u2019s a lot of complications and a lot of blurriness around it. But I\u2019ve not heard you talk openly about the broadcast or incentive auction. Your closest peer obviously made a big monetary number, put a monetary number with that. And I just was wondering your current thought as you stand here today.\nFran Shammo: Yes. So thanks, Jennifer. So look \u2013 I mean we are focused on AWS-3 auction and the reason we\u2019re focused on that is it will start November 13th, deposits will be required. We actually know exactly what the rules are. The procedures for that auction will be announced sometime in the next coming weeks. So that\u2019s really the focal point for us. As far as the broadcast spectrum goes, look, currently there are no final adoptive rules on this. So it\u2019s hard for us to sit here and make a comment on something that has not been finalized. So I think that would be premature for us. I know what others have done, but look we are focused on AWS. We\u2019ll get through that. We\u2019ll see what the broadcast spectrum final rules are and then you\u2019ll hear more from us when that happens. But at this point, I\u2019m not going to make anymore comments around the broadcast.\nMichael Stefanski: That\u2019s all time we have for questions for today. But before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Mike. Just a couple of quick closing comments. So look we had an extremely strong first half of 2014 in terms of our buy-in growth and financial performance. Importantly, we closed the Vodafone transaction and now have sole ownership of the Wireless asset. To the first half of this year, we have exceeded our revenue growth targets and delivered strong earnings growth. We have great momentum heading into the second half and we are competing well in all of our key strategic areas. Our cash generation is very strong and we have great confidence in our ability to execute on our strategy and grow this business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future. We are excited about our growth opportunities and we will continue to invest, innovate and deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. Thank you so much for joining us today and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski:  Thanks David. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran takes you through the details of our quarterly performance, I would like to cover a few details about our reported results. For this discussion, let\u2019s turn to Slide 3. For the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.15 per share on a GAAP basis. Our reported results reflect a partial quarter with 55% ownership of Verizon Wireless in just over five weeks to full ownership. Since this transaction to acquire Vodafone\u2019s stake closed on February 21. The weighted average common shares outstanding for the first quarter were 3,430 million. Given the issuance of 1,275 million new shares of Verizon as part of the deal consideration. The timing of the closing had no effect on our consolidated income statement for Wireless segment above the operating income line since we\u2019ve always had operating control of Verizon Wireless. All of the post-closing effects of full ownership are below the operating income line. Our reported first quarter EPS of $1.15 includes several non-operational items that I would like to review. The first item is a gain on the sale of our minority interest in Vodafone Omnitel. This resulted in a one-time after-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion or $0.55 per share. This is a non-cash item as it was part of the transaction consideration. The next item is a non-operational charge related to debt redemption. During the first quarter, we announced a partial make whole redemption and a cash tender offer for various notes with maturities over the next five years and coupons of 5.5% entire. We regained $5.4 billion of notes through the make whole redemption and tender offer. The associated net pretax costs were $923 million. After tax this resulted in a charge of $575 million or $0.17 per share. We also incurred interest in financing costs related to the wireless transaction. As we did in the third and fourth quarters, we are excluding these charges from adjusted results for the period January 1 through the February 21 closing. These transaction costs total $411 million on a pretax basis resulting in an after tax charge of $260 million or $0.08 per share. Excluding the effect of these three non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.84 for the first quarter compared with $0.68 a year ago or growth of 2013.5%. Adjusted EPS of $0.84 reflects 55% ownership of Verizon Wireless for the period January 1 through February 21 and full ownership for the remainder of the quarter. Of course, future quarters will include a 100% of the Wireless net income and access to all the Wireless cash flows. For an illustrated non-GAAP view of adjusted earnings, assuming full ownership of Verizon Wireless for the entire first quarter, let\u2019s take a look at Slide 4. The elements for this illustrated view are based on the adjustments in the pro forma financial statements filed with the SEC for the periods ending September 30 and December 31 2013. We also review these transaction effects on February 24 call when we provided some guidance for items below operating income. Adjusted EPS of $0.84 would have been $0.91 per share assuming 100% ownership of Wireless for the full quarter. Again, on a non-GAAP illustrated basis. The adjustments required to demonstrate this are relatively straightforward. The 45% of Wireless net income attributable to Vodafone for the period January 1 to February 21 totaled $1.2 billion and would be added to adjusted earnings. The transaction related cost for the same time period would be subtracted. Accounting for these effects, adjusted earnings would be $3.8 billion with an effective tax rate of about 35%. The diluted shares outstanding that we use for this illustrated EPS calculation were 4,149 million shares, which assumes the newly issued shares were outstanding for the entire quarter. In summary, the impact of having a 100% ownership of Wireless for only part of the first quarter was worth $0.07 of earnings per share. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo:  Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone. As I stated on our last few conference calls, we have great confidence in our ability to generate strong financial performance in 2014. Over the years, our steady and consistent investments in networks and platforms have supported innovative products and services and fueled our growth. Our wireless and wireline networks will continue to be the hallmark of our brands and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage. Now that the Wireless transaction is behind us, we have the immediate financial benefit of earnings accretion from the deal and full access to the very significant cash flows of Verizon Wireless. As we have previously stated, we are targeting 4% consolidated top-line growth in 2014 with an expansion of our consolidated EBITDA margin. The ingredients for success are unchanged, solid operational execution and a disciplined focus on meeting our financial objectives and creating value for our shareholders. With an eventful first quarter behind us, I\u2019d say we are off to a strong start. We maintained our growth momentum and delivered excellent top-line and bottom-line results. While the timing of the Wireless transaction closing caused some reporting complexity, our $0.84 adjusted earnings per share represent a growth of 23.5% and would be even greater if we assume full ownership of Wireless for the entire quarter. We have consistently delivered high quality earnings growth with double-digit increases in reported and adjusted earnings per share in eight of the last nine quarters. Our cash flow generation in the quarter was also impressive and we continue to invest in our networks and platforms. Our Wireless results were very good with service revenue growth of 7.5% and a service EBITDA margin of 52.1%, an expansion of a 170 basis points. In FiOS, our positive revenue growth trends and scale drove a 6.2% increase in consumer revenue. Total wireline operating revenues declined 0.4% in the quarter which is our best result in nearly three years. In terms of profitability, our EBITDA margin was 22.3%, up 90 basis points. Now, let\u2019s get into our first quarter performance in more detail starting with consolidated results on Slide 6. Total operating revenues grew 4.8% in the first quarter continuing our consistent top-line growth trend and was our highest growth rate in the past five quarters. Top-line growth was once again driven by Wireless and FiOS. In terms of new revenue streams, machine-to-machine and telematics were still relatively small are beginning to emerge and make positive contributions with revenue growth in excess of 40%. Our focus on operating efficiency and cost controls is enabling our ability to compete effectively and drive consistent profitable growth. In the first quarter, consolidated operating expenses grew 2%. Operating income growth was 15.1%. We have posted double-digit growth in operating income in eight of the last nine quarters. Consolidated EBITDA grew 9.3% while our EBITDA margin expanded by 160 basis points to 36.7%. Let\u2019s take a look at cash flow results next on Slide 7. When looking at our cash flows, it is important to keep in mind that post transaction, we have immediate access to the full Verizon Wireless cash flows. And apart from a contractual tax distribution in the second quarter for the stub period, we will no longer be making any cash distributions to Vodafone. As a result, the amount of cash available to us will be significantly greater this year. This is true for the simple reason that under the partnership structure, 45% of excess cash at Wireless would at some point be distributed to Vodafone. As we discussed on our February 24 call, there will be some lack of comparability between current and prior periods in the statement of cash flows. In 2014, the cash flows from operations line will include higher cash payments for interest and taxes. The cash flows from financing section will have lower cash distributions to Vodafone and higher overall dividend payments to our shareholders due to the increase in shares outstanding. In the first quarter, cash flows from operations were $7.1 billion, which included an incremental $1.3 billion of cash interest payments and $200 million of pension funding that we did not had in the first quarter of 2013. In spite of these additional uses of cash and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $3 billion in the quarter. For illustrative purposes, free cash flow available to Verizon in the first quarter was more than $1 billion higher than a year ago assuming that 45% of the free cash flow at Wireless would have been distributed to Vodafone. Again, the point here is more free cash flow available at the corporate level than prior to the transaction even after higher interest payments and cash taxes. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $4.2 billion, up $548 million with all the increase in Wireless. With our 4G LTE coverage build complete, Wireless spending is now focused on adding capacity intensity to our existing coverage and utilizing our AWS spectrum to further optimize the network. As we have previously stated, our estimate for total capital spending in 2014 will be in the range of $65 billion to $70 billion. In addition to the transaction closing, we had a large amount of financing activities in the quarter. At closing, our gross debt was approximately $114 billion. Since then, we announced the make whole redemption and a tender offer did some debt restructuring and had $2.5 billion of notes mature. We ended the quarter with gross debt of just under $110 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. Our balance sheet remains strong and we have the financial flexibility needed to grow the business. Our priorities for cash utilization are unchanged. We will continue to invest in our networks, acquire Spectrum and return to our pre-transaction credit ratings profile within four to five years. We do not need to execute any major acquisitions to drive our business model. We understand the importance of our dividends and our board of directors has shown its support by approving dividend increases in each of the last seven years. In terms of acquiring new spectrum, we will continue to be opportunistic. Earlier this month, we signed agreements to acquire the wireless licenses of Cincinnati Bell along with some power lease. We will continue to look at the secondary markets and we will consider the opportunities in the upcoming FCC auctions. Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. We will continue to build and expand our network advantage in 4G LTE. Our focus is on deploying capital to add density to our network and deliver new services such as VoLTE and multicasting to enrich our customers\u2019 wireless experience. Regardless of what others claim, recent national surveys from widely recognized third-party organizations confirm our leadership. Our own dry testing which we have been doing for years shows that we consistently deliver the best customer experience market-by-market and day-by-day across the United States. Total Wireless revenues grew to $20.9 billion, up 6.9% driven by strong service revenue growth of 7.5%. We generated $9.4 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 11.3%. Our Service EBITDA margin in the quarter was 52.1%. There has certainly been a lot of investor attention centered on the effects of equipment monthly payment plan options for customers. Let me be very clear and provide the financial impacts of our Verizon EDGE plans for the first quarter. As you would expect, the number of customer activations on EDGE increased sequentially and is also running ahead of our expectations. The estimated EBITDA benefit from the accounting treatment under these plans was worth about $165 million, which equates to less than 2% of total EBITDA in the quarter. The benefit to our service EBITDA margin was approximately 90 basis points. While EDGE had a favorable effect on profitability, our results demonstrate that we delivered EBITDA growth and margin expansion over and above the benefits of equipment monthly payment plans. Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 9. Service revenue in the first quarter was driven by 4G smartphone adoption and tablet growth and increasing data usage. In mid of February, we introduced our More Everything plan which provides more value through simplified data allowances and more choice for customers. In addition, we revised our monthly pricing under Verizon EDGE for customers who buy their devices on installment payments. Last week, we extended this reduced monthly pricing to customers who are currently out of contract. These pricing actions improve the customer value proposition and will help drive further penetration of 4G smartphones and tablets and stimulate usage on our very cost-effective 4G LTE network. Retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 6.3% to nearly $160 per month in the first quarter. The lower monthly pricing under the EDGE plans had a minimal impact on ARPA this quarter. Going forward, continued EDGE adoption will likely have a greater impact on ARPA due to the shift from service to equipment revenue. Our reduced monthly pricing for out of contract customers will also affect the rate of service revenue growth over time. We ended the quarter with 35.1 million postpaid accounts and connections per account grew to 2.77 up 3.7% from a year ago. More Everything plan adoption continues and we ended the quarter with 50% of postpaid accounts on these shared data plans. The majority of these accounts are in data tiers of 4 gigabytes or higher and usage continues to drive migration to the higher data tier. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 10. In the first quarter, postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million, up 4.1%, about 56% of our gross adds were smartphones and 33% were tablets and other internet devices. Retail postpaid churn was 1.07%, up six basis points year-over-year. On a net basis, we added 549,000 new retail connections in the first quarter. Postpaid net adds were 539,000 and prepaid were 10,000. At the end of March, we had 103.3 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base reached 97.3 million and prepaid totaled just over 6 million. The first quarter postpaid add mix included 866,000 4G smartphones and a record 634,000 tablets. We also had 56,000 other connected device adds primarily home phone connects. These additions were offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones resulting in a negative total phone net adds. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.5% in the quarter; more than 88% of these upgrades were smartphones. Consistent with our plan to drive smartphone penetration and 4G adoption, about 1.5 million or 27% of our smartphone upgrades were from basic phones. More than 50% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve. Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and take a look at device sales and our progress on 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations which include both gross adds and upgrades totaled 9.9 million, an increase of 2%. We have 7.6 million smartphone activations, of which nearly 90% were 4G. Smartphone penetration increased to 72% of our total phones. We ended the quarter with 61.3 million smartphones and about 64% of those were 4G. So we still have about 22 million 3G smartphones and a little more than 23 million basic phones in our base which provides us with a good opportunity to move customers upgrade 4G smartphones. We had our best tablet quarter ever, activating 814,000 postpaid tablets, virtually all of which were 4G. This is more than double the amount from the first quarter last year and about 3% more than the fourth quarter. Our postpaid tablet base now stands at 4.3 million, so again, we have a great opportunity to expand this category and generate growth in 2014 and beyond. Overall, 4G device penetration continues to steadily increase. At the end of the first quarter, 49% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 28% a year ago. Data and video usage on our network continues to rise; currently about 73% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. We will continue to focus on expanding our network advantage, investing to add density and to optimize our 4G LTE network ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability they expect from our network. Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets\u2019 revenue performance on Slide 12. In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. For the last seven quarters, Consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the first quarter, Consumer revenues were up 6.2% mass markets which include small business grew 4.9%. FiOS now represents about 74% of Consumer revenue and we are sustaining strong double-digit growth. In the first quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 14.6% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and quantum penetration. About 51% of our FiOS internet customers subscribe to Quantum which speeds ranging from 50 megabits to 500 megabits per second. We continue to focus on adding quality customers and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are very competitive markets and we continue to be disciplined in rational in our approach to customer acquisitions. In Broadband, we added 98,000 new FiOS internet customers in the first quarter and now have 6.2 million subscribers representing just under 40% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers in the quarter were a positive 16,000. In FiOS video, we added 57,000 new subscribers in the quarter. Total FiOS video customers reached 5.3 million representing 35% penetration. We also continue to make steady progress with fiber migration. During the quarter, we converted about 78,000 customers from copper to superior fiber technology. This network initiative is important as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technologies. We\u2019ve begun to see the benefits from a maintenance perspective in what was one of the worst winters in recent memory in the Northeast. Aside from maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services which will result in additional recurring revenues. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 13 and review our overall Wireline segment revenue and profitability. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $164 million or 4.4%. Revenue declines in Legacy Transport Services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer applications which are smaller in scale. Strategic Services which include Private IP, Ethernet, Datacenter, Cloud, Security and Managed Services, grew 1.8%. This category includes some revenue from the public sector where we continue to experience revenue pressure. In general, Enterprise customers continue to be more focused on improving their cost structure rather than investing for growth which creates top-line pressure for us. In our Global Wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $108 million or 6.4%. While we had healthy demand in Ethernet services in the quarter, it was not enough to offset the impact of technology migration, price compression and other secular challenges. From an overall Wireline perspective, total operating revenues were down 0.4%, EBITDA was $2.2 billion, up 3.4% resulting in an EBITDA margin of 22.3% for the quarter. Our strategic investments in network technology enable us to deliver reliable and high quality services and solutions to consumers, small businesses and enterprise customers. As we scale these key products and services, they will improve our overall revenue mix and drive further operating efficiency. We are focused on network operating efficiency through improvements in service provisioning and dispatch and repair rates. We remain confident in our ability to increase Wireline EBITDA and expand the margin in 2014. Our financial performance in the first quarter was a good start. Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. We are off to a strong start with a 4.8% increase in consolidated revenues and a 160 basis points EBITDA margin expansion. We continue to post high-quality double-digit adjusted earnings growth and have a strong cash position with full access to growing wireless cash flow. We are on track to achieve our revenue growth, margin expansion and capital spending targets for the year. We have good momentum in Wireless and expect to build on that strength driving further penetration of devices, and extending our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets, and continue to differentiate ourselves with the superior broadband products and are recently introduced FiOS Quantum TV service. In the Enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms, demonstrating that we have the unique set of capabilities to provide customer solution. We remain focused on cost structure improvements, to drive productivity and operating efficiencies throughout the entire business utilizing our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principles. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski:  Thank you, Fran. David, we are now ready to take the questions.\nOperator:  Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan:  Hey guys, thanks. So I guess, if we \u2013 just talk about subscribers on both sides, churn up in Wireless leading to some handset share losses this quarter and FiOS softer, too. You seem to be responding to T somewhat with the Edge price cuts recently and allowing people to trade down. How should we think about the impact to ARPA in 2Q and beyond from these trade-down effects? And then what about responding to cable on the FiOS side? Are you happy with the revenue ramp due to rate increases or do you try harder on subs as we go forward, too? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Hi, good morning, Phil. So, look, I think that, let\u2019s talk about the subs and the churn and then we can talk about the EDGE pricing. So, first off, I think if you put this quarter in perspective, coming into this quarter from the fourth quarter on the end of the first quarter call here or the fourth quarter, we talked about how we would take a very rational disciplined approach in responding to the competitive marketplace. And that\u2019s what you saw us do through the quarter. Now having done that, through January and February we saw a lot of pressure around our basic phone customer base which is why we launched our low-end 4G price point on More Everything to give those basic customers a chance and a view into getting over to a smartphone on our 4G network and we saw the improvements through the month of March. In addition, if you look at our tablet sales, we said coming into this year, that tablet would be a major growth trajectory for the entire industry and I think that\u2019s what you are seeing. You are going to see that this is a very underpenetrated marketplace and the more we drive tablets into our 4G network, the more revenue stimulation we create. So we had one of the best tablet quarters ever even without the Christmas season from the fourth quarter. So, when you look at the churn, the churn was definitely impacted via the basic phone customer base. So, we actually had one of the best quarters ever adding 866,000 4G smartphones to our base and then another 634 tablets. So the net effect of the loss was mainly within the basic phone base and some 3G smartphone customers which led us to then refresh our shared pricing to More Everything and then we also had to do some response to some of the EDGE pricing that the competitive marketplace offered in order for us to be competitive within those high-end data plans. However, I think it\u2019s also important to say that these installment plans or EDGE plan is a very profitable plan to us. So as we manage the business through prepaid reseller, postpaid subscribers whether they go on a subsidy model or on an installment sale model, these are all accretive to the business and very profitable plans. So, if you look at the ARPA, obviously ARPA since it does not include equipment revenue, the increase in the take rate of EDGE will definitely have an impact on that metric and do I expect the EDGE take rate to increase? Yes, because, if you look at the first quarter, most of the EDGE products were sold through our direct channel and we will be expanding that to the indirect channels coming here at the very end of the first quarter, mainly in the second quarter. So the EDGE take rate will increase, which will have an impact on service revenues and the ARPA metric. So, we will have to think about that going into the second quarter that's how report that. But again I feel very confident in coming out of the first quarter with 7.5% of service revenue growth and the ARPA growth. Now, as far as the competitive pressures and some of the other moves we\u2019ve made, look, I mean, this goes back to when we first went to shared pricing, we said that it would be dilutive in the short-term but it would drive usage on our network and by moving to EDGE and out of contracts and it\u2019s a very small base of customers because you have to be on More Everything and include it in the base. But obviously in the short-term, this could create some revenue pressure for us, but again it\u2019s moving these customers to higher daily usage plans which drive more usage which in essence drives more revenue. So the guidance we have given you, I stand firm on, because we\u2019ve considered all of this into our forecast. So, I don\u2019t really anticipate changing any of that at this point in time. If I move over to the cable environment with FiOS and the net add, there were two really main things here that happened. First off, we did a price increase in the fourth quarter and every time we do a price increase, we always see some pressure in the churn in the following quarter. But also we had probably one of the worst winters on record here and people did not want us in their houses to install FiOS. But I think a couple of things to point out. One is the competitive pressure from cable did increased in the first quarter. \\We did not respond immediately because of the environment that we were dealing in weather. So we waited, we became more aggressive in March and I would tell you that exiting the quarter, our pipeline has grown and I have a viewpoint that the second quarter will be back on track from a net add perspective. So, Phil, I\u2019ll leave it at that and hopefully that answers your question.\nPhil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan:  That helps. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, David, let\u2019s take the next question please.\nOperator:  And your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley:  Great, thanks a lot. Good morning, Fran. Just to quickly follow-up on EDGE, have you had any change in your view about the \u2013 kind of the sell activity of the EDGE product? It seems like T-Mobile and AT&T are pushing these fairly broadly, and in the past you have sort of said you want to reserve this for your best customers. Any change there? And then perhaps you could touch a bit more on the network. Where are you on the AWS rollout and have you solved all the congestion problems you were talking about a couple of quarters ago? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Simon. So, first on EDGE, look, this is a customer choice. This is not what I want. It really comes into our customer choices and again, we are going to allow our customers to choose the right plan for them and if you look at the economics, it depends on what phone choose. So, if you decide to take a free iPhone that\u2019s out in the marketplace today, you may be better off going on the subsidy plan for two years end up paying less over time than the installment plan. If you decide to take a very high-end handset, then you may benefit by going to the installment sale. So, I think it\u2019s a personal choice. It also comes down to when do you think you are going to upgrade. If you are a customer that wants to hold your phone on for a two-year period of time or longer, it depends what plan you may choose. If you decide, you want to upgrade every year, then obviously the installment plan is the plan that you have to select. So, this comes down to personal choice and again our sales forces is not compensated to drive traffic to any one sort of plan. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about customer satisfaction and treating our customers and the choices that they want. So, again, its \u2013 the way I look at this is, as we manage the business, these plans are all profitable plans to us. So it comes down to customer choice. On the network side of the house, I think that, in my script, I was pretty deliberate on making some statements there about some third-party studies that were done in the first quarter and I think that speaks to itself as to where we are with our network. We are through the congestion. The network performance is delivering what we expected to and as you see that in our CapEx spending, we are going to be more leveled this year. If you know historically, we\u2019ve always had more of a ramp from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. We will be more leveled with that. So we are really concentrating on the density and the diversification of the 4G network, especially in the major cities and that\u2019s where we have deployed AWS and we will continue to deploy AWS throughout the year more into the smaller cities and into the rural markets, but right now the concentration is in the major cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago et cetera. So, Simon, that handles the question. Thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: David, we can take the next question now.\nOperator:  The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch:  Thanks guys, thanks for taking the questions. So, Fran, I apologize \u2013 I got \u2013 I have to ask one more on EDGE, too, which is that one of the things we saw coming out of the AT&T result was that there is really two parts to these installment plans. One is the mechanical part of changing the accounting where you take some of the service revenue and you put it into equipment revenue and that's the relatively easy part. Another part of the puzzle thought was that, if AT&T was very aggressive at pushing this pricing out to people even if they didn't take the installment payment plan because they felt like it was an immunization tool against incremental competition. So, could you kind of share with us kind of what we should be expecting from Verizon in terms of not just how the EDGE program is going to unfold, but how you're going to use the EDGE pricing as a competitive tool if it all? And then the second question, if I could was, on the Wireline margin side, a pretty strong margin, especially for 1Q, which historically has seen lots of headwinds for bonuses and FICA and other things. So I was wondering if you could kind of maybe give us a picture of whether we can use 1Q as a starting point for some of the Six-Sigma improvements and stuff that you are working on for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: All right, David. Good, thanks. So on the mechanical side, look, I mean, this is a fairly complex accounting for the EDGE pricing. But really there is two main components to this. First is you book up the receivable, you record the revenue over the time, but the amount of revenue that you record is based on the residual value that you assign and the liability that you set up for that telephone. And I would say that, our approach is going to be extremely conservative. So, we will probably be recording less revenue upfront under the installment sale, just so that we can get a feel for what the uncollectability is going to be over time. How much value these phones are going to be worth a year or two years out depending upon how many phones hit the market at the same place. We do think that there could be some saturation effect in the outer years. So we will take a very conservative approach here on the accounting. As far as the competitive environment, look, I am not going to speak for anybody else. I think, we\u2019ve shown, we will be rational and deliberate on how we respond to the marketplace. We are responding to our customers\u2019 requests. This recent move that we made related to allowing out of contract subscribers to move over to the EDGE pricing, I believe is a good move for us because again it treats our customers the way they want to be treated and it is a retention tool for us. So, it will help to deliver a lower churn metric in the future. And it\u2019s up to them whether they want to move, we are not going to deliberately move our customers, it will be totally to their choice. So, that's from a competitive environment. On the Wireline margin, I think that, at least everything Lowell and I had been talking about for the last two years is starting to finally come through on the metrics of Wireline. And just a couple of things, I think in the past, I\u2019d probably be sitting here asking for a test based on the Northeast corridor storms for the entire winter and one of the worst winters on record. And normally I\u2019d be sitting here talking about repair rates and how much expense we have to incur. And here we sit with all of the copper to fiber migrations that we have done over the last two years, we did another 70,000 plus this quarter. This is really starting to come in through the maintenance side, because fiber performance is much better during these weather conditions than copper performs. So, I think that all of the Verizon Lean Six-Sigma segments and I told you I was very confident coming into this year that we could improve the Wireline margin on a year-over-year basis and I hold to that confidence because of the things that I see between Verizon Lean Six-Sigma and also because of the copper to fiber migrations that we\u2019ve been able to form. In addition, of course, the good driver of revenue here is through our Quantum products and the uptake of our customers to the higher speeds and willing to pay more for those higher speeds and also the congestion in their houses because of the wireless devices they are running off of that Wi-Fi network really demand that fiber into the home that only FiOS can provide. So, I think everything together is driving this. We can talk about the Enterprise segment but as I said coming into the year, I think that best we will look at what we did last year and I think that\u2019s where the position will be as we will probably not see any improvement in Enterprise in 2014. Thanks, David.\nDavid Barden \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch:  Great, thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: David, let\u2019s take the next question.\nOperator:  And your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company:  Hey guys. Thanks. Fran, and just one thought on smartphones obviously becoming a bigger part of the base. Do you think smartphones are causing shorter handset lives, meaning as we look at adoption of EDGE or other EIP programs with smartphones needing to be upgraded more often. It's actually a better plan for the carriers and particularly for Verizon? And then secondly on Enterprise, if you could just comment, you made some comments regarding the decline in revenue there, maybe rank order what you are seeing there with respect to technology change, pricing and then demand? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Okay. So, on the \u2013 look, I think it\u2019s way too early to tell yet how the impact of the installment plans will react on the upgrade rate. I mean, we\u2019ve been at this for years and the upgrade rate is pretty steady. You will have fluctuations based on seasonality, but coming out of the first quarter, we really didn\u2019t see any change in that. But we probably really won\u2019t see the impact of early upgrades probably for another six to eight months. So, I think we are going to have to hold on what the expectation there is. But I think the other thing too though is that, just from an overall product set, you know, smartphones are, as I said coming into the quarter, are going to be a slower portion of the growth, I think for the entire industry as we go forward as the penetration grows. So we look to those other facets of the tablets and machine-to-machine and then if you look beyond that with VoLTE and multicast giving our customers even additional features that could potentially drive more usage on the network. So that\u2019s really what the future holds for us. The smartphone category, I do believe that upgrades may increase with EDGE, but again I think it\u2019s too early to tell. On the Enterprise side, look, I think what we continue to see here is that the United States is the highest corporate tax payer in the world and until we fix that situation, with all the discussions in Washington whether extenders will happen, won\u2019t happen, whether we\u2019ll get through tax reform or we won\u2019t get the tax reform, there is just too much uncertainty out there for enterprises to really lock down on where they are going in the future. So, I think, this is where we are playing right now. The public sector is still a major drag on our results and as you know, we include the public sector in our enterprise results. And that's also now impacting the strategic services because they are also starting to cut and move away from some of the more strategic products. So, I think, for this year, we just, we are satisfied with being flat with last year which is what I came into this year saying, and I think if we can resolve some of the issues and the uncertainties, and I think we are on a better path for enterprise. But right now, I think we are where we are.\nMike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company:  Okay, Fran, just on the pricing situation, is that a competitive issue or is it just technology change that lowers the price points for the product sets?\nFran Shammo: No, look, we are extremely competitive and have a great product set in our Enterprise space and obviously if we get into the details, I mean, if you look at security and look at our cloud services, they are growing. If you look at the huge Telematics platform, that\u2019s growing in the enterprise space, but then we have all this legacy voice and core and even within the IP products, you see the price compression happening on those products and each year it comes up for renewal you have a price compression. So, some of it is competitive, but we are in an extremely competitive environment. But look, I mean, people are just cutting enterprises are still focused on cost structure. They are not increasing their investments, they are increasing their spends. So that\u2019s where we sit.\nMike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company:  Thanks, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David, let\u2019s take the next question.\nOperator:  And your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research:  Hi, thanks, good morning. Fran, I was wondering if we could just take a step back in the Wireline business and just talk a little bit about the homes where you don't have FiOS. I think it\u2019s \u2013 and maybe you can give an update on a number, maybe roughly 8 million homes where you don't have plans to build FiOS. What you do in those markets to stay competitive and to try to improve the financial outlook or is that a source of even possible asset optimization at some point? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Sure, Mike. Thanks. This could be a record quarter since you didn\u2019t ask me about net debt on Wireless. So that\u2019s a good thing. But, look, on the FiOS and the copper houses, so, within the FiOS footprint as we said, we now have less than 1 million homes left that are on copper. So we will continue to migrate them. Outside of the FiOS footprint obviously, really we are taking two measures there. One is the Wireless portfolio and replacing some of that that old voice legacy copper voice with our LTE voice product that Wireless has been selling across the nation for almost two years now called Home Phone Connect. Within Wireline, they have a very similar product called VoiceLink which in essence is the same thing. So we will try to replace that copper legacy with those technologies. But look, I mean, outside, this is kind of where you say it\u2019s you have to nurture it and harvest what you have and we know that we are not going to be able to compete with speed in that environment and we will continue to do the best we can. Now, there will be certain areas, maybe another year or so, where we may look to extend the fiber a bit and include some small businesses which we compete extremely well in within the FiOS footprint and they are very profitable customers. But beyond that, Mike, I think we are in harvest mode and we will continue to do the best we can with the technologies we have as alternatives for our customers.\nMichael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research:  Thanks very much.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS:  Okay, thanks, guys. Fran, just quickly back to EDGE if we could, can you give us a sense of what the take rates you are seeing on smartphone sales these days? I think you said that it increased with the change in pricing, but if you could give us some color there that would be great. And then maybe the percentage of smartphones now that are on Edge pricing. And then maybe if possible, how that is going to evolve over time, especially now that you are moving some of the off-contract customers over to the new pricing?\nFran Shammo: Yes, thanks, John. So, as far as the take rate on EDGE, I would tell you that we were less than 15% in the first quarter from a take rate. I expect that to potentially double with the launch of this payment plan option within our indirect channel. I would also say that, it is going to become more and more difficult for us to separate out and give a normalized basis with and without EDGE. And the reason I say that is, as we start to launch this in our indirect channel, you are going to get into all kinds of confusion of how the commission works, who bought the phone, who is doing \u2013 we will do the installment on that, but we may not have actually sold the phone to the indirect. They may have bought it outright. So there is implications with how compensation will work. So although we gave you separate data here in the first quarter because it was easy, because it was just within our direct channel, I think that is going to become more complicated going out here. So, from a take rate perspective, it\u2019s hard for me to tell what the take rate will be. But I do believe it will probably double into the second quarter with the launch of our indirect channel John. So that's really all I can talk about on the EDGE. It\u2019s too early for us to tell what the rate will be.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS:  Okay, but in terms of the percentage of smartphones in the base that are on EDGE is it sort of mid single-digits at this point?\nFran Shammo: It\u2019s less than 2%.\nJohn Hodulik \u2013 UBS:  Less than 2%, got it, okay. All right, thanks, Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital:  Thank you very much. Fran, two areas I would like to touch on and this is sort of dovetailing on the prior question. You mentioned that EDGE penetration will increase, potentially doubling next quarter. I was wondering if you could give us how much of your earnings growth is attributed to sort of your expectations of rising penetration of EDGE? And then secondly, now that you've fully integrated the contribution of the Wireless business from Vodafone, how should we think about the quarterly progression of earnings now that there is a larger portion of your revenue is coming from one \u2013 what may argue \u2013 one could argue is a less fluctuating wireless business, which may now include less contribution to subsidy costs if EDGE penetration rises? Thanks a lot.\nFran Shammo: Sure, Amir. Thanks, so on the EDGE and the contribution, look, as I just said to the previous question it\u2019s going to be very, very hard for me to start to separate this given the indirect channel. Look, I think the guidance we have given, I stand behind the guidance that we\u2019ve given, we\u2019ll do our best to try to give some clarity in this going forward, but as I said it\u2019s going to be a cloudy environment and it\u2019s hard for me to sit here today to say, oh, EDGE is going to contribute X basis points of my profitability. I just don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know what the take rate will be. And I want to make sure we talk about take rate not penetration. So, it\u2019s going to be the take rate of new additions, not the penetration of the base. As far as quarterly earnings, this is a great question, because, historically, you would see more of an uptick in the second and third quarters. And I think now that we have a 100% of Wireless, you are going to see a more consistent earnings per share for us going forward other than the fourth quarter obviously which is more seasonal. So that has its own issues. But, I think you are going to see a more consistent first, second and third quarter and then the fourth quarter will have its own decline, because of the seasonality with that. So that\u2019s a good question and thanks for asking.\nAmir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital:  Thanks a lot for your incremental color, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David, let\u2019s take another question please.\nOperator:  And your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie:  Thanks, can you talk a little about the recent FCC regulatory comments regarding net neutrality and the broadcast auction rules; what your positions are on this and how you think this evolves over the next several months?\nFran Shammo: Yes, so, I know the FCC was issuing an order today on net neutrality. I have not had a chance to look at the order. We will be excited to read that order and then we can give our comments on that. So, unfortunately, being on the call, I have not seen it and been updated on that. And as far as the auctions go, look, I think that, we are obviously preparing for those auctions. As I talked about in the beginning here with our gross debt, we are preparing our balance sheet and our financial wherewithal to participate in these auction is coming up. And, look, as we continue to look at these rules, and work through these rules, we will continue to \u2013 behind the scenes if you will, work with the FCC to get the rules that we need. But, it\u2019s an important step forward for the pool of spectrum available to meet our customer needs and we will certainly take advantage of what the FCC is working on as far as the auctions go.\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie:  And when can we expect to hear more details about your video strategy? I think you said last quarter it would be soon. So, is it still soon or is it very soon?\nFran Shammo: Well, this is \u2013 Kevin, this is on the over-the-top type strategy or?\nKevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie:  Yes and just EdgeCast and VDMS and all of the aggregation of the intellectual property that you bought in the last 12, 18 months.\nFran Shammo: Yes, so, video \u2013 Verizon video, digital media services is ramping up. We are still in what we would call a dataset with a lots of content providers and testing the system and I believe as I said before that will \u2013 that revenue will start to ramp in 2014. So that\u2019s the first step in just putting content through and digitalizing that content potentially inserting ads into that content. Obviously, we added the uplink and the EdgeCast assets to that and really that was in preparation to prepare for the over-the-top if you will. But I think it\u2019s still way too early to tell on the on queue acquisition obviously the first priority for us it IPTV. But as you overlay that to the other asset sets, what I would say is, we are in a great position to take advantage of the marketplace when and if content starts to sort itself out from an over-the-top perspective. So, that\u2019s probably all we would say at this point in time on that one Kevin.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, David, we have time for one more question.\nOperator:  Your last question comes from Joseph Mastrogiovanni of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nJoseph Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Fran, if I could just follow-on to the last question, how should we think about \u2013 how you are thinking about splitting your budget between the AWS and the broadcast auctions?\nFran Shammo: Well, I think it\u2019s too early to tell. I guess, what we are focused on, or at least, what I am focused on right now is the AWS auction which we know will happen at the end of this year with attainment being sometime in the first quarter. So that\u2019s top priority and then we\u2019ll deal with the broadcast licenses after that within 2015. So right now, the priority is AWS.\nJoseph Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse:  Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, that ends our questions. So I\u2019d like to turn it over to Fran for some closing remarks.\nFran Shammo: So, thanks, Mike. So, look everyone, thank you for joining us this morning. And I think I would just recap that said, the first quarter for us was a great start to the year. We consistently invest and focus on the profitable growth to drive strong financial performance and revenue earnings and cash flow, we are focused on customer satisfaction. Our proven ability to scale this business and drive operational efficiencies in order for us to deliver more value to our customers and compete effectively in all areas of our business. We continue to focus on our strategy to deliver the highest quality overall customer experience. We listen to our customers, monitor the competitive environment and respond where necessary in a rational manner. We are very confident in our ability to execute and improve on our business fundamentals driving consistent customer value while delivering growth in customers, revenues, earnings, and cash flow. We are very excited about the future of this industry. We are excited about our investment, the innovation curve that we are delivering. The customer satisfaction that we have and the delivery of value to our shareholders and to our employees, our more valuable assets. So thank you for joining our call this morning and have a great day.\nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. To ask a question, press star, one on your touchtone phone. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing star, Q. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks Carlos. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the investor relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.  This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $1.32 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I\u2019d like to highlight.  Our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities included a pre-tax $3.2 billion credit which decreased our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily non-cash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables, and the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015. We also incurred pre-tax expenses of $613 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these two items amounted to a net $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $254 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $158 million or $0.04 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.71 a year ago, or a growth of 25.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.99 compared with $3.35 in 2014, an increase of 19.1%. On a non-GAAP illustrative basis if we assumed 100% wireless ownership for all of 2014, the adjusted earnings per share growth rate was 16.7% year-over-year. As a reminder, included in our wire line results are the operations from the three states that we agreed to sell to Frontier, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We recognized a benefit of $0.13 per share for the full year due to these assets being classified as held for sale. Additionally, the operations of AOL have been included in our consolidated results since third quarter of 2015. Prior period results do not include AOL. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis Shammo: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and happy new year. Entering 2016, we are confident in our three-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms in video and Internet of Things, and creating certain opportunities and applications and content for incremental monetization. Our execution model enables us to compete effectively in every market condition and build our capabilities for future growth and profitability as an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond. As we reflect back on 2015, we demonstrated a balanced performance in a dynamic competitive environment. We delivered quality growth and strong financial performance in our operating segments while improving our strategic position and returning value to our shareholders. Overall, our full-year adjusted earnings per share grew 19.1% and free cash flow increased to $18.8 billion, excluding tower proceeds, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders. Fundamental execution on our strategies is the priority within our segments. In wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net adds, as well as net phone additions. Postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million for the quarter and 4.5 million for the year, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Net phone additions were 449,000 for the quarter and 1.1 million for the year. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.96%, down 18 basis points for the quarter. For the year, churn was also 0.96%, which improved 8 basis points from prior year. Total wireless revenue grew 4.6% for the year and our EBITDA margin expanded. Our wire line quarterly results were highlighted by Fios revenue and customer growth. Additional enterprise and wholesale revenue slightly improved sequentially while we reduced costs. Overall, our full year wire line segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 30 basis points. We remain committed to consistently investing in our networks for the future. Our 2015 investments have positioned us for growth and allow us to maintain our network leadership position, as consistently acknowledged by third parties. Wireless densification enables us to add capacity to manage the growing trends of video consumption and the demand required for the Internet of Things, as well as prepositioning us for the future 5G technology. We invested in AWS-3 spectrum during the year, acquiring spectrum covering 480 markets for a total value of $10.4 billion.  We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. We are committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2015, we announced the divestiture of certain wire line properties to Frontier and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt. We monetized the majority of our remaining cell towers and we were able to return value to shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase of $5 billion. We have returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders during the year, including dividends. As we disclosed in September, our board of directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.  We remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame, so overall, a strong, balanced 2015 which provides operating momentum and lays the foundation for the future. Now let\u2019s get into fourth quarter and full-year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.3 billion, an increase of 3.2% including revenues from AOL. We are pleased with AOL\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter, which does have some seasonality from advertisers. For the full year, we added $4.5 billion to our top line, representing growth of 3.6%. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 0.5% for the fourth quarter. Excluding both AOL and prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold in 2014, the comparable full-year revenue growth rate was 2.6%. This was below our revenue guidance due to lower wireless phone activations, primarily upgrades, and a less than projected take rate on our device installment payment program in the fourth quarter.  Historically, our consolidated revenues have been primarily driven by growth in both customers and consumption in wireless and Fios. The change in the wireless commercial model from an equipment subsidy model to a device installment payment model increases the revenue sensitivity to wireless equipment volumes. We continued to manage through the transition to the device installment model. We remain committed to our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes on improving the customer experience while increasing our overall operating and capital efficiencies. The focus on increasing efficiencies has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile as we manage through the revenue transformation in the wireless and wire line segments. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $46.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.7%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 35.4%, which expanded 130 basis points from 2014.  Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. In 2015, cash flows from operations totaled $38.9 billion. This total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to tower monetization transaction, which is non-recurring. Free cash flow for the year excluding the tower proceeds totaled $18.8 billion.  We have been successful in selling selected device installment receivables in the private securitization market to finance the device payment program and manage working capital. In the fourth quarter, we continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2.7 billion in cash proceeds. For the full year 2015, we sold a total of $9.4 billion of device installment receivables resulting in total net cash proceeds of $5.9 billion at year-end. We expect to continue to sell these receivables in 2016. Given the success of the device payment program, high credit quality of our customer base and retention history, we are exploring further diversification of funding sources. Our capital spending was consistent with our guidance of around $17.5 billion to $18 billion for the year. In total, capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.8 billion for the full year, up 3.4% from 2014. Our balance sheet is strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $110.2 billion of gross debt, net debt of $105.7 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times. Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on Slide 7. In the wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. Total wireless operating revenues grew 1.2% in the quarter to $23.7 billion. For the full year, operating revenues total $91.7 billion, representing growth of 4.6%. Service revenue of $17.2 billion declined 5.6% for the quarter and declined 3.1% for the full year. Equipment revenue increased to $5.4 billion, up 28% for the fourth quarter, and grew 54.4% for the full year. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing, and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases.  The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to 67% in the fourth quarter compared with about 58% in the third quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter take rate accelerated but was below our expectation of 70%, which contributed to equipment revenue growth that was lower than expected. We expect the first quarter take rate for device installment to be above 70%.  During the quarter, 7.6 million phones were activated on device installment payment plans. We have about 25 million device installment phone connections in total, representing approximately 29% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 40% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 18.9%, and approximately $39 billion for the full year, an increase of 10.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 52.9%, up from 42% for the fourth quarter. The more meaningful measurement is EBITDA as a percentage of total wireless revenue, which expanded to 38.4%, up from 32.6% in the prior year. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin increased to 55.3%, up from 48.5%, and our EBITDA margin on total wireless revenue was 42.5%, up from 40.2% in 2014.  Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. We ended the year with 112.1 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.4% to 106.5 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.6 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.6 million for the fourth quarter and to 16.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.96% in the quarter compared with 1.14% a year ago, an improvement of 18 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience, starting with the network, simplified pricing, and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction.  Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.5 million were high quality, with the sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 906,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 713,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 449,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 960,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 157,000. Full-year net adds of 4.5 million included 3.3 million 4G smartphones and 3.5 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones, and non-tablet internet devices. Let\u2019s now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.4 million in the quarter and 46.6 million for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the year with 73 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 84% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 79% of our retail postpaid connections base. Growth in 4G device adoption is driving increased data and video usage. Approximately 90% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by approximately 60% over the prior year. About 8.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, which is up sequentially but down from just under 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter and $11.7 billion for the full year, up 11.5% from a year ago. We continued to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum, and further successfully densifying urban markets. National studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance metrics that matter to the customer. Improving the cost structure of our wireless segment is a priority. In the fourth quarter, we restructured our wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. We will continue work on our operating model on an ongoing basis and are confident that we can improve efficiencies, as we have done in the past. Let\u2019s move next to our wire line segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, Fios remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents 80.4% of consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.6% and for the full year grew 3.5%. Mass markets revenue grew 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the full year. Small business, which is included in mass markets, experienced declines of 5.6% in the quarter and 4.6% for the full year.  The change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory continues as customers right-size their existing bundles and core voice services decline. The demand for Fios broadband only is also increasing, while we are continuing to see a decline in linear video demand. Customers value having a choice in selecting linear video packages. We had another quarter with custom TV representing about one-third of our Fios video sales.  In the fourth quarter, Fios total revenue grew 6.8% with consumer Fios revenue growing at 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. The increasing importance of the internet is evident as customers are requesting higher data speeds. At the end of the quarter, more than 70% of our consumer Fios internet customers subscribe to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher, and we have shifted our introductory offers to 50 megabits. We are also seeing an increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds.  As I highlighted earlier, Fios internet subscriber growth remains strong in the fourth quarter. In broadband, we added 99,000 net Fios customers for the quarter and 418,000 for the year, and now have a total of 7 million Fios internet subscribers representing 41.8% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 5,000 in the quarter. In linear video, we are seeing slowing of market demand. We added 20,000 net customers in the quarter and 178,000 for the year, and now have a total of 5.8 million Fios video subscribers which represents 35.3% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier on the sale of our wire line properties in Florida, Texas and California and expect to close the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale, as well as the wire line segment in total. In the Enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain but we are seeing stabilization on a constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.3%, and on a constant currency basis was down about 2.1%. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 5.2% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3.5%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. While this quarter improved due to seasonal impacts, we remain cautious on the wholesale business and believe that a 4 to 5% decline is more indicative of the underlying trend for the full year 2016. Total operating revenues for the entire wire line segment improved to a decline of 0.9% in the quarter and down 1.8% for the full year. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.2% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year, up 30 basis points for the quarter and the year.  As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on margins and improving the profitability of the wire line segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the future savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations. As we close on the Frontier sale, we are confident that we will offset the stranded cost at a consolidated level and will report more details post-transaction.  Capital spending in wire line was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $5 billion for the year, down 12.2%, which is consistent with our strategy to reduce our capital spending in the wire line segment. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 for an overview of our three-tier strategy. During 2015, we delivered strong results and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in a dynamic competitive environment as we work through the transition of our wireless base from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model, and ramped up new business models to generate incremental revenue growth into the future. Total revenue grew at 2.6% on a comparable basis, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% for the year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.99 continued to grow at double-digit rates, even if you exclude the depreciation and amortization benefits we realized from the Frontier transaction. Cash flows from operations increased about 19.1% for the year, excluding tower proceeds, and free cash flow totaled $18.8 billion. We delivered more than $13.5 billion of value to our shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase and dividends.  As I discussed in my opening, entering 2016 we are confident in our three-tier strategy. We are executing and delivering strong results today through our operating model by growing and serving our customers while driving cost and capital efficiencies. We are focused on building on our network strength and laying the foundation for global platforms and applications and content that appeal to all market demographics, especially the millennials. We refreshed our brand image around the Better Matters campaign to increase awareness of our differentiated strategy around the overall customer experience and to appeal to growing markets.  At the network connectivity layer, we are investing in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of its new features. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. We opportunistically purchased spectrum during the year to enhance our capacity and position us for the future. As we have done throughout our history, we evaluate spectrum opportunities in a disciplined manner, including the upcoming auction, secondary markets, and future spectrum bands that can be made available. Leadership in 5G technology is another strategy to extend our premier network position. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development, and appropriate requirements for next generation of this wireless technology. We will begin pilots in several locations throughout the year. Our networks enable us to grow our business through new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things at the connectivity platform and solution layers. We are targeting the millennial opportunity in wireless video beyond connectivity. The acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media during the year added strong capabilities with global ad tech platforms and content to complement our digital formatting and content distribution assets. AOL is scaling its consumer and advertiser base globally and it is positioned very well to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends in mobile and video as we saw in the fourth quarter. We will look to further enhance our media asset capabilities. AOL\u2019s global capabilities and partnerships are instrumental to our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens. We believe there is a significant opportunity in using the programmatic platform with the data from the wireless customer base to connect consumers and advertisers in a very targeted and scaled way with relevant and engaging ad experiences while protecting individual privacy. The Go90 application that we launched in 2015 is one element of this broader video strategy that will allow us to capture and aggregate audience, deliver mobile-first content, and generate incremental revenue via advertising. As the application, which used our video platform, evolves and gains attention, you can expect new and exciting content, features and functionality like the NBA content we added this past quarter. We are encouraged by the use of Go90, not only on the Verizon network but off of the Verizon network as well. During 2016, we expect to share more results around both the Go90 application and our video platform.  Earlier this week, we launched FreeBee Data, a new sponsored data service. With FreeBee data, Verizon wireless subscribers can enjoy content on their mobile devices free of data charges, and it helps businesses drive engagement and revenue by providing a powerful platform for sponsoring mobile content. As we have been discussing over the past two quarters, we are offering custom TV for linear customers to provide more video choice. We will look to continue to refresh our Fios TV offerings to take advantage of this secular trend of video bundles with options and more choices to address the increasing over-the-top video trend.  We are taking a leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we have created an ecosystem that will foster innovation and scale globally above the connectivity layer to enable incremental growth. Our network leadership positions us to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both a ubiquitous mobile experience and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer.  We are focused on the telematics and transportation vertical and launched our direct-to-consumer product, Hum, in the third quarter. We also announced our Connected City strategy, beginning with Savannah, and introduced a suite of developer tools, ThingSpace, to accelerate innovative applications to come to market. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, the pipeline for mobile Internet of Things capabilities was very prominent. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing with revenues of approximately $200 million in the quarter and about $690 million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 18%. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 13 for our 2016 priorities. Our strategy and priorities remain consistent for 2016. We will concentrate on growing our quality customer base in both wireless and Fios and build upon customer loyalty by providing the best overall customer experience. We remain focused on network leadership and developing new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things by leveraging our ubiquitous network in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also committed to returning value to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet in addition to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by the 2018-2019 time frame. As previously stated, Verizon expects full-year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparable to our strong full-year 2015 adjusted earnings due to the device installment payment model transition, completion of the Frontier transaction, and the ramping of new business models in video and Internet of Things. Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2016: a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with our full-year 2015 performance; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion - this includes capital spending of approximately $150 million for the properties sold to Frontier, and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million. In terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35 to 36%. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Fran, thank you. We also recognize that there might have been some delay in posting our materials to our website. The issue, I think, is resolved, so we appreciate your patience. Carlos, if you can open us up now for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Mr. David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Stefanski: Carlos, if David\u2019s not there, then we can just move on and pick David up next.\nOperator: Thank you, one moment, sir. \nDavid Barden: Can you hear me now?\nMichael Stefanski: Yes, go ahead, David.\nDavid Barden: There you go. Thanks for taking the questions. Fran, just as a housekeeping item with respect to the notion of a, quote-unquote, plateau, could you kind of band that for people? Are you trying to put a plus or minus 1 or 2% around the $3.99? Are you trying to say $3.99 or better for 2016, just so the Street can kind of get a sense as to where the real midpoint there is? Second, obviously we had an extension in bonus tax depreciation last year. It\u2019s been something you\u2019ve been benefiting from. Could you kind of scope the size of the benefit you\u2019re going to get this year? And if I could, just one last one. You\u2019ve talked about how cord shaving has been important for the new customers coming into the Fios space. Could you talk about if at all you\u2019re seeing some kind of transition in the existing base to these skinnier bundles? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: All right, thanks David. So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think midyear in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparable to 2015 adjusted earnings. The way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. There is $0.13 of depreciation benefit because of the Frontier assets being held for sale, so that really is a level set of $3.86. When we talk about plateauing, we\u2019re referring to the $3.99, so when you think about this, you\u2019re going from $3.86 from a jump-off point to $3.99, so the way I think about it is we\u2019re actually growing earnings in low single digits from 2015 to 2016 when you make that one-time adjustment, so we will grow through the benefit of the deprecation this year. Some of the reasons for that, as I said on the last quarterly call, some of this is just math - moving the wireless transformation from the subsidy model to the device payment model, and of course the ramping of our new businesses which I\u2019ve been very clear in the beginning. These are like start-up businesses, and as with most start-up businesses, you have very large losses in the beginning until you can grow the customer bases and start to generate the profitability. Moving into the bonus depreciation, yes, we will get a substantial benefit next year, but I want to be clear that you should not anticipate that our cash tax payments will decrease in \u201916. They will actually increase, even with this benefit, and a piece of that is because the profitability from a pre-tax income perspective will continue to increase. We\u2019re also still eating through the reversal of prior year bonus depreciations, so from a cash tax perspective you should expect our cash tax percentage to continue to increase closer to our effective tax rate. Now, not to the extent of the 35 to 36 guidance that I gave you, but it certainly will move from the low 20% we realized in \u201915 to the upper 20% in \u201916. On the cord shaving piece, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see more and more customers coming into Fios on a broadband-only basis, so just a single play strictly with broadband. As far as our current base goes, we see a little bit of trending but not much. Most customers are depleting the voice side of the product and keeping the broadband and video side of the product at this point. David, hopefully that answers your question. Let\u2019s move to the next one.\nDavid Barden: Thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: Carlos, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks very much. Good morning, Fran. You touched briefly on the auction in your commentary. I know in the past, you\u2019ve made some of your interest contingent on some of the rules, which we have now. Maybe you could just think about how we should be thinking about sizing your potential participation, what you need here. There\u2019s been a lot of stories about potential asset sales over the months, most recently about data centers. Perhaps you could just talk about your philosophy now that you\u2019ve done the towers, you\u2019re doing the Frontier assets. Should we expect, or are you considering doing other significant asset sales over the coming year or two? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, thanks Simon. So on the auction, let\u2019s just--I\u2019ll keep this one short on the incentive auction because of a lot of rules around what I can and can\u2019t say at this point. We will participate in the auction, and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thinking about spectrum overall, I think we have to think about the 600 megahertz, which I\u2019ve talked about previously and how that fits to our portfolio. We think ahead to 5G - as we said, we\u2019ll be at the forefront and we are currently at the forefront globally talking about standards. We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the United States, and we\u2019re currently preparing for those field trials.  The other thing I would say about 5G is we would hope that the FCC moves quickly to adopt the rules to facilitate 5G deployment. Think about 5G - it may not just be about mobility. It may be about other use cases, not just about mobility.  Then when we think about the unlicensed opportunity, if you studied the Consumer Electronics Show this past two weeks, there were multiple manufacturers who were running side-by-side comparisons of unlicensed, if you will, LTE or unlicensed spectrum utilized by an LTE carrier right next to WiFi, and it absolutely showed no interference, which is some of the rhetoric out there. It actually showed that the comparability is it improves the WiFi performance by having a managed unlicensed within the LTE carrier. So again, this just goes to continuing to work with the FCC and having them see through the release and usage of unlicensed for the LTE carriers. Then of course, we will continue to utilize the secondary market, as we do quarter in and quarter out, utilizing swaps which we just completed this past quarter. We\u2019re working on another swap that we\u2019ll complete in the first quarter, and also minimal buys in the marketplace with smaller holders. So that\u2019s how we think about the whole spectrum asset perspective. On the sale of assets, as Lowell and I have continually stated, we will always look for opportunities. The data centers is an exploratory exercise to see if the asset is more valuable inside or outside the portfolio. I view that asset similar to the way we view towers - is there a way to monetize this asset that contributes value to our shareholders and gives us the capability to move that capital into higher returning assets for Verizon. There is no decision that has been made. This is an exploratory, and as we explore, if the numbers come out like it did on towers, then we\u2019ll execute on a transaction. If it doesn\u2019t, then we won\u2019t. So at this point, again, we will always look at opportunities to monetize the portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you, Simon.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Carlos, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks. Fran, I think the churn below 1% was obviously a bright spot for the quarter. Is that a level that you think you can maintain as you look out into 2016, given the competitive environment? Then you mentioned some continued pressure on the service revenues looking out. Can you talk a little bit about the components driving that and when you expect to see an inflection in that metric? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Sure, thanks John. So one the churn rate, if you recall when we sat here a year ago and we entered 2015, we said a concentration of \u201915 will be to protect our customer base. That\u2019s exactly what we executed on throughout 2015, and the execution of that will continue in 2016. The focus will be customer satisfaction and satisfying our customer base so they stay with us, and I think that\u2019s proven through our very low churn rate this fourth quarter, even with the rhetoric from some outsiders about how they\u2019re stealing customers. The churn rate does not reflect that, and port outs are down year-over-year. So we are doing what we said we would do around the loyalty. Customer satisfaction comes in here around our simplicity and being simple with customers so they understand what they\u2019re getting, and this goes to our loyalty base. On the service revenue side, I guess the thing I would say on this is, again, this is really to math - math of shifting from the subsidy model with higher service revenue to a device payment model, where you get a break in service revenue but you pay full price for the handset model. As we said, we are through 40% of our customers. We\u2019re slightly higher than 40% who are now on that new pricing, so you\u2019ve already seen the impact of that. As I said last call, we believe the inflection point will happen at 50%, which we believe we will attain midyear. Coming out of the fourth quarter, though, we did see a slowdown in the take rate of installment sale, but we do believe that that take rate will accelerate back up above 70% for the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re going to announce some differences here, a shortcoming that will drive some of that behavior towards that. As you know, we continue to allow our current base customers who upgrade to select whether they take device payment or subsidy, and what we saw in the fourth quarter was we had a higher percentage of our base stay on the subsidy model, which caused pressure on the P&L of wireless because of the subsidy take.  So having said that, John, I think as we go through the year, we\u2019ll be able to give you more clarity here. The other thing I would ask you to take a look at is the [IARPA] metric, which if you look at third quarter, it went up by 0.2% and then the fourth quarter went up 0.9%, so you\u2019re already starting to see some of the underlying metrics starting to absorb some of the repricing. So I\u2019ll leave it at that for \u201916, but I\u2019ll come back to you as we break through the 50%.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: Next question, Carlos.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick: Hey guys, thanks. So Fran, first just following up on John\u2019s question, with the current asset mix, and not just in \u201916 but beyond, is this still a business that can grow well above GDP, and how far do you think above? Second on custom TV, you\u2019ve said in the past that you\u2019re sort of pushing toward your minimums on some of your contracts. How should we think about that potentially impacting custom TV, or do you think you could reopen some of those contracts to let that percent go higher? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, thanks Phil. So the answer to the question is yes, absolutely, and I think we have to go back and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story. So first and foremost, I think the foundation is our network, our strategy in densification, the use of fiber. Fiber is going to be critical with the densification, dark fiber. Ninety-two percent of our cell sites are already fiber-enabled, the other 8% are microwave, which probably won\u2019t get fiber. So when you look at it, almost 100% of our cell sites are fiber enabled and every small cell, 100% of every small cell we deployed is fiber backed. So this is in preparation of some of the future products and services that we are looking at in conjunction with both what Marnie has under IOT, Go90, but also for 5G. If you look at customer satisfaction, this goes to a big component of the low churn and how we start to increase the value to the customer so that they are willing to pay us more for increased value. The quality base also goes to this. So when you look at wireless, they grew 1.2% here in the fourth quarter. If you look at volume overall year-over-year, gross adds and upgrades were down 1.9 million, so if you just do the backwards math on that, that\u2019s in excess of a billion dollars of revenue that wasn\u2019t there this year, that was there last year. So when you look at it, the foundation of Verizon wireless is still very strong, and we believe that we can continue to grow the Verizon wireless revenue streams. On wire line, Fios is still the foundation. It\u2019s now 80% of the overall wire line revenue. When you look at what we\u2019re doing, broadband, the pervasiveness of broadband, no one can match our symmetry on the up and downloads, so that\u2019s something that we have against our competition. We are preparing for the over-the-top model. Custom TV is one of those things that I\u2019ve said yes, it has a limited life, but you\u2019re going to see us refresh custom TV and continue to what consumers want, which is they want choice. They don\u2019t want to have to pay for bundles that they never use. Then of course, stability of the enterprise business also adds to this.  Then you jump into our growth engines. If you look at AOL, AOL this quarter increased $300 million in revenue sequentially from the third quarter. It goes to the strength of the advertising model under AOL, which is why we bought them. Now, some of that is seasonal, but we believe that they will continue to have strong growth into 2016.  Go90, which is still in its beginning stages, and I know we\u2019ve seen some external reports on the number of downloads in excess of 2 million, but the key to us is not the downloads. The key is viewership and it\u2019s around content, and we will continue to add content that\u2019s favorable to all generations of population. Obviously we have a lot of content there for millennials, but sports and music attain to a lot more than just millennials, so we\u2019re attacking all viewership with this product and we\u2019ll have more to say about that probably midyear. Internet of Things, if you walked around CES, it\u2019s all about the digital mobile world, and we are in best position to capitalize on that with our Smart Cities, telematics, with the launch of Hum - we started that in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve already seen that there are certain stores in the United States that can\u2019t keep the product within Verizon wireless. They\u2019re continually selling out of the product, and this is a recurring revenue stream. If you think about ThingSpace, this is really the adjunct to the Consumer Electronics Show where we\u2019ve opened up our platform. We now have over 4,200 developers working on that platform, and that\u2019s just since October 29 of this year.  So yes, it was a transition year in \u201915. It will be a transition year in \u201916, but I am confident that with the strategies that we are taking, that we will absolutely be a GDP growth company post-2016. Custom TV, we talked about that. We will refresh that here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements that we need to be in compliance with. Thanks Phil.\nPhil Cusick: Is there a hearing that needs to happen at some point this year, or a trial?\nFrancis Shammo: Relating to ESPN?\nPhil Cusick: Yes.\nFrancis Shammo: Look - this will go its course. They're a great partner of ours. We\u2019ll continue to work with them, and I\u2019m not going to speak to the actual lawsuit.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: Next question Carlos, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike McCormack: Hey guys, thanks. Fran, maybe just a quick follow-up on the [IARPA] question. How fast do you think equivalent revenue starts to ramp up here? I guess just thinking about the percentage of those customers making payments versus those that are on non-subsidized plans, is that gap--and there\u2019s probably some retention built into that, but I assume that gap can close over time? Just your thoughts around that, and then just a quick other question regarding towers. We\u2019ve heard a couple of your competitors sort of downplaying future tower needs and trying to bypass some of that cost. Just trying to get a sense for what you think as far as your needs for towers goes.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, thanks. So in the [IARPA], keep in mind only 29% of our customers currently today are on a device payment plan, so they\u2019re actually taking the installment plan and paying us full price for the equipment, but 40% of our customers who fulfilled their subsidy contract have moved over to that pricing, so they are getting the discount, so we\u2019re absorbing that. As I\u2019ve said, once you get to that 50%, you should see that inflection point start to occur, and you\u2019re already starting to see some of that in the [IARPA] type metric. So it\u2019s hard for me to forecast exactly what will happen here, but the forecast that I have is at 50%, you start to see an inflection point, and we\u2019ll talk more about that as we go through the quarters.  As far as towers go, look - I mean, we continue to build macro towers but at a much slower rate than historically. Our focus is really around small cells, densified antenna systems in-building, but keep in mind that each of those small cells in-building and antenna systems all give fiber back to a main macro cell, so the macro cells still have an important role in how you deliver traffic into those small cells. So as far as building and creating new towers, that\u2019s at a much slower rate but the importance of the tower is still there.\nMike McCormack: Great, thanks Fran.\nFrancis Shammo: Sure.\nMichael Stefanski: Carlos, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. Fran, you had noted had churn in upgrades, they were all lower year-on-year. It seems that across the sector, activity levels have been lighter than we might have thought, whether it\u2019s churn or gross adds or upgrades. Why do you think that is? Do you think that this is a temporary factor or do you think it\u2019s the new normal? Really, I guess the question is what do you think is going to happen in 2016?\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, thanks Brett. So look - 2014 was a unique year. You have a very different form factor come out from Apple, which drove a lot of traffic to that iconic device. You continue to have innovation from Samsung and LG, but we didn\u2019t have that huge change in the handset this year that we saw a year ago, so that, I think, affected some of the upgrade model. But you know, when you look at it, we still did about 1.5 million more upgrades in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter, so the volume of upgrades still increased, it just wasn\u2019t what it was a year ago. If you remember, I said coming into this way back in the second quarter, I said I did not anticipate that the fourth quarter this year would be in similar volume to the fourth quarter of last year, but if you go back to the previous years, I think you\u2019ll see similar lower volume years and then you\u2019ll have iconic devices come out, and it stimulates some usage case there. So for \u201916, it\u2019s too early to tell yet, but I would think that we\u2019ll see similar trends that we did in \u201915.\nBrett Feldman: Are you seeing any evidence that as customers move to installment plans, they actually keep their devices longer?\nFrancis Shammo: Well, for our base it\u2019s too early to tell because the first generation of them are just starting to mature. Until I get some real factual data on that, it\u2019s hard for me to answer. My own personal opinion here is that if you look at history, a third of your customer base upgrades every year. I don\u2019t see that changing, regardless of what plan the customer is on.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Stefanski: Carlos, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike Rollins from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Rollins: Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Just two questions, if I could. First Fran, if you could just talk about what Verizon was able to accomplish on cost-cutting in 2015, and how investors should think about that relative size in 2016. Second, as you look across your different business segments, are you seeing any changes in the macroeconomic backdrop or a risk of a recession? Thanks.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, thanks Mike. So on the cost cutting, look - I think the last three to four years, we\u2019ve talked about this and we\u2019re an extremely disciplined corporation as far as costs go. With the launch of our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program three years ago, that continues to maintain momentum. We took out almost 30 million calls down from a year ago, so there\u2019s a lot of progress being made on self-serve. There\u2019s a lot of progress being made within our logistics system - I mean, this year alone we generated working capital benefits from how we handle our phone inventory. So you saw the wireless restructure this year, was the first restructure we had really since the inception of Verizon wireless.  So as we go into \u201916, you saw us take that severance charge, and I would tell you most of that severance charge was related to headcount that is already completed in the fourth quarter, so entering into 2016 we continue on the path that we were on. We will continue to look at customer satisfaction, more self-serve options that reduce the amount of calls that we have to take from customers. So there is still a lot of work to be done around our cost structure, and if you look at wire line, as we came into this year, Lowell and I said we would improve the profitability of wire line. That came from all the cost reductions that John and his team achieved. So we will continue on that path, and I feel good about that. As far as overall economics, I\u2019m not really seeing much of anything in the consumer spaces that we drive. I look at what everybody else looks at, and we\u2019ll have to wait to see what 2016 comes out, but I\u2019m certainly not going to predict any negativism there.\nMike Rollins: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Carlos, next question. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, good morning guys. Two questions, if I might. First, on Go90, can you update us a little bit on what the early results are and what learnings you\u2019ve had from Go90? Just given your comments about the roughly flat year-over-year EPS and the impact that Go90 might have on that, I think a lot of us have concluded that there\u2019s likely to be something significantly bigger coming this year with respect to marketing and content. Can you at least give us a timeline for when we might see those kinds of developments on Go90?\nFrancis Shammo: Sure, thanks Craig. So when I think about the whole portfolio - Go90, Verizon digital media services and AOL, obviously we just launched all these products, so there\u2019s a start-up. It was the first fourth quarter that we advertised these types of launches. You\u2019re going to see that continue through the four quarters of \u201916, which was not there in \u201915, so there will be pressure from these start-up companies.  Our learnings on Go90 are very simple - we\u2019re looking at how many times individuals revisit the platform in one day, and we\u2019re starting to see some positives there where people will come in multiple times during the day, and that\u2019s important because that\u2019s what\u2019s viable to the advertising community. So the whole basis here is we have to ramp viewership. I will tell you, internally we have surpassed what we thought we would have at this point in time. We have set higher targets for \u201916 because we need to build the viewership in a much quicker fashion. I think what you\u2019re seeing here from AOL is a very strong fourth quarter. Now, there is seasonality to that, but as I mentioned, I\u2019m looking for them to grow substantially in 2016.  So I think when you put this together, I think the top line will start to reflect some of the things that we\u2019re looking for, but it will create bottom line pressure. These will not, especially Go90 will not be profitable product probably within a one to two-year horizon right now. When we launched it, we said two to three, but it\u2019s probably two years before that will become a profit contributor to the enterprise, but it will certainly build on the top line perspective. Right now, we\u2019re focused on viewership, not necessarily the profitability of the product. So I\u2019ll stop there. As I said, we will come in with much more detail probably midyear and start to give you some viewership into exactly some of the results of Go90 and AOL.\nCraig Moffett: And Fran, related to that question, if I could, on AOL, now that you\u2019ve had AOL for a while, there was some talk - and I think you directly spoke to the possibility of a Yahoo! or something like that, are there other assets that now that you\u2019ve had AOL for a while, you think make sense to expand that part of your business with?\nFrancis Shammo: Well, look - I think we\u2019ve been pretty open since we acquired AOL. We said that we would continue to add to that portfolio. We acquired Millennial, which we talked about. So yes, there are things that we continue to look at for fill-ins, if you will. The other one that you brought up, it\u2019s intriguing but there\u2019s really nothing to respond to at this point on that. So, look - we will continue to look at all of our options, as Lowell and I said. We will continue to look at opportunities externally and look at opportunities internally, and if they make sense for the shareholder, then we\u2019ll execute on those opportunities.\nCraig Moffett: Okay, thanks Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay Carlos, time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question will be coming from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much. Fran, you had mentioned that you continue to look to monetize your handset receivables. I think in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that you were looking at other alternatives. Perhaps you might be able to elaborate. We\u2019ve obviously seen your competitors look to other means and funding strategies to support their businesses, so any thoughts on the potential options you are considering would be most appreciated.\nFrancis Shammo: Sure, thank you, Amir. So just to refresh, we monetized or securitized $9.4 billion of receivables. We received gross cash of $7.2 billion. We obviously paid off some of those securitizations, so about a $5.9 billion net cash. So when you think about that, we absorbed about $3.5 billion within our working capital this year from the switch to the device payment model. I will tell you that we have been talking to the rating agencies about different types of financing, and I will probably leave it at that at this point. But we will be looking at potential public markets as well as private markets, but we will stay with the securitization model as well. So we\u2019re just looking at very different alternatives to support the program going forward, because we do believe it will continue to grow in 2016. More to say on that when we come to a conclusion on that one, Amir.\nAmir Rozwadowski: And then if I may, just one follow-up. You folks seem to be taking the lead with discussing a number of new bandwidth enhancing technologies, and you had alluded to this sort of on your prepared remarks around 5G developments and unlicensed spectrum. How should we think about your ability to bolster the carrier\u2019s capacity moving forward utilizing these types of developments, and ultimately do you believe there is a path to improving your capacity without actually having to broadly expand your spectrum portfolio at this point?\nFrancis Shammo: The answer to the question is yes. If you look at some of the small cell technology and also some of the technology that can be utilized at the cell site, I know there\u2019s a fancy name for it but I\u2019m not the engineer here, but it gives you the capability to be able to tilt antennas and turn antennas to where the capacity is. So if you think about football game Sundays and college games, we have the capability to utilize our current resources to increase capacity without any spectrum capacity. So there is a number of technologies that are coming. Obviously when we launched 4G, we said it would be five times more efficient than 3G. 5G is too early, but my suspicion is that we\u2019re going to see some similar benefits there from a capacity standpoint, which is one of the benefits of 5G.  So yes, I think that if you look at spectrum, we are in a very, very good spectrum holding, as we said, with all my other comments around spectrum and how we utilize unlicensed along with what we bought in AWS and the repositioning of what we currently have on 3G over to 4G. So utilizing all of these items, we feel that we are in very, very good shape from a capacity standpoint.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much for the incremental color.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, thank you for your questions. Before we end the call, I\u2019ll just turn it back to Fran for a few remarks.\nFrancis Shammo: Okay, thanks Mike. So look - 2015 was a year of significant change at Verizon, and even with all that change, we delivered a strong financial year, continued to invest in growing our customer base, invested in our networks, developed and expanded new businesses, and returned value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. 2016 will continue what we started in 2015. We will focus on execution and growth with our three-tier strategy and heritage. We will continue to build on a strong network and customer foundation. With our foundation, we will compete effectively in this dynamic marketplace. We will bring new products and services to market and continue to be the leader in the digital first mobile world. We look forward to maintaining our positive momentum to create value for our customers and our shareholders, and I\u2019d like to thank you for joining Verizon today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-10-20 12:44:04", "content": "Executives: Michael Stefanski - SVP, Investor Relations Fran Shammo - CFO & EVP\nAnalysts: Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on the website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2015 we reported earnings of $0.99 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a non-cash pre-tax charge of $342 million or $0.05 per share for a pension remeasurement adjustment due to a settlement accounting threshold that was met in the third quarter. Excluding the effect of this non-operational item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.04 for the third quarter compared with $0.89 a year ago, or a growth of 16.9%. There were no special items of a non-operational nature in the third quarter of 2014. Through the first nine months adjusted earnings totaled $3.10 per share compared with $2.65 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would've been higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate was about 14% for the first nine months of 2015. As a reminder our Wireline results include the operations in the three states that we agreed to sell to Frontier. These operations will be included until the transaction closes, which we expect at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Also as previously noted, we are no longer recording depreciation expense on these assets as they are classified as held for sale. We continue to estimate that the full year 2015 earnings benefit of lower depreciation expense will be about $0.13 per share. In terms of the AOL acquisition, which closed in late June, our third quarter consolidated results include the operations of AOL, which are reported as part of corporate and other. We have not restated prior history to periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, and will not include AOL results. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our business and deliver strong financial performance, which actively positioning the business for future growth and profitability. We are very committed to building the business for the future and we are doing so through investments in our existing networks, as well as the platforms that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new areas like mobile video and the Internet of things. We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model. In addition to our consistent investment strategy, we are also committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have had a very active year with capital investments in spectrum purchases, which position us for the future growth, the strategic acquisition of AOL and the return of more than $11 billion in value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, where remaining on track with our previously stated deleveraging plan. In early September, our board of directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.  On the operational front, our focus is to provide customers with consistent network reliability and a great customer experience, and we are competing very effectively in all parts of the business. We once again delivered strong earnings growth and free cash flows. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net ads, as well as net phone addition.  Postpaid net ads totaled 1.3 million, which does not include any wholesale or Internet of things connections. Net phone add additions were 430,000. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.93%, down 7 basis points from last year. Total Wireless revenue grew 5.4% and our EBITDA margin expanded. Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by FiOS revenue and customer growth, with sequential increases in both in Internet and video subscribers. Our segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 50 basis points.  Now, let's get into our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide four. Total operating revenue was $33.2 billion, an increase of 5%, which as Mike indicated, includes revenues from AOL. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 3.1%. Our consolidated revenues have been consistently driven by customer and usage growth in both Wireless and FiOS. Our overall revenue mix continues to change, driven by the unsubsidized equipment model, increasing video demand in Wireless and a higher mix of broadband and FiOS. As these trends evolve over the near-term we expect future revenue growth to result from increased video and Internet of things traffic, enabling new business models in wireless and continued broadband demand in Wireline. In terms of our mobile video strategy earlier this month we were the first to market with the commercial launch of go90tm, a differentiated, mobile-first social entertainment platform. Go90 includes a broad selection of premium content and social engagement features, and the capability for sharing and conversation around the content. The initial feedback has been strong with increasing engagement without significant promotion, and we have received positive industry recognition. As go90 develops, we will be adding more great content, features and advertising opportunities. You can expect a flow of product enhancements creating a new ecosystem for digital creators and advertisers, and a video consumption model that we can monetize in multiple ways. AOL is expected to play a key role in the success of our video strategy. The acquisition of AOL significantly improves our digital media and advertising capabilities. These capabilities will be a key component of our video business model, which will be driven by digital mobile advertising in the future. We are taking a strong leadership position in the Internet of things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications we are creating an ecosystem that will foster innovation and expand the entire IoT market. Here are few examples of our early initiatives. In August we announced the commercial availability of Hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service creating a connected car driving experience that can operate in more than 150 million vehicles in the United States. We are very active in Smart City solutions market and we have already announced a partnership with the city of Savannah, Georgia. Municipalities like Savannah are looking to take advantage of our intelligent solutions to integrate its parent systems, monitor traffic and safety conditions in real-time to improve efficiency and public safety. These are just a few examples of the many opportunities we are pursuing. We are very well positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both the ubiquity of mobile service and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. This will enable us to monetize usage through new commercial models, include data analytics and applications. New revenue streams from the Internet of things continued to emerge and grow with revenues of $175 million in the quarter and about $495 million year-to-date. As our revenue mix expands we are focused on improving the customer experience while reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. The focus on cost structure has enabled us sustain a strong earnings profile.  Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion, up 7.5% on an adjusted basis, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 80 basis points to 35.8%.  Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide five. Cash flows from operations were $9.5 billion in the third quarter, and totaled $28.4 billion year-to-date. The nine-month total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. In the third quarter, we continued to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $2 billion in cash proceeds. Free cash flow for the first nine months, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.4 billion in the quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. Our balance sheet remained strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $112.3 billion of gross debt, net debt of $108.4 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4 times.  Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide six. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.4% in the quarter to $23 billion. Service revenue of $17.6 billion declined 4.1% while equipment revenue increased to $4.3 billion, up 73%. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.2%. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured and equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device installment plans increase and more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing. In early August, we simplified our pricing structure centered on the device installment model. The pricing change simplified the customer experience at the point of sale and provided a cleaner structure for managing their accounts. Existing customers can still choose to sign a two year service contract and remain on subsidized pricing when upgrading to a new device. Additionally, business customers do not generally select device installment plans. Consistent with our expectations, the percentage of phone activations on installment plans grew to about 58% in the third quarter compared with 49% in the second quarter, and 12% in the third quarter of last year. In the fourth quarter, we expect the percentage of phone activations on device installment plans to increase to around 70%. During the quarter, 5.6 million phones were activated on device installment plans. We have about 19 million device payment phone connections in total, representing approximately 22% of our postpaid phone base. Overall more than 30% of our postpaid phone customers are on unsubsidized service pricing. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.2%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.4%, up from 49.5%. As we have said before, we believe a more relevant measure of profitability is EBITDA as a percentage of total wireless revenue, which expanded to 43.2%, up 160 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, our EBITDA margin was 43.9%, up 100 basis points from a year ago. Now let's turn to Slide seven and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 110.8 million total retail connections. This total does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.9% to 105 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.7 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.93% in the quarter, compared with 1% a year ago.  Each quarter this year we have improved our year-over-year postpaid churn rate between 4 and 7 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service calling rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction. Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.3 million were high quality. With a sequential improvement in the number of smartphone and total phone net adds, we added 889,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 694,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 430,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 818,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 80,000. Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide eight. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.6 million in the quarter, down about 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 71.5 million smartphones in total and our smartphone penetration increased to more than 82% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 76% of our retail postpaid connections base. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage. Approximately 89% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network and overall traffic on LTE has increased by about 75% in the past year. About 7% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. The quality of our overall postpaid phone base continues to improve. Through gross adds and upgrades, our 4G phone base has increased by roughly 34% in the past 12 months to $64.6 million. We still have a sizable 4G upgrade opportunity with roughly 15 million basic phones and nearly 7 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base. Tablets are also under penetrated in our postpaid base at only 10%. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.9 billion in the quarter and $8.5 billion year-to-date, up 8.4% from a year ago. We continued to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s best reliability and to position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are focused on improving our network capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effective management of our spectrum inventory and further densification in urban markets. Our densification program is progressing well and it is achieving the capacity gains that we expected on the spectrum that is in service. For example in Chicago, we are on our plan for small cell deployments covering key locations with distributed antenna systems and expanding our in-building coverage. This has helped support approximately 75% data growth on the network, while maintaining our number one ranking in network quality according to both internal and external competitive benchmark studies. National studies continued to consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance. Densification is just one aspect of our network evolution strategy. We are working on centralizing network radio control to enhance capacity and provide operational efficiencies, while beginning to implement a software defined network architecture, laying the groundwork for new innovative services and applications. We are extending our network leadership into 5G with our announcement several weeks ago that we are leading the technology forum with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standard developments and appropriate requirements for the next generation of wireless technology. Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide nine. In the consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of revenue growth, and now represents 79% of consumer revenue. In the third quarter consumer revenue grew 2.8% and mass markets, which include Small Business, grew 1.8%. As we expected, there was a change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory. The primary reason for the decline is driven by lower paid TV subscriber growth, and an increase in customers rightsizing their existing bundles. While FiOS broadband continues to grow, we are seeing a decline in the percentage of triple play customers. In addition, we continue to see interest in our custom TV offering, which offers more choice and control at a lower price point. We expect the continued adoption of custom TV will pressure revenue growth, but result in a higher contribution margin. In the third quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 7.1% driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. Our Quantum broadband service continues to scale and because there are no content costs has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, roughly two-thirds of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabit speed tier, where one fourth of our Quantum customers currently subscribed. As I highlighted earlier, FiOS subscriber growth improved sequentially in the third quarter. In broadband we added 114,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.9 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.7 penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 2000 in the quarter.  In video, we added 42,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.6% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier to finalize the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California, and to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and ensure a seamless transition. We are making good progress and have secured for approvals from the DOJ, SEC and the State of Texas. We expect to close a deal at the end of the first quarter of 2016. As we prepare to divest these properties, we are focused on reducing our shared cost structure post transaction. In addition, we will also take this opportunity to significantly reduce the broader cost structure of the entire Wireline business.  Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover Enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, global Enterprise revenue declined 4.9% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.1% in the third quarter. In both businesses we continue to see similar trends impacting growth, with secular declines in legacy transport revenue and competitive price compression in other services. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.3% in the quarter. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5%, up 50 basis points and on a year-to-date basis expanded 20 basis points to 23.2%. As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on expanding margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning, and are seeing improvements in productivity. We will continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs with some of the future savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations. Capital spending in the Wireline was $1.2 billion in the third quarter and totaled $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 18.6%. Let's move next to our summary slide. Throughout 2015 we have executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high value customers and delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. We have also continued to consistently invest in our networks and platforms to position us for the future growth. Our year-to-date consolidated revenue growth was 3.3%, after adjusting for the inclusion of AOL this quarter and the sale of the public sector business in 2014. On the same basis, we continue to expect revenue growth of at least 3% for the full year 2015. Our adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4% with margin expansion of 80 basis points to 36.6%. Excluding the Tower proceeds, cash flows from operations were up about 13% year-to-date and free cash flow totaled $13.5 billion. We have added 3 million net postpaid Wireless subscribers, including total phone net adds of 613,000. Our new customer growth is high quality with 2.4 million new 4G smartphone customers and 2.5 million new 4G tablets. We have also improved the quality of our postpaid base through upgrades and effective customer retention and have approximately 10 million more 4G smartphone customers than we did at the beginning of this year. In FiOS broadband, we have added 319,000 new subscribers, and 158,000 in FiOS video. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of things to monetize usage on our networks and expand our revenue mix. In time, these incremental revenues will become more meaningful to our overall top line growth. The launch of new products like go90 and Hum are examples of where we can monetize usage of the network and platform layers, providing more diversity to future revenue streams.  With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you, Fran. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks very much. Good morning Fran. I think Lowell had talked recently about earnings plateauing in 2016. Could you just give us a little bit more color about the puts and takes with the Frontier divestiture and \u2013 during the end of the first quarter and all the cost cutting. And then any updates on the [600] auction given that the application rules came out last week? Thank you.\nFranShammo: Sure. Good morning Simon.\nSimon Flannery: Good morning.\nFranShammo: So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess it is first off, let us start with this simple piece, which is \u2013 some of which is just pure math. So when you look at this wireless model, and converting from a subsidized phone model to an installment plan model, as we have been pretty transparent with all of you, there was a GAAP accounting that falsely increased the earnings of any company who adopted this model, and that we have tried to be as transparent as possible giving you the baseline in the beginning, but that became more complicated. And what we have said going forward is look, the better measurement here is not service margin EBITDA but regular EBITDA percent on total revenue because that kind of normalizes out the fact that we are now recording 100% of the revenue upfront for the sale of the equipment, rather than a subsidy and then recouping that through service pricing over a period of time. So when you take that into consideration, as you plan out the curve on the installment sale and penetration of the base, and I said in my prepared comments, our base is \u2013 30% of our base is already on this new pricing. So as you go into \u201916 and you get into that 50%, it starts to normalize out the earnings impact that was accelerated through the year 2015. So I guess what I would say is if you took out the impact of that in \u201915, and you look at \u201914 to \u201915 earnings growth, you would probably get a more normal growth trend than what we are delivering in double-digit growth now and then if you put that normalization to the \u201916, we actually would have grown earnings, but because of the math exercise here, you are getting the flatness in that GAAP accounting. So that is part of it. The next piece of it is as we have said also with the divestiture of the Frontier properties in the [South], these are classified as properties for discontinued operations. And for the year, we're anticipating that's going to be a $0.13 to $0.14 EPS lift, because we discontinue the depreciation of those properties. So, again that has to get normalized out as we go into '16. So, if you looked at it today, we are reporting $3.10 to-date. We have about a $0.11 of benefit. So, it'd be around a $2.99 versus $2.65 of last year. The next thing is, if you look at the divestiture of those properties as we've said, these are higher margin properties, and since we are more of a centralized cost based company, we have a lot of allocations into those three property. So, as I said before when we announced the sale, we have this what we call stranded cost that we need to work out of the business since the time that we announced this. I think we've proven a great track record here at wireline, that we know how to do this. If you look at year-over-year, we are down over 8,000 resources because of all the system enhances and profits improvements that we've made through processes and frontline execution on more online billing and so forth. So, we know how to do this and we got about five more months to go, but we also have to consider the fact that we're in the middle of a labor negotiation and some of those benefits won't be realized until we come to an agreement with the labor. So, this is more of a timing issue on this one. We will realize those benefits, as you know the last time we entered into a labor negotiation, we said that we would incur about $500 million worth of savings over the three years. And you can see that coming through the EBITDA of wireline. So, I think that's important. Then of course the last piece of this is, as you can see in our results this quarter, you're seeing more of a ramp in corporate for the start-up businesses. So, as any start-up business goes, you incur losses upfront, because you're investing in the product development, you're investing in the marketing and the promotional of that new business. And that's going to be a drag on earnings through '16 because the revenue will not kind of catch up with the cost. So, when you take all that into the consideration, that's where low was mentioning and forecasting more of a flat if you will or flat-toe for 2016.\nSimon Flannery: And that's the GAAP --\nFran Shammo: And just chiming on the update of the 600 megahertz. As you know, application to participate as buyers, the FCC did some forward part of the auction and which are expected to be due in January. And the whole purpose of this was to give the broadcast or is a sense of what the bid would be that they would receive. And now the broadcast was how that chance to look at that and decide whether they're going to participate or not. I think one important thing here, though, too, is that after we saw the abuse in the AWS-3 Auction by Dish, I think the FCC should learn from this and not give preferences to large corporations, award credits or set aside and the government shouldn't be in the business of picking winners and losers. Let the consumer do that. So we'll have to see how the rules play out here but at this point, we do plan to participate but we'll see how the rules play out and then we will go from there.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nFran Shammo: Brad, we're ready for the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks. Maybe two questions if I could. Just, first on the Fran disclosure about the 22% devices be on EIP plans but 30% of customers being on EIP pricing. Could you talk about the difference there, is that BYOD, is that a forward pricing strategy that you are starting to implement? It'll be helpful to understand that. And then just second on the, we unfold the go90 strategy and think about content acquisition. Now that AT&T and DTV are together, is there any thought about revisiting Verizon's historical kind of conversations with the cable industry about maybe joining forces to try to work together on content and distribution and allocation of resources? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Hi, thanks David. Good morning. So, on the difference between the 22% on edge and the 30% on pricing, obviously, if customers have fulfilled their contract over the two year period time under the old subsidized model, those customers are free and always have been free to select whatever price plan they want and we are allowing them to move to the new pricing because they fulfilled their contractual obligation under the old pricing. So, in essence they are bringing their previous device into the new pricing. So, that\u2019s part of it. The other thing is that, there is a little bit of forward pricing here with current customers and as we talked before on calls, we have pretty diligent exercise where we go through our customer base and we attack the high value customers who we think will have a higher propensity to churn from us. So, there is some proactiveness there. And I think you're seeing that come through on the reduction of churn through this year of 4 basis points to 7 basis points. And I would anticipate the going into the fourth quarter, you should consider us to be within that improvement on a year-over-year basis. Now, given the fourth quarter is always a generally a higher churn quarter as it was last year, but we do believe that we will see a consistent improvement as we have seen through the beginning of this year. As far as go90, look, go90 is a very different product set. It's mobile first, a social entertainment platform. Let me just talk a little bit about where we are here. But this really is just a totally different perspective than linear TV and content deals. And we know how to do that and we've been doing that for 10 years with files. But this is a very different platform. Keep in mind we are 20 days into this. We actually haven't done any advertising or promotion activity around this product. So, for early stages, we are seeing very good platform stability. We are seeing very encouraging feedback. And of course we're looking at some very specific matrix here of what's the viewership, how many times do people revisit the site, and what do the new shows capture. And if you haven't downloaded, I would encourage you to, because we now have over 10,000 assets in the product. We have two exclusive episodes; one is called Top Five Live and the other one is called Betch - \"B-E-T-C-H\". And these are really starting to take form with the Millennials. And we are starting to see a number of encouraging revisits to the platform on a daily basis to see what Top Five Live and Betch are doing. And we have 48 more exclusive content deals coming that will be on this product before the end of the quarter. So, go90 right now we are seeing very good upstage but again we really haven't started to advertise the platform. We do have entertainers tweeting the platform who are part of the platform like Kanye West on his live show. So, there is a lot happening in this platform. So, we are really pleased with the initial stages, but this is very different than the legacy linear TV model. So, I will stop there, David. Thanks for the question.\nDavid Barden: Thanks Fran.\nFran Shammo: Brad, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hey guys, thanks. Fran, can you talk about the Custom TV effort and what you are seeing overall in the video landscape. It seems like the 42,000 this quarter was a little bit weaker than we would have thought, given seasonality. I wonder if you are still having any advertising issues or if this is just the way we should look at it going forward? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Phil, good morning. The TV environment this past quarter was extremely competitive and continues to be. Custom TV, though, actually within the portfolio is performing similar to what it did last quarter, with the number of people choosing the product and the number of migrations that we have within the product. And of course, as we said, this is going to put a little bit of topline pressure on FiOS growth. And the reason for that is the way I have to think about this is the new bundle is about $20 less than the average normal FiOS bundle. But the offset to that is we are also getting an incremental benefit in the content cost. So, we're seeing an incremental margin gain by people selecting the Custom TV package. I think what is more important though is the consumers are speaking to the total linear environment that says \"they only want to pay for what they want to watch and they don't want to pay for 300 channels when they watch only about 10% of those channels.\" So, I think that\u2019s more important is to where the ecosystem is going. We will continue to support Custom TV. As we said we know we have some disputes that we're working through but Custom TV right now is doing what we thought it would do. As far as the growth perspective, I think, if you look at last quarter with the negative 625,000 negative adds, we continue to be positive, so we are gaining share, but look the environment is Millennials don't want linear TV content. They are disconnecting their cable for just internet content and mobile content and that goes to why we are launching go90 with the mobile first perspective and that\u2019s attacking that entire segment that FiOS brand does not attack today through our linear TV product.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks. When you reported the second quarter, you talked about Custom TV, most people were taking only the basic sort of 55. Have you seen that evolve upward a little bit as we're seeing for both season and other things starting to form?\nFran Shammo: Phil, no, we haven't. The basic package is the basic and then you get two packages included. Now, of course you have a selection of those package among seven. Some people are selecting the sports, others are selecting the live like Hallmark station and those things. Yes, generally sports fanatics generally take a premium package. So Custom TV more is for those folks who really aren't interested in sports and are taking less of the sports channels but it's more or less the same trend not seeing any difference there.\nPhil Cusick: Got it. Thanks, Fran.\nFran Shammo: Brad, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Good day, thanks. Back to wireless, Fran, if we could. You had a handset upgrade rate of about 7% which is down slightly on a year-over-year basis. But there is a much better comp coming up in the fourth quarter of '14. We did almost 10%. Do you expect a bigger sort of year-to-year decline in the fourth quarter here and if so what kind of impact could that have on the margins? And then if you could give us a sense for how you expect given the trends you are seeing with installment plans '16 over '15, would be great. Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, John. So, on the handset piece for upgrades. What I would say is we are anticipating a little less volume than last year because of the total iconic launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. But this quarter we are still anticipating a fairly heavy volume quarter as every fourth quarter is, but I would anticipate a little less than what we saw last year. So, I would think that upgrades would be a little less than what we ran last year. As far as what we see from a take rate on installments going into 2016, look, at this point we are guiding to 17% in the fourth quarter. We are now 100% at the point of sale with Edge only. Of course, we have an exemption for current customers who are on the subsidy model who can opt to take a new subsidized handset. So, I'll have to see how that works going into 2016 and that may keep us around that 70% to 75% take rate but it's too early to tell. So, I don't really want to give guardianship on what the take rate will be. Let\u2019s see how we come out the fourth quarter, I will readdress that in the first quarter.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, Fran.\nFran Shammo: Brad, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMike McCormack: Hi guys, thanks. Fran, just thinking about the uptake of factoring -- of EIP and looking into next year, you have got two competitors getting very aggressive on leasing. Just a sense for your thoughts on leasing as a structure and then secondly the prepaid declined, is that just sort of defocusing on that segment or you are actually seeing some wins on the postpaid side from the prepaid base? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Yes, thanks Mike. So, on the EIP, yes we have gone to the full Edge product. As I've said before, I am not interested in a rental program. We are not seeing any impact from those programs from the competitors in our base and I think our results speak to that this quarter and I think they'll speak to that in the fourth quarter as well. I think what you'll see is if you speak to the rating agencies, they are becoming very concerned with the balance sheet risk of some of the industry on putting up rental phones on the balance sheet with what the residual value will be with those rental phones. So, again, as I have said before, that\u2019s not something that we are entertaining at this point. Again, I never say \"never say never\" but that is not something that I would have an appetite for. On the prepaid decline, I think, look, generally if you look at how postpaid and the price points of postpaid and I've talked about this before. Postpaid pricing is more or less mirroring what prepaid pricing was in the past. And we are seeing some migration of our prepaid product customers to postpaid, but it's more probably limited than some others because of our intense credit models and you have to pass the credit in order to become postpaid. But there is a segment of prepaid customers that are good credit customers, that now that the price point is closer to affordability for them on postpaid, they are moving into the postpaid product. So, I don't really look into the prepaid product decline as a problem set for us at this point. We generally really compete with prepaid in our reseller model with companies like TracFone and StraightTalk and Straight Wireless and that\u2019s where we really drive home the lower-end product without our brand connected to it. So, and that although we don't disclose much in reseller any more, that segment continues to perform well for us.\nMike McCormack: I guess, Fran, on the residual risk, because that\u2019s just you think secondary market can become softer or new devices being launched or is it just an overall view on risk in the balance sheet?\nFran Shammo: If you look at some of the programs, you have balloon payments that are doing 18 months. 18 months from now the market is changing. There is a lot of Apple product hitting in the Chinese market now, where China was one of the larger areas where we sold off used handsets. So, as these markets get heavily penetrated with newer product, that could impact the residual value of these phones going forward. So, it's just a risk that it's going to have to be handled by the industry under that program and at this point that\u2019s not something we want to deal with.\nMike McCormack: Great. Thanks, Fran.\nFran Shammo: Brad, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. First, Fran, could you talk a little bit more about what the mobile data usage looks like. You talked about the mix of data that's on 4G LTE, I am kind of curious how much does the customer use, how much is the data growing year-over-year in that metric set; you can help on that basis. And then, secondly, you described that the service revenue plus installment billing was 1.2% up year-over-year. As you're making the transition to these new great plans, the unbundled installment plans, what\u2019s the risk, does that goes lower before it goes higher? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Michael. On mobile data, what we are seeing right now is that the trend across our entire network of 75% growth year-over-year, obviously, some of the metropolitan areas like in New York and Chicago are higher than that. I mean, Chicago we said is up 75% but New York, San Francisco, some others are higher than that in growth rate. So, it depends where you are at and then we have markets obviously lower than that because of more of rural areas. So, that\u2019s generally what we are seeing in the network right now. On the installment sale billings of 1.2%, yes, I do believe that will go lower as we make this transition into 50% of our base for installment sale. So, the trend of service revenue and the installment billings plus the service is going to continue to decline, until we get into that middle part latter part of 2016 where the curve will reverse and then you will start to see that flattening out and start trending back up just like the math would dictate.\nMichael Rollins: And could that go negative?\nFran Shammo: I am sorry? Go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Could it actually be a rate of decline, during this transition?\nFran Shammo: No. I think what you are seeing now if you look at the previous quarters, it's pretty trending about the same. I don't think it's going to accelerate.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nFran Shammo: Brad, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you, very much. And good morning Fran and Mike.\nFran Shammo: Good morning, Amir.\nAmir Rozwadowski: I was wondering if we might be able to discuss a bit more about your midterm thoughts on the competitive landscape. For some time, of course, we've seen the impact of increased competition in the market with respect how devices are sold, pricing of services, etcetera. And at least from our end the most draconian fears have yet to be realized. As we head into 2016, both of the comparatively smaller carrier seem to be positioning themselves to be levering up here, albeit one of them synthetically through the lease company. With that in mind, are we potentially entering a period in which the focus may increasingly shift towards increased returns versus one that\u2019s overly emphasizing competition and if so how do you believe you can fare in that type of environment?\nFran Shammo: Amir, first of all, let\u2019s set the stage that the wireless industry has always been very competitive. And even through all this competitiveness, the industry themselves continues to grow even though everyone thinks that the industry is slowing we continue to have net adds overall. Tablets become a bigger piece, data continues to grow. So, the industry overall although very competitive, continues to grow despite all that. Our focus has always been competing on a network quality, reliability and simplicity. And that\u2019s how we have been winning for the past 18 years and that\u2019s our focus going forward. And you can see that with our new brand campaign, better matters, because what we believe with our brand in our campaign is we're trying to send the message that although some say video and data are not as important and people are willing to get disrupted, I think if you talk to the Millennials, the thing that frustrates them the most is the spinning wheel when they want to watch a video or download something. So, our focus on our brand is better does matter. We have the best network, we are the most reliable, and we become a more simple company to deal with our simplicity of pricing. So, that\u2019s where we look to compete. I think the fourth quarter will be a competitive quarter as it always is every year. I think you're going to see promotions in the marketplace and this industry is going compete as we always have. But I think our differentiation is how we differentiated ourselves through this whole entire process of installment sale and now rental and as I said before the rental programs don't seem to be having any impact or appeasing to our customers. So, I would say that we will continue to do the same. As far as how the industry changes, I think what you are seeing from us is we're going in a different direction with our go90 launch. We are appealing to our Millennial population with our network and our products and I do think that as we said before you can only price down so much and then you need to generate cash, And I think as you said some have to start generating cash in order to invest in their networks to support the growth of the data or else things are going to start to fall apart. And I think you are starting to see some of that in some of the national RootMetrics drive test, where some of the networks are starting to feel pressure and starting to fall down in the ranking. We continue to invest heavily in our networks as I said before. You should continue to see us as a flat overall capital company but wireless continues to trend up and that\u2019s important for the product set that we are launching. So, I do think there will be more focus on returns and profitability and that\u2019s good for the industry.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you, very much for everything and then for color.\nFran Shammo: Brad, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. I then go back to the question I think David asked earlier about sort of your relationship with the cable industry. And one of the things that has come up is the MVNO agreement that you guys signed several years ago and because it was signed several years ago it's perceived to be maybe a little outdated. And so I am just curious, do you still feel comfortable with the agreement the way it structured. Do you feel like it's enabling the cable companies to do whatever they want? And are you open-minded if they approached you about redoing it if they felt that the industry has evolved to a point where the agreement was stale and was not likely to create value for either you or for them?\nFran Shammo: Well, I think that you stated, Brett. We have an existing MVNO agreement and we were informed that they are going to execute on that agreement and the agreement is the agreement. I am not going to get into whether we're discussing of revising the agreement or the terms and conditions of that, since it's under NDNA and we will see how this plays out. Obviously the industry is moving. Cable is going to do what they are going to do and we're going to do what we're going to do. I think that again though what I would say is we truly believe that Wi-Fi is a complementary wireless network if you will with LTE and we don't believe one replaces the other. Just like when we launched LTE, we said \"look it's not going to replace Wi-Fi, it's not going to replace broadband into the home.\" Similar, Wi-Fi is not going to replace LTE. So, I think that\u2019s where it stands right now, so, I really won't interject any more around the MVNO.\nBrett Feldman: All right. Just a quick follow-up, since you mentioned Wi-Fi and I was thinking about small sales. I think you had earlier said you are looking to deploy unlicensed LTE maybe in trial phases, I think either this year or early next year. Where are you on that?\nFran Shammo: We are right on course. We are actually testing in the labs now and we are looking to deploy some time in 2016. And again, the unlicensed LTE is a great piece for us to increase our capacity. And again, another differentiator between LTE and Wi-Fi, is LTE is a fully managed network, Wi-Fi is not. So, when you start to load up Wi-Fi, that\u2019s why you start to see real degradation in service, whereas, with LTE and then overlaying unlicensed LTE. We can dynamically increase capacity when we see that that capacity needing increase. So, it's going to be a very viable tool for us in order to increase capacity without deploying a lot of dollars.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nFran Shammo: Brad, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, you talked a little bit about the upcoming options. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about how you think about different spectrum bands at this point with the options I guess out there being 600 MHz from the option versus 2.5 GHz from Sprint that maybe per sale versus Charlie Ergen's spectrum that's mostly in the 2.1 range. And then if you could also just talk about on the wireline side. How do you think about your commitment to the wireline business in FiOS going forward with LTE coming into the New York market? Are you divesting some properties outside of the Northeast, is that still a meaningful focus or would you look to reduce your exposure to wireline if you had the opportunity?\nFran Shammo: Thanks, I appreciate it. On the auction and the spectrum bands, it's a good question because the current auction is 600 MHz band and as you know we deployed LTE contagiously on 700 MHz that doesn't mean that we can't operate with 600 MHz but 600 MHz and 700 MHz don't play well together. There is a lot of interference. So, where we have 700 MHz, there will be a lot of work to deploy a 600 MHz spectrum. But there is areas where we could use lower band spectrum but it's probably not the top priority. We like the higher band like AWS. We've said that all along that Charlie is sitting on very good spectrum. It's very good for capacity, which is why we spent $10.4 billion in the auction. But we also can do things like we've done in Chicago and New York, where we felt the license cost was way too high and we instead decided to deploy small cells and get capacity in a more reasonable cheaper way, if you will. Now, some of this spectrum will come back to market. We don't know how the FCC will treat that yet. So, we'll just wait and see but higher frequency spectrum is capacity and that\u2019s really what we need at this point in time. As far as the wireline commitment, look, I think with the three divestitures in the South, they were more or less footprints which were not contiguous to anything else. Most of that property was copper, not fiber. So, when we look at the East Coast, it's a much different footprint. I mean, we'll have covered over 70% of the footprint with our FiOS product. We are very committed to it. We are investing over $4 billion into the wireline company, a year. So, that shows our commitment from a capital investment perspective. We've already passed 20 million homes when we committed to originally 18 million. So, we are very committed to the FiOS product. It goes hand in hand with our wireless strategy. And I think if you've asked anybody like you know tease, if you are going to come in and compete for Fiber Into The Home, you certainly would either pick the East coast or the West coast, and they've started with Cablevision in East coast. So, we have a very viable footprint and we are committed to that. Now, again, as I've always said, \"you never say never\" and of course Lowell and I are always open to new options and we always keep our eyes open for that. But at this point we are very committed to the wireline business.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: Brad, we have time for one more question. If you can please see that up.\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. So, my question is on enterprise. And I just wondered if you're seeing any notable changes in competitive behavior versus other carriers. And then just on wireless, on the network side, if you could just remind us the approximate timeline for AWS-3 deployment. And then when would the network be ready for LTE-only phones to be sold at retail? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Okay, great. Hi. So, Jonathan, on the enterprise piece, I guess what I would say is we are seeing more or less the same, there has really been no change. I think there is a lot of competition. There is a lot of price compression continuing in the IP space, as we said before the strategic side around security and data centers. But even within the data center space, now there is an awful lot of competition happening with price compression. So, I think what you are seeing is the trend that we think will continue as we revamp the portfolio if you will and come into more of whether we're going to willing to compete. So, I think you are just going to see more of the same here. As far as the wireless network and deployment of AWS, you were looking at probably in the 17, 18, timeframe. With that, similar to where LTE, you would be for starting in 16 and then of course, so that will continue to deploy there. And then on the phone-only where we would only get a LTE only handset probably more to the end of 2016 as where we're looking to deploy in LTE-only handset.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you. Okay, Brad. That takes us to the end of the questions, but I would like to turn the call back on to Fran to close.\nFran Shammo: All right. Thanks, Mike. I just like to close with a few key points. So, through the first nine months, we have solidly executed on our fundamentals, delivering quality customer growth and strong financial results while positioning the business for the future and returning value to shareholders. This execution has generated strong cash flows, enabling us to consistently invest in our networks, platforms, future growth, and innovation. In addition, we have returned value to shareholders and maintained a strong balance sheet, keeping us on track with our leveraging plans. As I highlighted earlier, we have returned more than $11 billion to-date through dividends, and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. In September, our Board of Directors again re-innervated their confidence with a 2.7% dividend increase; making this the ninth consecutive year of a dividend increase. We look forward to maintaining our positive momentum in the fourth quarter, as we execute our strategy, launch new products and services like go90, positioning ourselves for future growth and creating value for customers and shareholders. Thank you, again, for joining Verizon today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Marley. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. GAAP reported earnings for the quarter were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the second quarter of last year. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of this year. The second quarter of last year included $0.10 per share from a gain on the sale of Spectrum, so on an adjusted basis EPS growth was 14.3%. Adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter excluding this prior-year gain was 6%. Through the first half of the year, earnings totaled $2.06 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would've been about $0.07 higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate for the first half of this year was 12.6%. Beginning this quarter, we are reporting Wireless equipment revenue and Wireless cost of equipment in our consolidated statements of income. In our Wireless segment, we are reporting the cost of equipment and the cost of service, which were previously combined as cost of service and sales. Prior period detail at both the consolidated and Wireless segment level is included in the financial and operating information schedules on our website. I would also remind you that our Wireline results include the operations that we agreed to sell to Frontier. This will be the case until the transaction closes, which is on track for the first half of 2016. As we pointed out last quarter, the assets and liabilities associated with these operations have been classified on the balance sheet as held for sale, and as such, we are no longer recording depreciation expense. For the full year, we continue to estimate the earnings benefit to be about $0.12 to $0.13 per share. The acquisition of AOL, which we announced in mid-May closed on June 23. Our balance sheet at June 30 includes the AOL assets and liabilities. Our income statement for the second quarter does not reflect any results of AOL operations for the last seven days of the month due to immateriality. The AOL results of operations will be fully included in the third quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to compete effectively and execute our strategy, which is focused on providing consistent network reliability and a great customer experience. Once again we delivered strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investment provides the foundation for innovative products and services for future profitable growth. We are committed to building the business for the future through a disciplined capital allocation model that we outlined almost two years ago and continue to execute. Through the first half of this year we have invested approximately $18 billion in Spectrum licenses and capital for future network capacity. We also invested more than $4 billion to acquire new capabilities with the AOL transaction, which supports our long-term video strategy. In addition, we returned more than $9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. The $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program was completed in early June, resulting in an overall reduction of 101.6 million shares. We facilitated these initiatives while keeping our leverage ratio essentially unchanged and remaining on track with our deleverage plan. On the execution front, we had a strong quarter of quality connections growth and profitability in Wireless. We had more than 1.1 million retail postpaid net adds, which included 321,000 net phone additions. We also had very strong customer retention with postpaid churn of 0.90%, down four basis points year-over-year. This was our lowest churn rate in three years. Total Wireless revenue grew 5.3% and EBITDA increased by 9.1%. Our EBITDA margin on both service and total Wireless revenue expanded on a year-over-year basis. Our Wireline results were once again highlighted by growth in the consumer market, where revenues were up over 4%. Our segment EBITDA margin expanded modestly on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Now, let's get into our second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. Total operating revenue was $32.2 billion in the quarter, and if we exclude the prior-period revenues from the public sector business we sold last year, the comparable growth rate would've been 2.8%. Consolidated top line revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS usage. We believe that future revenue growth will come from video and the Internet of Things at both the network and platform layers. Over the past several years we have been investing in these platforms and positioning ourselves to capitalize on these new sources of growth. In terms of video, we will introduce our mobile-first OTT video product in late summer. As you know, we have already announced some initial content partners. Our acquisition of AOL further enhances our video strategy through its digital media and advertising platform capabilities, a portfolio of content brands with a domestic average of about 190 million unique visitors per month, and its loyal e-mail subscription customer base. We are excited to have the very talented people of AOL on the Verizon team and look forward to their contributions to our success. As far as Internet of Things, we think that the transportation, healthcare, and energy industries in particular present great opportunities for us and we are very active fostering innovation in these areas. We are very well-positioned to capitalize on these new growth opportunities and we will continue to develop business models to monetize usage on our network and at the platform level. Within our current results, new revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. These revenues totaled approximately $165 million in the quarter and about $320 million year-to-date. We continue to be focused on reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies while improving the overall customer experience. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.8 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points to 36.6%. Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide five. As highlighted a few minutes ago, our capital allocation model is disciplined and consistent. The priorities are to invest necessary capital in our networks to stay ahead of demand, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. The cash flows we generate enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and deleverage to further strengthen the balance sheet. In the second quarter, cash flows from operations were $8.7 billion. Through the first half, cash flow from operations totaled $18.9 billion but included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring. We also continue to securitize wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $1.2 billion in cash proceeds in the second quarter. Free cash flow for the first half of the year excluding the tower proceeds totaled $8.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $8.2 billion for the first half of the year. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of gross debt, net debt of $110.7 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 times. As I said earlier, our deleveraging plans remain on track. Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide six. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. As I said earlier, total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.3% in the quarter to $22.6 billion. Service revenue of $17.7 billion declined 2.2% while equipment revenue increased to $3.9 billion, up nearly 62%. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3%. For customers who select device installment plans, lower service pricing is exchanged for higher device payments. Equipment revenue, which is largely recognized upfront, is much higher than in the subsidy model. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more customers choose unsubsidized devices, and equipment revenues will continue to increase with installment plan adoption. Customer demand for device installment plans has increased. The percentage of phone activations on installments grew to 49% in the quarter compared with 39% in the first quarter and only 18% a year ago. Phone activations on device installment plans totaled $4.7 million in the quarter, and we now have more than 14 million customers on these plans, representing roughly 16% of our postpaid phone base. Looking ahead, we believe that the percentage of phone activations on installment will continue to increase and will likely be around 60% in the third quarter. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.1%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.1%, up 580 basis points. The EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue expanded to 43.9% in the quarter, up from 42.3% a year ago. Now, let's turn to slide seven and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 109.5 million total retail connections. This does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.2% to 103.7 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.8 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 3.9 million but were down year-over-year due primarily to lower tablet volumes. As I highlighted earlier, we had a very strong customer retention in the quarter with postpaid churn improving both sequentially and year-over-year to 0.90%. One of our priorities this year was to improve customer retention and we are doing so with a disciplined approach focusing on high value customers. Our retail postpaid net additions of more than 1.1 million were nearly twice the net additions in the first quarter. The quality of the net adds remained very strong with 842,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter. Postpaid phone additions totaled 321,000 as net phone adds of 588,000 were partially offset by a net decline of 266,000 basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 852,000 in the quarter and net prepaid devices declined by 126,000. Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on slide eight. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 2%. About 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 70.1 million smartphones in total and our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 81% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 73% of our retail postpaid connections base. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage. Approximately 87% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network and overall traffic on LTE has essentially doubled in the past year. About 7.2% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. The quality of our phone base continues to improve as we add new 4G customers and upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices as part of our retention efforts. In the past year, our 4G smartphone connections have increased by 17.8 million or about 40% to 61.6 million. We still have a sizable opportunity remaining with roughly 16 million basic phones and about 9 million 3G smartphones in our postpaid connections base. We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets as they provide good value through increased data consumption and lower churn rate at the account level. We ended the quarter with 9.6 million tablets in our postpaid connections base, so overall penetration is still under 10%. In terms of capital spending, we continue investing for the capacity to further optimize our 4G LTE network and position the network for the future. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter and $5.5 billion for the first half of the year, about 4% higher on a year-to-date basis. National studies consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance. Currently, our 700 MHz and AWS-1 spectrum bands, which represent approximately 40% of our license spectrum portfolio are utilized in our LTE network. We are just beginning to reform 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G to 4G LTE in select markets representing the next phase of spectrum to be deployed to serve our growing LTE usage. Our network densification plans, which includes small cells, DAS nodes and in-building solutions are on schedule. In New York City we are well into our deployment and continue to scale and develop a healthy pipeline. Downtown Chicago is another large urban market with small cell densification plans well underway consistent with what we outlined on our post-auction conference call. Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide nine. In the consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of our positive revenue trends resulting in revenue growth of 4.5%. Mass markets which includes Small Business, grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 79% of consumer revenue. In the second quarter FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8% driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and higher pay-per-view sales due to the prize fight in early May. Our FiOS Quantum broadband service continues to scale and with a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 64% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speed tier where 23% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. In broadband we added 72,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.8 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.4% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 25,000 in the quarter. In FiOS Video, we added 26,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.7% penetration. We had strong customer interest in our Custom TV offering. More than one third of our FiOS video gross adds this quarter opted for a Custom TV package. And we also saw a migration demand from existing customers. We will continue to work with content providers on this new product, which so far is ahead of our expectations. While adoption of Custom TV may initially have a negative impact on revenue growth, it should improve profitability. In the second quarter, we experienced a slowing of FiOS customer growth, which we attribute to triple play offer changes at a time of increased competitive intensity. We have since made some promotional adjustments and our exit rate sales volumes have shown improvement. We are focused on the continued evolution of our Wireline network. In the second quarter, we converted 51,000 copper customers bringing our first half total to 98,000. As I have previously noted post-conversion, we experienced significant improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. Our agreement with Frontier for the sale of Wireline assets in the non-contiguous states of Florida, Texas, and California is also part of our network evolution as it will enable us to better focus our efforts on the highly dense markets in the Northeast. We are working closely with Frontier to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and assure a seamless transition. We are making progress and remain on track to close the transaction in the first half of 2016. Let's turn to slide 10 and cover Enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the second quarter lower Enterprise revenue declined 6.4%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure the revenue decline was similar to the first quarter. Declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continued to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.5% in the second quarter, which was better than expected due to some nonrecurring items. We expect continued price compression, technology migration, and other secular challenges to pressure wholesale revenues, which we expect to decline in the 5% to 6% range for the full year. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.2%, which included some FX pressure. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, up 10 basis points. We are very committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The Wireline head count was down 10% year-over-year, and we continue to strive for gains in operational efficiency. As I said, we are far from satisfied and we will continue to work on our cost structure. Capital spending in the Wireline for the first half of the year totaled $2.2 billion, down 19%. Let's move next to our summary slide. We've had a good first half of 2015 delivering strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. As always, we continue to invest in our networks and platforms to position us for future growth. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our acquisition of AOL will be a key piece in our over-the-top mobile video strategy, accelerating our capabilities in digital media and advertising. We are confident in our ability to sustain profitability. Consolidated EBITDA for the first half of the year was up nearly 6% on an adjusted basis and our EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 37%. In terms of consolidated revenue outlook, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be higher than this quarter. For the full year, our consolidated revenue guidance is for growth of at least 3%. These growth estimates exclude revenue from AOL, which will become part of our results in the third quarter. We continue to target overall capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Fran. Marley, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two, if I could. Fran, could you kind of give us a little bit more color on the change in the revenue guidance for the year? Obviously what's different between when you were expecting 4% versus 3%? And then obviously what the moving parts are to get accelerated revenue growth in the second half? And then I think the second question would be, for the markets reacting to something today, I think it's the sequential movement in the ARPA or the ARPU. And obviously there's lots of moving parts in there. There's the impact of EIP. There is the impact of mix change. But I think the market is also trying to see through those and figure out what the net movement is in terms of people pricing themselves up in the buckets and generating more ARPU versus some of the givebacks and the competitive pressure we are seeing inside the system at Verizon. If you could give us more color on how the net is moving on pricing inside the base, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Good. Thanks, David. So at first on the revenue guidance. So, look, I mean coming into this year we set a priority that we said we would protect our base, and I think if you look at the results of the first quarter and the second quarter, the churn speaks for itself, with four basis points improvement from the first quarter year-over-year and then the second quarter year-over-year with the 0.90% being the lowest churn rate in the last three years that we posted up. In addition, some of the other changes in the assumption fact is the take rate of Edge. I would tell you we never anticipated that Edge would accelerate as much as it has, and looking forward into 3Q being at 60%, that's much higher than we had anticipated but the market has moved us there. And quite honestly it's getting more and more confusing at the frontline so this really translates into simplicity for our customers in choosing the Edge plan, and that's where the market has gone, so that's where we need to compete. And then finally, from an upgrade perspective, going back to protection of our base, we're up 800,000 upgrades year-over-year. So more people are selecting the new price plans when they get a new handset, and that puts us on the Edge which obviously generates more equipment revenue and puts pressure on the service revenue. And coming into this year we knew that service revenue would dilute. We're seeing more dilution than we anticipated because more customers are selecting that Edge plan. But I think just a couple of things to keep in check here, because when you zero in on one metric, you're walking away with the wrong impression as to what's happening in the overall P&L. So first off, we generated growth in revenue of 5.3% in Wireless this quarter. So if you look at the first half of the year, that's $2.5 billion of revenue growth just in the first half. You annualize that, that's growth that's bigger than some Fortune 500 companies generate in the full year of revenue. So this is still a very healthy business and it goes to what the overall industry is as well. So there's a lot going on in the industry to generate more usage in the future. So if you look at the IARPA which is the installment plus the revenue per account we're up 2.3%. So if you just focus in on the service revenue, of course that's going to dilute year-over-year, but I think you have to step up and look at the overall financials of Verizon Wireless. In addition, if you look at the connections, we're up 4.3% year-over-year in connections and we're also up in accounts. So when you look out to the future you're adding accounts, you're adding devices, that's also going to be more usage on the network. And obviously the whole future of the industry is based on generating more usage on the network so that people want to use more. And we know from a fact that more people are consuming more video on wireless today than they were a year ago. So that's all part of the strategy. You look at tablets, we're still less than 10% of the base in penetration of tablets. That's still another growth area for us. Then you look at Internet of Things. Internet of Things is still in early stages for the entire industry. There is more and more devices coming out that's going to generate revenue in the future. And then of course, if you just look at Verizon, we have the whole AOL and OTT launch, which we'll get to. We just launched Custom TV in Wireline, and that in itself will also put pressure on the top line. So if you think about the Custom TV package, customers are now only paying for what they want to view, and we're only paying the content providers for what our customers want to view. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a decrease in revenue, but you're also seeing a decrease in content cost that actually improves the profitability. So again, I think if you step back and you look at the entire portfolio of what's going on, I think you walk away with a very different conclusion than if you just look at the ARPU because we know that ARPU is going to get condensed with the new EIP plan. So thanks, David, for the question.\nDavid W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Fran, you talked a bit about productivity and cost initiatives earlier. Can you just update us on the steps you're taking to offset the dilution from the divestiture to Frontier next year? And perhaps in the context of that you can just update us on the union negotiations? I guess that deadline's coming up here shortly. Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks, Simon. So on productivity and cost, look I mean we've been at this now for three years and our VLSS program, Verizon Lean Six Sigma program continues to generate savings. I mean if you just look at Wireline year-over-year down almost 8,000 employees from a year-over-year basis and still generating the great customer service and the volumes that we have there. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're getting both in the network efficiency side, reduction of over time, and of course as the industry matures now you're looking a lot of houses that already have an ONT on the side of the house. So it's less labor because you're just activating the house that now doesn't really need much of a truck roll to go to it. So there's a lot of efficiency there. In the Wireless side, a lot of concentration around self-serve and customer service centers. And then we go to structure around the Wireless unit. So we're still on that whole productivity cost routine and we still believe that we have a very full runway in front of us and you're going to continue to see us take cost out of this structure. If you just look at year-over-year on cash cost alone, if you look at our revenue growth versus cash cost we're really maintaining cash cost at a very slow incremental increase. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're driving through all of our initiatives. On the Frontier side we still have \u2013 we're expecting to close this transaction towards the end of the first quarter. So we still have about 8 months to 9 months of planning activity. We're well on our way, and I think what we've done in the past speaks for itself as how we'll address this in the future, and obviously I'll talk more about this as we get closer. But we are still designing those plans. Obviously you know Dan Mead is leading that team and he is very diligent in what he's doing to prepare us for the separation of that unit and getting our cost within alignment to offset the stranded cost perspective. On the union side of the house, just as we know there are in total 27 collective bargaining agreements covering about 38,000 people in nine Eastern states. We began formal negotiations on June 22 and to jump start the negotiations, the company put forth a comprehensive offer on the table, which included wage increases and changes to current contracts to help us manage our cost and increase our flexibility to better serve our customers. Simply stated, we will need to monetize at our legacy contracts to better position us to compete in the digital age. Given the level of change we are seeking with respect to benefit cost management as well as work rules, our expectation is that the negotiation process will take some time. As you know, it is not unusual for negotiations to continue well beyond the expiration date of the contract, which is August 1. We intend to work through the process until we achieve a new agreement that addresses the needs of our business and preserves the high quality of our jobs for our employees. So I think, David (sic) [Simon], as far as that goes, that's probably all I'm going to say around the union negotiations. It's early on and we still have a lot of work to do.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Marley, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. I guess, Fran, if you could start on expanding on Custom TV, any update on discussions with programmers there? And are people sort of \u2013 it seems like people are taking smaller packages than they would've otherwise. What's the average number of add-ons and any particular favorites that people are either walking away from or going to? And then second, just a housekeeping issue. I wonder if you can detail for us the impact of AOL on the P&L, just sort of rough numbers on the different areas and how you're going to report that going forward. Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks, Phil. So on Custom TV, I mean obviously we know we were paving the path for a new venture here to give customers what they wanted. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on any litigation matters currently in effect with Disney and ESPN as everyone knows that we're being sued on the contractual arrangement there. So I'm really not going to talk about that. But look, I mean we continue to have a great partnership with Disney and ESPN and we will continue to work through that disagreement in our business relationships. And I will tell you, if you just look at the over-the-top product, I mean ESPN is participating with college sports in that product. So we will continue to work with ESPN and the lawsuit will take its own course of action. And again, we believe we're in our contractual rights to offer what we're offering. From a customer selection perspective, I will tell you this has certainly exceeded our expectations. As we saw through the quarter once we launched this, we saw the uptake rate increase. As I said in my prepared remarks, over a third of the customers now coming in are selecting a Custom TV package. I will tell you that as far as the number of genres that they take, it's less than what we anticipated but they are selecting based on their own favorability and I'm not going to get into who selects what and how many we're doing there. But I will tell you that it is, it will put pressure on the top line but it obviously is going to improve our profitability here from a programming standpoint. So we will continue to work through that. The other thing I wanted to mention on just the growth metrics of FiOS here. As you know, given the disputes that we had in Custom TV, we also were blacked out from many content providers in advertising this product during the quarter. And in two of the biggest markets, both New York and Philadelphia, we were unable to advertise the Custom TV package for approximately 45 days until we worked through that. So that also contributed to some of the slower growth in FiOS because it took us out of market for that period of time during the quarter. And then of course in addition to that we had the Time Warner Cable separation of the merger, which both entrants came back into the market pretty competitively. So that put some pressure on this as well but even with that, we saw some great progress with the Custom TV package. On the second piece Phil of AOL, there is nothing included in AOL from a P&L perspective this quarter. We closed it at the end of the quarter. It was totally immaterial and from a cut off perspective it just wasn't materially enough for us to include. However, we did include the opening balance sheet. We've done a preliminary assessment on the fair value of the assets that we acquired. We had an independent third-party do that on a preliminary basis, and that is included in the balance sheet. So you'll see goodwill has increased for the acquisition as well as our customer list because there was value assigned to the subscription business of AOL. But from a P&L standpoint, there was no revenue or expenses included this quarter. That will be included for the first time in the third quarter and at this point, we will be including that in our overall corporate results for the remainder of this year. And then as I said before, we'll have to wait to see where we go with this \u2013 whether we include it as a separate viewable or we disclose revenues or how we're going to do that in the future, and I don't have an answer yet on that piece. So we'll wait till first quarter and entering into 2016 to give you more of a view into what happens going forward.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Marley, next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, and thanks for the comments on the retention efforts. Just as a follow-up to that, you've seen your churn rate in postpaid decline year-over-year for two quarters now. Do you have conviction you're going to be able to see your churn rate sort of stay at a low run rate for the balance of the year in light of your focus on it? And then just you noted that you are still planning on launching the mobile video service this summer. Are we going to see the full rollout this summer or is it going to be something that's going to be phased in over time and just along those lines, where are you with the adoption or the penetration of your multi-cast devices? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks, Brett. So look, first on churn. We've made, as I said coming into this year we were really going to concentrate on protection of our base and I think we've shown that. If you just look at, and we don't really disclose this but if you just look at our basic churn rate, we've seen even double what we've seen in the overall churn rate improvement, so we are maintaining those basic phone customers and converting them into a 4G LTE smartphone device and we're seeing really good progress on that. And that's part of the $80 price point that we have in the market. It's been very, very successful for us in the retention of our customer base. But speaking on the churn piece, I just want to caution everybody, be careful because there is seasonality in the churn. So generally third quarter is a little bit higher than the second quarter but we do believe that we will still be able to improve on a year-over-year basis. As far as the over-the-top launch, we are absolutely going to be ready to go by late summer. It won't be the full entire of everything that we contemplate within the product set. It'll be an initial launch and as the year goes on, it will progress. So more to come on that but as you know, we have signed up a number of content providers, sports channels, DreamWorks, AwesomenessTV, Vice Media, Scripps, and of course we can't leave out the AOL content that's coming with the acquisition including HuffPost and TechCrunch. So we have a very good lineup. This is a lineup that is really around all live type news clips and sports and events, so very different than what anyone else is bringing to the marketplace. So more to come on that this summer from Marni and Tim Armstrong and his team who now owns this product set. And then on the multicast, again, as we go through this, all the phones that we sold in the fourth quarter have the capability of multicast other than the 6 and the 6 Plus, and we continue to feed the market with those multicast devices and I can't speak to exactly what the next iconic device will have in it so we'll have to wait to see what that comes out with but this will continue to grow over the next year to have a proliferation of units in the marketplace to make this matter as we continue on with our OTT launch.\nBrett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the color.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question please, Marley.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Two questions for me. Fran, first just a housekeeping item. I'm wondering if you could disclose the receivable amount for the equipment installment plan that you sold, both current and noncurrent at the end of the second quarter. And then more strategically, can you talk about how important the Wireline business is for the health and profitability of your Wireless business and how important it is or isn't to keep those two businesses together over time? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Michael. So first off on the receivable, we're fairly flat because keep in mind that we continue to securitize the receivable that removes that receivable from our books. So it's consistently flat between $2.5 billion to $3 billion so it really hasn't changed much. On the overall Wireline perspective, look, I mean, we've sold the three properties in the South, Texas, California and Florida because they were islands to us, very difficult properties to operate from our scale perspective. There's still a lot of copper in those footprints and Frontier does a much better job with that and strategically it just didn't fit for us. But, look, I think if anyone was to enter the broadband market the East Coast would be the first place that they would go. I mean we have an incredible footprint that stretches from Washington DC up through Boston. The broadband connection to those homes along with our Wireless product and the population of that segment is critical to us and it is a strategic asset for us to continue to market and launch with our Wireless product and over the top is going to feed into more of that as we go in here strategically. So right now, Lowell and I sit and we're very satisfied with the portfolio of assets we have. From an enterprise space, that enterprise asset is very critical to our enterprise customers, both from a Wireless and a Wireline perspective, so they're important relationships to us. So right now, I mean I'm not saying that if someone didn't come in and take a look at the assets \u2013 as we've always said, we're open to anything. But right now, strategically we are very satisfied with the asset portfolio we have and it's strategic to us. So right now we're content with what we have.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, maybe just a quick comment on margin pacing throughout the year now that we have more Edge uptake, just how we should be thinking about that typical fourth quarter seasonality? Second, on the Wireless side, anything on your radar with respect to leasing plans? And then just finally on the enterprise piece, I know you mentioned pricing and the competition there. Just trying to get a sense for, is there something going on that's incredibly irrational? Or is it just a byproduct, more competitive in certain areas? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks. So, Mike, on the margin pricing, look I think that the financials speak for themselves and of course we'll get a lot of flavor around how EIP helped the profitability and all this. Bit again, as Mike and I have continued to say, if you look at total revenue and the total EBITDA margin, that kind of neutralizes out the impact of the EIP and you see that we're increasing this year-over-year. And even if you look at Wireless margin at 56% in this quarter, even if you normalize out the EIP benefit, you're still over 50% margins for that business. So I think it speaks to itself of the \u2013 we continue to be an \"and\" company. We're going to grow and we're going to generate the profitability and we're going to do this in a very disciplined manageable approach. And we've said that we felt that coming into the year that we would hold our margins given all the competitive pressures, and we're still on track to do that. So I think the margin itself speaks for itself. And from a seasonality standpoint the one thing I would say going back to the change in the revenue guidance is, as we look out into the fourth quarter, keep in mind fourth quarter last year was an unusually very high volume quarter that generated a lot of equipment revenue, and the bulk of our sales were still in the equipment subsidy model. And that hovered around the new 6 and 6 Plus that came out. I just don't see that the next iconic device is going to be substantially different and therefore, I don't see that \u2013 and this is just me speaking, I don't see the volume there in the fourth quarter that we had last year from a total iconic change of the 6 and the 6 Plus. So I think that will also benefit us from just a margin perspective. On Wireless and leasing plans, look this is \u2013 the leasing plan is just a fancy way to do installment plans. But of course you get another accounting benefit by putting assets up on your books and being able to amortize them below the EBITDA line. So at this point, we have no plans to do any type of leasing arrangement. And then on the enterprise side, look, as I've said before, 2015 would look like 2014. I still do see some glimmers of hope here especially in the government sector where we're starting to sign some large contracts. But as you know in this business, I sign a large contract today, it takes me at least 12 months to implement that before I start to see the revenue benefit. So I'm looking that there could be some positives here going into 2016 on the enterprise side. Obviously it's being impacted by FX right now. But this is a very competitive environment with thousands of players who have niches. We do very well on the security side of the house. We're doing well in the data center side on the whole cloud services. But these revenue streams are just not large enough to offset the price compression that we're seeing in IP. But again, I see some glimmers of hope in IP, where maybe it's starting to stabilize again and if that happens then we should see some improvement. But right now it would be a cautious outlook from me.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. First on the Edge take rate, Fran, how high can this go over time? You gave the guidance for 60% next quarter but do you see a time where in the not-too-distant future you could phase out subsidized plans and move all towards these Edge plans? And then the other number that stuck out was the lower churn. You talked about some of the efforts to lower churn. Do you think you can maintain this level of sort of below 1% going forward? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, John. So on the Edge take rate, look, I mean this is where the market has gone. If you look at all the advertising in the market, it's around the access point, and this is where we're at. So I think that where we're going to end up here is you'll never get to 100% overall because of corporate accounts and so forth. They're not going to take an installment type plan. So I don't think we ever get to \"100%\" in our base. But from a consumer standpoint, yes, I could see us getting to where we're more heavily, very heavily concentrated on the installment side of the house, and quite honestly as I said from a frontline perspective it'd be much easier for them to just sell one product. So simplicity is important to us. So you're going to see us, as we gradually move through here, that the market is moving us there so we're eventually going to get there. From a churn perspective as I said, I think with all the programs we have going, we're making very good progress in our base. Our customers are loyal. You've seen us running our new ads and some of our customers are coming back to us because they were dissatisfied with where they went. So I think that this all proves to again, the basis of how Verizon Wireless has been successful and will continue to be successful is the quality of our network, the consistent performance that our network gives to our customers, and the breadth of that network across the United States. So that's really what it comes to and as I've said before, the number one reason a customer leaves you is because of quality of the network, price is number two. So the quality of the network still is overwhelmingly more important than price, not to say that customers are not price-sensitive but we think that we can continue to be very competitive and protect our high-value-base. So yes, I do think that we'll continue on this track.\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Marley, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good morning folks. I'm wondering if we could switch gears a little bit in terms of the network investment strategy here, Fran. We start to hear things coming out of Washington \u2013 600 megahertz seems to be like pushing for early 2016 start. First of all, how do you think about the timing on the reality of that happening and how should we think about your strategy around the need for low band spectrum? And then sort of a bigger picture question here, I mean, clearly focus remains on providing a compelling network experience from your side particularly if I think about your CapEx investment and shifting towards Wireless. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about some of the technology evolutions that you folks are embracing. Clearly when we speak to folks sort of in the push to small cells perhaps some of the software defined networking at (51:35) which we haven't seen from any other players, and stuff along those lines to really try and optimize the network throughput, any additional color would be most helpful here?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So thanks, Amir. So on the networks side as far as the incentive auction goes, yeah, the FCC is now saying that they're going to hold the auction first quarter of 2016, probably at the end of the first quarter of 2016. As you know, they had a meeting on July 16 where they were going to set the rules but that actually got postponed. So we'll have to wait to look at what the auction rules are and decide whether we're going to participate at the appropriate time. The only thing I would say is based on the AWS-3 auction, hopefully the \u2013 we have some lessons learned on what we shouldn't do with a multi-billion-dollar companies giving favorable treatment so we'll have to see where these assessments come out. As far as our strategy here, the need for low-band spectrum for us is not a great need. As you know, we build out our LTE on the 700 megahertz which is contiguous across the United States, which is a competitive advantage for us. We then launched our AWS-1 spectrum for capacity and now we're in the process of revamping our 1900 PCS. So the key here is to keep in mind that of our licensed portfolio, only 40% of our licensed portfolio supports LTE and 87% of the data traffic is now running through LTE. So if you look at our 1900 megahertz, the yet to be deployed AWS-3 which we bought and will be deployed over the next probably 2.5 years out and then our build strategy, which we came out of the auction within Chicago and New York, we have plenty of capacity to deal with the ramping of what we believe will happen with our OTT product and the continued pursuit of volume in the industry. So our buildout is on track. We do not necessarily need low band spectrum but that doesn't mean that we would not participate in the incentive auction. Again, we'll have to wait for the rules to come out but obviously we are continuing down the track that we set on coming out of the AWS-3 auction. So at that point we'll have to wait to see what happens with the FCC.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Amir, thank you. Marley, we have time for one more question and if you could queue that up, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nJennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, Fran. Following up on Amir's question on spectrum, in the past you have said you would consider a longer-term lease agreement with a potential partner. Is that still the case? Or given your recent comments just now about capacity, what are your current thoughts on any sort of longer-term lease agreement?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah thanks, Jennifer. Well, I always say you never say never, right? So look \u2013 I mean, we're open to any options, but as far as the leasing of spectrum goes, as I said before, in order to protect the viability of our network and our planning and our capital allocation, this would have to be almost a lease in perpetuity so that you could never be held hostage by anybody because once you deploy a spectrum in your network, if somebody turned around 10 years from now and said, I think I'm not going to lease that to you any more, that would be detrimental to your business, and you can't just \u2013 you just can't let that happen. So I guess under the right terms, and conditions it would be something that we could look at, but I would tell you I think that's very, very difficult given the asset that you're leasing here. So I think that's the perspective, and we're concentrating on our build. The one thing I didn't answer on Amir's question was SDN, and we're into that. I mean, obviously, LTE in itself is a software-developed network and it gives you the scalability of giving richer network experiences, and our team is working on that and we've been working on that for quite some time. So there's a lot of things that will bring efficiency to the network. I mean, there's CRAN out there. We are in the initial \u2013 obviously 5G is being talked about in the industry, of course Asia is involved in 5G and of course we will start to get involved in the standard-setting around 5G. So there's a lot happening in this industry from a technology standpoint, so spectrum's important, it will always be important, but it's not the only tool we have in our toolbox. So from that perspective, we're concentrating on that strategy that we outlined coming out of the AWS-3 auction.\nJennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Hey, Marley, thank you, but before we end the call I'd like to turn the call back to Fran for some final comments.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Thanks, everybody, and again thank you for joining us this morning. I'd just like to end though at, through the first half of 2015 we continue to execute on the fundamentals, we position our business for the future and we always return value to our shareholders. On a comparable basis, first half's consolidated revenues grew 3.5%, earnings grew 12.6%, cash flow from our operations was up 11.9%, Wireless revenues increased over $2.5 billion to just under $45 billion. We positioned ourselves for future growth, we acquired valuable mid-band spectrum in the FCC auction, invested $8 billion in capital year-to-date and made a very strategic acquisition in AOL. AOL acquisition greatly accelerates our digital media and advertising platform capabilities, which will become a critical element of our OTT strategy and our revenue growth for the future. We returned $9 billion to our shareholders through the first half of this year, $4 billion in dividends and $5 billion in an ASR program. We certainly look forward to a very positive second half of 2015 with confidence and our ability to execute our strategy and create value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. Thank you again for joining us today, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran goes through our results, I would like to highlight a few items related to our earnings. GAAP reported earnings were $1.02 per share. And there were no special items of a non-operational nature. This compares with adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 21.4%. As a reminder, the adjusted EPS of $0.84 last year did not reflect a 100% ownership of wireless for the full quarter since the Vodafone transaction closed on February 21, 2014. As we indicated a year ago on a non-GAAP illustrative basis, adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $0.91 per share if we assumed 100% wireless ownership for the full quarter. On this more comparable basis, growth in the first quarter earnings per share was 12.1%. I would also like to make a few points about our wireline segment reporting. Our wireline results include the operations we are selling to Frontier until the transaction closes, which is targeted for the first half of 2016. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities associated with those operations as being held for sale. This is important because accounting rules require that depreciation expense not be recorded on assets held for sale. Therefore, wireline depreciation expense will be lower in 2015 due to the classification of these assets. The first quarter included a $146 million pre-tax benefit, which equates to roughly $0.02 per share. Going forward, until closing, the full quarter benefit will be approximately $200 million pre-tax or $0.03 per share. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFran Shammo: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015 with an eventful first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth. We delivered very strong financial and operating results in the first quarter with strong cash generation. To review our active start to the year, we were successful in the AWS-3 spectrum auction improving our mid-band spectrum position while maintaining sound financial discipline. As we stated on our conference call in mid-February, we are very pleased with the licenses we won and are confident that they will enable us to execute efficiently on our network strategy of adding capacity through a combination of spectrum deployment and small cell technology. Our early experiences with small cell deployments have been very favorable and we believe that the industry is making good progress on standards for utilizing unlicensed spectrum with LTE, which is already being tested in our vendor labs. We also executed several value creating transactions that underline our commitment to extend our industry leadership in the markets we serve by being strategically focused and returning value to shareholders. We successfully monetized our tower portfolio in a $5 billion transaction with American Tower, which closed at the end of the first quarter. We signed a definitive agreement to sell our wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California to Frontier for $10.5 billion. And we implemented a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an immediate reduction of about 86 million shares in mid-February. Final settlement of this transaction, including delivery of the remaining shares that we expect to receive is scheduled to occur in the second quarter. Collectively, these transactions provide immediate value for shareholders. Now, let\u2019s move on to our primary focus which is executing our day to day strategy for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our first quarter results reflect strong top and bottom line performance. We posted solid revenue growth, high quality earnings growth of 12% and generated substantial free cash flow. In wireless, we had a solid quarter of quality connections growth and profitability. We had 565,000 retail postpaid net adds in a seasonally low volume quarter. Total wireless revenue grew 6.9% and EBITDA was up 6.6%. As expected our wireless EBITDA margin returned to more historical levels. In wireline, consumer revenues grew 4% and we continued to increase our FiOS penetration with quality customer growth. Total wireline revenue was impacted by foreign exchange pressure, but our continued focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in EBITDA margin expansion. Now let\u2019s get into the first quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue grew 3.8% in the first quarter continuing our consistent top line growth trend. If we excluded the first quarter 2014 revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.2%. Our consolidated revenue growth continues to be driven by wireless and FiOS. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. In the first quarter these revenues totaled approximately $150 million, an increase of 25%. We continue to build upon our Internet of Things and video platforms. In particular innovation within the transportation industry presents a great opportunity for us. Through Verizon telematics we are already providing a platform of manufacturer, aftermarket and fleet services through two-way broadband connectivity to vehicle. Additionally, we will be launching Verizon Vehicle, our direct to consumer aftermarket product which modernizes traditional roadside assistance and enhances driver safety and convenience. In terms of video we are on track to launch our mobile first OTT video product this summer and we have already announced some initial content partners. We are excited about these new growth opportunities which you will hear more about during the year. In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on process and operating efficiencies and improving our cost structure. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion in the quarter, up 5.8% and our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points on an adjusted basis to 37.4%. As Mike indicated, we reported $1.02 in earnings per share in the quarter for a comparable growth rate of about 12%. So we are off to a strong start from an earnings perspective. Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Consistent with capital allocation model, we have been executing in the last several years, our priorities are to invest in our networks through capital spending and spectrum acquisitions, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our strong cash flows enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and de-lever the balance sheet. The monetization of our tower portfolio enabled us to execute the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. In the first quarter, cash flows from operations totaled $10.2 billion. This included approximately $2.4 billion related to the tower monetization transaction which is non-recurring. The remaining portion of the $5 billion of cash proceeds is reflected in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement. We also securitized the portion of our wireless equipment installment receivables and received $1.3 billion in cash proceeds during the quarter. Free cash flow excluding the tower proceeds totaled about $4.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in the quarter. Although spending was slightly lower in the first quarter, we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. In wireless we continue investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. In the first quarter, wireless CapEx totaled $2.4 billion. As we have previously stated, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology in building solutions and distributed antenna systems. We are also beginning to refarm our 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G EVDO to 4G LTE in select markets. Despite what others claim about certain network metrics, we are consistently acknowledged as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent performance and continue to be the largest and most reliable 4G LTE network in the nation. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Our financial de-leveraging plan had always assumed the purchase of new spectrum. In the first quarter, we paid the remaining balance of $9.5 billion for the AWS-3 licenses we won in the auction. During the past six months, we have been very active in the debt capital markets managing our maturities and taking advantage of the interest rate environment. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of gross debt, net debt of $109 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 times. We are on track with the plans to de-lever and remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. Now, let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 6. Our wireless strategy is to provide the best customer experience while continuing to invest in our network to stay ahead of accelerating demand and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total wireless operating revenues were $22.3 billion in the first quarter, up 6.9%. Total service revenue of $17.9 billion declined 0.4%. Keep in mind that lower service revenue from Edge customers have shifted to equipment revenue. Service revenue plus Edge installment billings were up 3.1%. During the quarter, customer demand for our Edge equipment installment plan continued to increase. The percentage of phone activations on the Edge program was about 39% compared with about 25% in the fourth quarter. We expect the percentage of phone activations on Edge to increase in the second quarter as we are currently running near 50%. Edge phone activations totaled $3.4 million in the quarter and we now have an Edge phone base of $10 million, representing 11.7% of our postpaid phone base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 55.8%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. As customer acceptance of equipment installment plans evolves and the percentage of Edge adoption increases, equipment revenue is increasing. Therefore, you should look at EBIT margin on total wireless revenue rather than wireless service revenue. On this basis, our EBITDA margin on total wireless revenue was 44.8% in the quarter, which was similar to a year ago. Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with $108.6 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to $102.6 million and our prepaid connections totaled $5.9 million. As expected, first quarter seasonality resulted in lower volumes. Postpaid gross additions were $3.7 million, up 2.3% compared to a year ago. A majority of the gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. Retail postpaid churn improved both sequentially and year-over-year coming in at 1.03% for the quarter. We are maintaining a disciplined approach with a focus on retaining high value customers. We are seeing good results with our postpaid smartphone churn less than 0.9% as compared to our basic phone churns at more than 1.2% in the quarter. Our retail postpaid net additions of 565,000 were up 4.8%. The quality of the net adds was very good. We added 621,000 new 4G smartphones and total net smartphones adds were 247,000 in the quarter. We also added 820,000 new 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds were a negative 138,000 as the smartphone adds were more than offset by a net decline of 385,000 basic phones. Additionally net prepaid devices declined by 188,000 in the quarter. Let\u2019s now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 10.3 million in the quarter, up 4.4%. About 84% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 68.7 million smartphones in total, about 85% of which were 4G. Our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 80% of total phones. 4G devices now comprised approximately 70% of our retail postpaid connection space. About 86% of total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network. As you would expect growth in 4G device adoption continued to drive increased data and video usage. Within More Everything accounts average data usage continues to rise, up 54% year-over-year. This is beneficial to us because increasing consumption of content will ultimately drive higher revenue with a lower cost to serve due to the efficiency of our LTE network. In terms of our upgrade rate about 6.5% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter. This represents a sharp sequential decline in the percentage of customers upgrading which was expected due to seasonality and the extraordinary volumes we experienced in the fourth quarter. We continue to have an opportunity to upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices. At the end of the quarter we had roughly 17 million basic phones and about 11 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connection space. We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets. We ended the quarter with about 8.8 million tablets in our postpaid connection space, so overall penetration is still under 10%. Tablets provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the first quarter, consumer revenues were up 4%, representing 11th consecutive quarter of 4% or better growth. Mass markets, which include small business grew 2.9%. FiOS now represents 78% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8% driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and some pricing actions. Our FiOS Quantum broadband service is scaling well and has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 62% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribe to a data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speed tier. We are just over 20% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In broadband we added 133,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.5% penetration. Overall net broadband subscribers increased by 41,000 in the quarter. In FiOS video we added 90,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.7 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 36% penetration. One of the ways we strive to improve the customer value proposition is by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. Last year we introduced quantum TV, Speed Match and our Quantum Gateway router. As part of the evolution of customer choice for video consumption, we just introduced FiOS Custom TV, which have been the last few days. The Custom TV option is a creative approach to the changing landscape allowing customers to better choose the type of content they want to watch. Customers will get a base package of pre-selected and local broadcast channels and choose at least two channel packs out of seven. This new option coupled with our traditional programming packages provides more choice, more control, and more value in an easy self-serve manner. In terms of our ongoing network evolution initiative, we converted about 47,000 Copper customers in the quarter. For the year, we plan to convert a total of 200,000 Copper customers to fiber. We are also in the process of decommissioning 10 central offices. Post conversion, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. These conversions also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services from us. Our focus in 2015 will be to continue adding quality customers driving higher penetration in existing markets and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are highly competitive markets and we will be disciplined and rationale in our approach to customer acquisition. With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline would have been more in line with trends we experienced in the second half of 2014. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications and services. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 3.7% in the first quarter. Healthy demand for Ethernet services continues, but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. We also had a favorable, which improved revenue this quarter and which will not reoccur. Total operating revenues for the entire wireline segment were down 2%, which included the FX pressure. In terms of profitability, the EBITDA margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. Our path to a stronger and more profitable wireline business includes driving further FiOS penetration and continued improvements in operating and capital efficiency. On the enterprise business side, we are changing the revenue mix to higher growth areas like cloud, security and professional services. In terms of our cost structure, we are realizing a number of noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon\u2019s Lean Six Sigma principles. However, we are far from satisfied and we will continue working to improve our overall cost structure. Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. We are off to a strong start to 2015. From a strategic standpoint, we were successful in the spectrum auction, executed a tower portfolio monetization, and signed a definitive agreement to sell certain wireline properties. At the same time, we return value to shareholders with an accelerated share repurchase program. We also delivered strong operating and financial performance with 12% growth in earnings per share on an adjusted basis. Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are on track to achieve our targets of at least 4% consolidated revenue growth, sustained profitability and capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015. Consolidated EBITDA grew by 5.8% and our EBITDA margin expanded to 37.4%. In addition to our ability to deliver strong financial metrics, we are very focused on developing new products and services in the Internet of Things and video. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our de-leveraging plans are on track. And we remain committed to getting back to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so that we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you, Fran. David we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks very much. Good morning Fran. So, you had a couple of management changes in the first quarter, John Stratton taking over as President of Operations and combining the IT and network units, can you give us a little bit of color of any sort of implications, any strategies or anything that has happened as a result of that? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Sure. Thanks Simon. So, as we have moved into our next space as well has consolidated the operational performance under John. This gives us a better breadth of consolidation if you will post the Vodafone acquisition. And if you go back to when we did the acquisition, we stated that there were some internal valves that could be broken down and we could become more efficient. And with the establishment of Marni Walden\u2019s organization around new products and services this is where we are get into the Internet of Things and over the top video she runs Verizon digital media services and some of the other incubation companies we have. So the focus is running the day-to-day operations out of John\u2019s organization and streamlining, implementing Verizon lean six sigma and driving those cost benefits and efficiencies that we are looking for. With Marni\u2019s organization it\u2019s creating the new products and services that we can launch to grow the future of the businesses. And then with Roger and the consolidation of the network and the IT organization, it just makes sense as we move into more software developed network areas and more the network is driven out of data centers it makes sense that Roger would take over the entire thing from an efficiency and consistency of management perspective. So I think what you are seeing here is more well organized within the company, more cohesiveness and more direct relationship between growing revenue and cost reduction.\nSimon Flannery: Okay, great. So no real changes in the sort of cost trajectory or the CapEx trajectory?\nFran Shammo: Well, CapEx we have given you guidance of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. And right now we are staying on track with that. You should see that ramp up through the rest of the year and obviously coming out of the auction we added $500 million to that to densify and build out and that takes a little bit of queuing up time, so you will see that more in the back end of the year. And as far as cost reductions you have seen some of the measures we took at the end of the fourth quarter. If you look at wireline alone, wireline is down over 5,400 people from the beginning of last year. So continuing to streamline that business and become more efficient. And for wireless as John has taken over we are starting to see some streamlining around customer service and some the other things that we have talked about in the past. So I wouldn\u2019t downplay the cost reductions that we will realize in the future here.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks for the color.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay David. Let\u2019s take the next question please.\nOperator: One moment please. Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two if I could, Fran on the quarter, I think the two numbers that really stood out to people were number one, the really low SG&A in wireless, I think going back for a model maybe the lowest percentage of wireless revenue we have ever seen, if you can kind of step us through how we got there from last quarter and what the outlook for that would be, it would be huge. And then the second big number was really the ARPA number, which I think stepped down further than people thought, that could have been related to EIP or it could have been pricing environment in the market or retention efforts that you are executing on, could you kind of give us the picture for how we got to where we got in ARPA and kind of what we can think about that for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks David. Just a clarification here on the wireless revenue you are talking about service revenue?\nDavid Barden: I was actually talking about total revenue as a percentage for SG&A, but either way was a really low number?\nFran Shammo: Okay, yes. So look, I mean I think that if you look at the service revenue and ARPA it all goes to the same issue which is as we start to elevate Edge and we start to increase the take rate of Edge and customers move, you are shifting revenue out of service and into equipment. So you are going to continue to see a decline in service revenue. You are going to continue to see a decline in ARPA, but I think what I would center around is what we said in the script, which was we grew overall revenue by 6.9%. And also if you look at the EBITDA margin which kind of normalizes out the Edge impact, I mean, not 100% of it, but if you look at a dollar of revenue and a dollar of cost there is zero margin. So, if you look at total revenue, 44.8% whereas last year at 44.9%. So, it\u2019s a very consistent profitability measure. The other thing too is if you look at the Edge benefits, you are getting benefits from both lower commissions and so forth, so that is also impacting the SG&A line, because you are indirect before if you think about how that works. We were refunding the indirect through a commission payment for the subsidy of the handset that all goes away. So, you are going to see a decline in the commission expense line, which is impacting the SG&A line. But overall, if you look at the profitability of wireless and I think this is important, if you look at the service margin of 55.8%, if you were to normalize out Edge, the wireless service margin would still have been in that over 50%. So, the profitability of wireless continues to be extremely strong. And again I would go back to what Simon brought up. I would not discount all of the cost reductions and efficiencies that we are creating in the environment.\nDavid Barden: So, this is a good baseline for kind of extrapolating the rest of the year?\nFran Shammo: Well, I mean, from a rest of a year standpoint, I think that the outlook is strong. I think that obviously as Edge continues to escalate, you are going to get some benefit there. We highlighted the depreciation benefit. But I think as far as wireless goes, I think we need to be careful here a little bit, because January normally is a slow promotional, slow seasonal quarter. As you go into the second quarter and you enter into Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day, I would expect that the promotional activity and competitive is going to heat up here. So, that will offset some of the benefits that you are going to see. So, look I think that service revenue and ARPA will continue to decline as the Edge rate takes up, but it\u2019s really about overall revenue growth and the profitability of the business and we feel good about that.\nDavid Barden: Perfect. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, thank you. David, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess first if I can follow-up, Fran on the Edge stuff, can you help us think about the high-end of the Edge mix given the distribution of where you sell this? What portion of your sales are in channels that don\u2019t have access to the Edge program?\nFran Shammo: Well, all of our channels have access to the Edge program, but obviously within our store channel, it is very, very heavily weighted towards Edge at this point. We are doing very little subsidy model selling out of the store channel and it\u2019s because where the market has moved. I mean, when your entire competitive environment is just advertising and promoting service pricing and ignoring the whole equipment side, we have to follow that in order to be competitive. So, the store channel by far is very heavily weighted towards Edge. Indirect is starting to come up as time goes, but also keep in mind the business channel and our enterprise channel are not really taking the Edge product. So, if you are asking me, we will get to 100%, the answer is no. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what that percent will be, but we do see that second quarter will probably be in the neighborhood of a 50% take rate.\nPhil Cusick: Okay. And then second I like the Custom TV launch this morning, there is some controversy around ESPN and Disney, can I ask do you guys have explicit permission for this and have Disney and other pushed back since Friday to you or is this just a storm in the media? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Well, I think the right way to answer this without getting into too public about our contractual situations. Look, this is a product that the consumer wants. It\u2019s all about consumer choice. I mean, if you look at the TV bundles today, most people only on average watch 17 channels. So, this is a way to give consumers what they want on a choice basis. And we believe that we are allowed to offer these packages under our existing contracts. So, we will leave it at that.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Rollins: Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups and then a question. The follow-ups is first, can you just give us the ending net receivable balance for the installment phones and what that was last quarter? And then are you allowing for installment plans early migration on them, is that something you are using to get the take rate of Edge up? And then just a broader question I had if I could is if you could just address the larger strategy for wireline as you went through a quarter of monetizing some additional or announcing the monetization of some additional assets, what\u2019s your thoughts longer term for your wireline business? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks Mike. So, on the accounts receivable, I am not going to get too much detail here on this call, but if you look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter with the securitization that we did it\u2019s relatively flat. On early migration on Edge customers, obviously we have an Edge up feature, but you must pay 75% of the phone off. So, if you decide to pay 75% of your balance off, you can upgrade at any point in time you want. And we do have customers who are taking that and edging up, but there is no \u201cearly migration\u201d other than what\u2019s instituted in the price plan. On the wireline strategy, look I mean if you look at the three properties that we announced to sell Florida, Texas and California, they were more or less islands to us. They were some of the first properties we build out with FiOS. They are heavily penetrated properties. But the majority of those properties are still copper. And as we look at that strategically, when we laid this out, it just made sense based on the offer that Frontier had in front of us to actually sell those properties. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it other than the fact that they were not strategic properties, because they were islands, but if you look at the rest of our wireline footprint from DC all the way up through Boston, it\u2019s very contiguous. It\u2019s highly populated. We have almost 20 million homes passed now with FiOS. So, it\u2019s extremely viable for us to continue to penetrate these properties. And if you look at the penetration rates, New York is still the lowest penetrated market that we have and still has the highest growth opportunity that we have. So, we are holding on to some of the markets that we believe are contiguous. You will see more and more with wireless and wireline combined under John\u2019s leadership. So, there is more that we can do strategically with the footprint that we have and again it just made financial sense to return that back to our shareholder and bring that cash into de-lever the balance sheet. So, that\u2019s really there all is to it, Michael.\nMike Rollins: Thanks very much.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. The smartphone metrics continue to be really impressive. But as you note in the presentation about 20% of your subs still have feature phones, so I was wondering if you could just walk us through what is the strategy for upgrading and retain those subs, particularly because it seems that your competitors are continually targeting that base? And should it be reasonable to think that at this point in the upgrade process, we might continue to see some modest degree of net losses in the phone base whereas what we saw in the first quarter is just a seasonal factor?\nFran Shammo: Thanks, Brett. Well, I guess a couple of things here. So, we still have 17 million basic and 11 million 3G phones and coming out of the fourth quarter, you heard me say that we were going to protect our base. And that was a key ingredient going into the first quarter. And I think with the churn rate you have seen if you look at the basic phone losses on a year-over-year basis, we actually improve that by over 400,000. So last year, we had almost doubled the number of basic phone loss customers than we did this year. And as you notice, we came out with some strong promotional pricing that was targeted towards the basic phone customer and the 3G customer. Now, having said all that, look the environment is, is that there if you look at prepaid on a standalone basis, our prepaid retail pricing is slightly at a premium to some of the other competitors\u2019 postpaid pricing. So, we are in a competitive pricing standpoint. And as I said coming out of the fourth quarter, we will not \u2013 we have to be rationale and we will not chase every customer, but we are making every effort to maintain our base and keep our customers and upgrade them into a price plan that\u2019s fitting for them. And we made improvement in that. But I will tell you we still have some more improvement to do, but we are not satisfied with any losses. But then again, we will not chase every add either, based on just cheap price. So, I think that\u2019s the balanced equation that we showed in the first quarter.\nBrett Feldman: And just a quick follow-up I believe in the past you said some of the small offices you have seen have generally been customers that were not as profitable, is that still the case?\nFran Shammo: Well, I think what I said was if it\u2019s not quite I wouldn\u2019t put it in a profitability perspective, but what I would say is if it\u2019s customer who is just price sensitive and does not care about the quality of the network or is sufficient with just paying a lower price, then that\u2019s probably a customer we are not going to be able to keep on the Verizon wireless network.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike McCormack: Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, maybe if you could just comment regarding subscriber quality, maybe add net add quality or base quality and just thinking about the credit scores within the base, the prime mix and obviously we are seeing a lot of prepaid migration into postpaid is what you guys are seeing with respect to that? And as a follow-up, just a comment if you would on the appetite for additional factoring, how we should be firming that for the full year? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Sure. So, on the securitization piece of the business, yes, you should anticipate that this will be an ongoing program on a quarterly basis going forward. As far as the quality of our base, I think the quality of our base speaks for itself. We have not made any credit policy changes. We have a very strong quality base, but there are a certain segment of our customers as I just discussed around basic, where we are trying to bring them up into a price plan that\u2019s meaningful for them. But if you look at \u2013 again, if you look at the lay of the land around price plans, as I said our prepaid pricing is a little bit of a premium to some other postpaid pricing in the marketplace. And as you saw this quarter, we lost 188,000 prepaid retail customers. I can\u2019t answer specifically where they went, but I would say that they probably made a choice to go to a price \u2013 postpaid price plan, because it\u2019s actually slightly lower on some competitors than it is with us on prepaid. So, I can\u2019t factually state that, but I think that\u2019s some of the migration, but also I would also say that on the reseller side, which we don\u2019t talk much about, we had a very strong growth through our TracFone relationship over 400,000 some net adds this quarter. So, it could have been a migration from retail to wholesale, but I do think there is a migration from the prepaid base into some other postpaid bases and I think others will have to talk to that, but we are not seeing a lot of that within our base.\nMike McCormack: And Fran, just how do you frame the credit risk on these installment plans, I mean, I am assuming you guys obviously have pretty tight credit standards, but if you see this as a risk for you guys on the industry, just I mean more and more loans out there for Apple phones?\nFran Shammo: Well, sure, I mean, obviously it adds risk to the balance sheet, because you are putting up a very large receivable now before it was just service revenue that you are risk add. And if you look at the economics of service revenue, it really is what\u2019s the economic loss to the company really comes down to what\u2019s the actual economic loss of providing the service to the customer. It\u2019s not actually the retail service revenue that\u2019s the loss. So, obviously, the cost of service is minimal. So, the loss was a lot less. Now, you are actually putting up a receivable that has a dollar for dollar loss if the customer does not pay. And again, we are very comfortable with the credit models we use. As I said, we really haven\u2019t changed our credit and we have a very strong credit base. So, I am not \u2013 at this point, I don\u2019t see any trends that will be concerning me on the outstanding receivable at this point.\nMike McCormack: Great. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, thanks. Two quick ones. First, following up on the video tiering, Fran, could you talk a little bit about maybe sort of expected sort of penetration that you expect with these new plans and maybe compare the profitability of these new services to sort of traditional TV subscriptions? And then from Edge standpoint, you have guided to flat consolidated margins for the year, but as you see the higher take rate of Edge and first of all, where that can go for the year, could that drive better wireless margin trends and lead to better overall consolidated margins for the company? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks, John. So, on the video tiers look, I think it\u2019s way, way too early to start talking about what the take rate is or where the profitability. So, we will leave that until we get some trending behind us. Obviously, we have done this because of consumer benefit, give the consumer a better choice. So, let\u2019s see what happens here as we go in and we can address that later. On the EBITDA margins, look I mean I am kind of reiterating our guidance that we came out of the fourth quarter from an outlook perspective. And I think that you have to be cognizant of the fact that this is the first quarter of the year. If you look at last year\u2019s trending as we said coming out of the Vodafone transaction, our earnings profile would be more consistent across the quarters. We wouldn\u2019t be as bumpy as we had been in the past. I think that you have to look at the whole thing in retrospect. And also the other thing is I would not get focused in on the service margins side and as I said I would really prefer as to look at the total margin \u2013 total revenue and the EBITDA margin. And if you saw the EBITDA margin was very, very strong for wirelesses this quarter. And that kind of normalizes out a little bit of what the Edge take rate is. And then again I also can\u2019t speak to what we are in for from a competitive standpoint on additional pricing moves through the year. So, I am kind of reserving on that side of the equation as well from an outlook perspective. So, on outlook and profitability, I would say reiterating what we said in the fourth quarter and more consistent earnings profile moving forward. So, I think that\u2019s where we will leave it.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks Fran.\nMichael Stefanski: David another question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much and good morning Fran and Mike.\nFran Shammo: Good morning Amir.\nMichael Stefanski: Good morning.\nAmir Rozwadowski: You folks highlighted that 4G devices now constitute approximately 70% of the retail postpaid connections and that traffic or LTE network handles about 86% of the total wireless data traffic for the quarter, given these dynamics what seems to be a rapid adoption of LTE technology, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your ability to reform spectrum in order to take advantage of the network efficiency opportunities. Fran you had mentioned that they are continued cost reduction opportunities that your scale provides you and any color there would be helpful?\nFran Shammo: Good. Thanks Amir. Yes. So I think that this is all point to where the future growth of the business comes from. I mean there is not many businesses where consumers want to consume more and more and if you look at it 86% of the usage is on the LTE network. And if you look at our More Everything accounts they are up 54% in consumption year-over-year. So, obviously consumers are willing to consume the content on their wireless devices which is why we were so optimistic around Internet of Things and of course over the top mobile. Now as you start to look at the densification and the efficiency of the network, as I said in my prepared remarks we are already starting to reap on the 1,900 PCS licenses in certain markets and we still have a long way to go there. Also we are looking at as I said the LTE unlicensed which is a really good fit with the licensed LTE piece which will give us a lot more download capability in a managed network comparability. So there is a lot that we can still do around our spectrum and efficiency and obviously with the LTE network as you have seen with 86% of that traffic running on it with a 54% overall year-over-year increase the cost structure of the business really has not changed because the ability to deliver this on a very cost efficient network is there. So I would just continue to say that as we continue to grow on the consumption model what we did in the AWS spectrum in buying the licenses and our plan to build out and densify, I think we are in a very good financial position to execute on that in a very financially disciplined manner and continue to generate the returns that are expected of us.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Great. And then one quick follow-up if I may, you folks have been consistent noting that de-leveraging the balance sheet is the priority for you. And as you mentioned it seems as though the approach you took to the AWS-3 bidding process seems to reflects that strategy, how should we think about your ability or resources available to pursue other assets in the market, specifically I am thinking about the potential broadcast spectrum auction or any material third party portfolios if they were to come to market?\nFran Shammo: I think look I mean we are very focused on our balance sheet and we are committed to de-lever and as we said coming out of the Vodafone transaction we had four priorities. One was to continue to invest in our networks and platforms, which we are, to buy spectrum, which we did to have a competitive dividend payout, which we are and to de-lever the balance sheet. And we will continue to do all that. As far as any type of strategic acquisitions or additional spectrum we are probably alluding to the incentive auction and I think that we are just going to have to wait to see what the rules are before we decide how we are going to execute on or around the incentive auction. So I think that still a little bit ways out before we can make that decision. But look, we have positioned the balance sheet to be able to execute on the strategies that we need to execute on in order to deliver the future growth and earnings of the business. And I think we are in a very, very sound position to do that.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Great. Thank you very much for the color.\nMichael Stefanski: David next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your questions.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Hi, Fran. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about over the top video service offering, I know we are going to see a more formal unveiling this summer, but can you just discuss kind of the news floor, what we should be honing? And two, as you go into that announcement, I mean, I assume it\u2019s more content announcements? And then on the packages you announced last week, should we consider this separate from the OTP or kind of a precursor of this integrated wireline \u2013 wireless model?\nFran Shammo: Okay. So, first on over-the-top video, as we have talked before you see us announcing some of the content deals that are in this, but it goes back to what I said before, this is all around having the consumer consume more content on their wireless handset through the Verizon wireless network. And we know that consumers want one content. We know what the viewership is and this is appealing to mobile content and let\u2019s not confuse that with linear TV content. So, I would not read into the Custom TV package as a precursor to the over-the-top video, it\u2019s not. These are two very distinct ecosystems. As far as the monetization model, when you think about the monetization, there is many different avenues we can do on this. There could be premium subscriptions. There could be pay-per-views using the multicast technology. There can be advertising model so that the consumer does not pay for the content consumption or as others would call sponsored data. So, I think there is lot of models that we can use and I hate to say this, but let\u2019s wait until Marni and team are ready to make the big splash here this summer and then we can have more discussion around what it means.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you very much.\nMichael Stefanski: David, we have time for one more question if we can take the last question please.\nOperator: Your last question today comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nTim Horan: Thanks guys. Fran, the wireless data growth is fairly incredible at this size and base. Do you think you have pricing power for wireless data to your competitors aren\u2019t really charging all that much for? Do you think that will change in the industry as maybe the networks get filled up, your thoughts? Thanks.\nFran Shammo: Well, I think this is the great lead way into the over-the-top mobile. And it\u2019s developing more ecosystems around monetizing the consumption that happens on the network. Obviously, we are in a period of time where we see the service pricing dilution because of the installments out. And I think that will continue. And of course, we are increasing bundles, so more data for the same price, but this is no different, Tim, than what we saw on the voice world way back where we had a price and then all of a sudden everybody started seeing dilution on the minute per minute price, because more minutes were being given away in the bundle and we saw a little bit of access accretion, but overall, pricing was coming down. And then all of a sudden, the usage tracks started up again and revenue took a turn. And I think that\u2019s the piece that we are in with \u2013 right now with the data world, but the key to this is to develop these other ecosystems to create more monetization around customer usage whether that\u2019s premium subscription pay-per-view or advertising models. And that\u2019s really what we are concentrating on.\nTim Horan: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: David, thank you. Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back to Fran for a few closing remarks.\nFran Shammo: Thanks Mike. Thanks for everybody for joining Verizon this morning. We are absolutely off to a good start to the year. We stated coming out of the fourth quarter that we return to historical margin in wireless and we delivered on that. We also stated that we would continue to improve the profitability of our wireline business and we delivered on that. We had a good growth quarter. We had strong profits and strong cash flows. We look forward to a very positive 2015 and we look very hopeful and confident in our ability to execute on our strategy, grow the business profitably, and invest for the future. Thanks everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."}], "2017": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2016, "date": "2017-01-24 14:33:03", "content": "Executives: Michael Stefanski - SVP, IR Matt Ellis - EVP & CFO\nAnalysts: Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Phil Cusick - JPMorgan John Hodulik - UBS David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson Michael Rollins - Citigroup Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Michael McCormack - Jefferies Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to Verizon\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks Tory. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides, including a supplemental information slide, are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Matt goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $1.10 per share and full year earnings of $3.21 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported fourth quarter earnings include a non-cash pre-tax gain of about $1.6 billion. The largest adjustment was the mark-to-market adjustment of our pension and OPEB liabilities, which was a pretax gain of roughly $1.8 billion. This adjustment which was primarily non-cash was caused by an increase in the discount rate as well as other planned factors. We also incurred pretax expenses of nearly $200 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plan. The net impact of these items after tax approximated $1 billion or $0.24 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.80 a year ago, a decline of 3.4%. For the full year adjusted earnings per share were $3.87 compared with $3.99 in 2015, a decrease of 3%. Recall that our 2015 adjusted EPS included $0.13 of depreciation benefit related to the three wireline properties that we sold to Frontier. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working with our investors and all of you who follow our stock and sharing progress in our strategy to deliver the promise of a digital world. We are in a vibrant and exciting industry. Our leadership position in wireless and fiber networks, as well as our loyal and high-quality customer base, is a reflection of our commitment to continuous improvement by our outstanding employees, which places us in a great position for long-term profitable growth. The continuous changes from technology advances and the competitive environment will provide us new opportunities to evolve and develop innovative solutions to continue to be the key player in this dynamic market. I\u2019m energized by those challenges and the great team we have and I am excited about the coming years. My primary objective is to build on the strong foundation of this business and ensure we are always being responsible stewards of the company by running the businesses we have today as efficiently and effectively as possible, while investing responsibly to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Let us now move into an overview of 2016. As expected, 2016 was a transformative year for Verizon. We demonstrated strong financial performance and returned value to our shareholders, while repositioning the business. Our core businesses are executing well in highly competitive markets, and we are on track with our strategic priorities. During 2016, we completed wireline divestitures of three markets, negotiated new contracts with our labor unions, executed successful 5G technical trials, and gained traction in new growth businesses. Operationally in wireless with our network leadership strategy, we added 1.3 million smartphone net adds and maintained industry leading retail phone churn performance of less than 0.9% for the year and for seven consecutive quarters. In wireline, we restructured the segment and its cost structure. Overall, we delivered solid operational and financial results, which I will go into in more detail in a few minutes. Our capital allocation was consistent with our strategy. We invested in adding capacity through densification of the 4G network, acquired Telematics, and Smart City businesses and extended ecosystems to monetize data traffic. We reduced our unsecured debt and delivered strong value to our shareholders through the 10th consecutive increase in annualized dividends last September. Entering 2017, we are confident with our strategy and priorities to serve customers and increase value. The foundation of our strategy is a network that is ubiquitous and reliable. We will continue to invest in our networks, expand network capabilities and advance ecosystems to offer value to our customers. The execution of these priorities will allow us to lead to the network layer and develop innovative solutions to meet customer demands in the rapidly expanding mobile first digital world. Now let\u2019s get right into the operating performance starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $32.3 billion, a decline of 5.6%. Consolidated 2016 revenue was $126.0 billion, representing a decline of 4.3%. If we exclude revenues from the divested wireline properties and AOL, which became part of our operations during the second half of 2015, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 2.4%. Wireless revenue tracked with our expectations in the quarter as the shift from service revenue to equipment revenue across our base of customers is ongoing. Equipment revenue was seasonally strong, primarily led by new smartphone launches and equipment installment take rates. Wireline segment revenues continued recent trends declining 3.1% with consumer growth of 0.2% for the quarter. In our new businesses, we are pleased with AOL\u2019s performance for the quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, our digital media business, led by AOL, generated revenue of $532 million net of traffic acquisition costs. This revenue was down about 5% year-over-year as expected due to the revenue lift related to the Microsoft deal in the fourth quarter of 2015, but increased around 10% sequentially in line with our expectations. Organically, Internet of Things revenue was $243 million, up 21% in the fourth quarter. We expect to sustain these strong trends. Including acquisitions, Internet of Things revenue increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter. Strong cost management across the business enabled us to drive profitability, including offsetting the lost earnings contribution from the divested wireline market. On a consolidated full year basis, excluding non-operational items, EBITDA totaled $44.8 billion, and EBITDA margin was 35.5%. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. In 2016, cash flows from operations totaled $22.7 billion, which is impacted by payments of cash income taxes of $3.2 billion associated with the gain on the divested wireline properties. Full-year capital spending of $17.1 billion was just below our guidance of $17.2 to $17.7 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $5.7 billion, which does not include the proceeds from on balance sheet securitization transaction. In the second half of 2016, we shifted to on balance sheet securitization of our equipment receivables as it provides us a lower overall cost of funding. As we have previously noted, the proceeds from our on balance sheet securitization program are reflected in the cash flows from financing. During the fourth quarter, we generated cash proceeds of about $2.4 billion from on balance sheet securitization for a total of $5.0 billion during the second half of the year. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $108.1 billion of gross debt, which comprised of $103.1 billion of unsecured debt and $5 billion of on balance sheet securitization. Our year-end unsecured debt balance was lower by $6.6 billion than the prior year. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. In the wireless business, we are delivering a balanced operational performance in a highly competitive environment. Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.5% in the quarter to $23.4 billion. For the full year operating revenue totaled $89.2 billion, a decline of 2.7%. Service revenue of $16.3 billion declined 4.9% for the quarter as compared to the 5.2% decline in the third quarter. For the full year, service revenue declined 5.4%. Overall service revenue trends are consistent with the postpaid base migrations unsubsidized servicing pricing. Approximately 67% of our postpaid customers are now on unsubsidized pricing, which is ahead of our expectations due to higher volumes in the fourth quarter. Service revenue plus device payment plan billings increased 1.7% in the fourth quarter and 2.0% for the full year. This deceleration in trend is due to the strong migration of customers in the second half of the year to unsubsidized pricing as customers fulfilled their price service contract. We are also seeing strong migrations to our new pricing structure that we launched mid-year with safety mode and carryover data. While these plans have resulted in greater than expected optimization they improved customer satisfaction and retention. Recently we launched a single line pricing plan to improve our competitive position in that segment. Equipment revenue increased to $5.7 billion, up 6.2% for the fourth quarter and 3.5% for the full year. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans increased to approximately 77% in the fourth quarter compared with about 70% in the third quarter and about 67% in the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect the first quarter take rate for device payment plans to be similar to 4Q as two-year service contracts are no longer available for upgrades by the embedded base. At the end of the quarter approximately 46% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan. Improving the cost structure of our wireless segment is a priority. We see additional opportunities to increase efficiencies in our operating model through the continued application of our Verizon lean Six Sigma processes. On total revenues, our EBITDA wireless margin was 36.9% for the fourth quarter and 43.8% for the year. In terms of profitability, we generated $8.6 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, a decrease of 5.2%. For the full year, total EBITDA was $39.0 billion, an increase of 0.2%. As expected, the equipment promotional activity in the quarter was elevated given the holiday season. We will remain competitive in the marketplace. In the fourth quarter, overall traffic on LTE increased by approximately 49% while we extended our lead in the industry\u2019s third-party performance studies across the country. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.5 billion in the quarter and $11.2 billion for the full year. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter we added high quality retail postpaid net additions of 591,000 with a sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 552,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which are partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 456,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 167,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net additions totaled 196,000, which was 764,000 less than last year due to lower gross adds and higher churn resulting from previous year\u2019s promotions. Full year postpaid net additions of 2.3 million included 1.8 million 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets. The primary offset to these net additions was net declines in basic phones and 3G smartphones. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million for the fourth quarter and to 15.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in retail postpaid phone churn of less than 0.9%. Overall our retail postpaid churn increased year-over-year due to higher tablet churn to 1.1%. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.1 million in the quarter, down 1.9% and 43.2 million for the full year, down 7.3%. About 85% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. About 8.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, up sequentially and consistent with prior year. During the quarter, 8.6 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Net prepaid devices declined by 9000 in the quarter compared to a decline of 157,000 in the prior year. We are seeing sustained year-over-year improvement in retail prepaid. We ended the year with 114.2 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 2.1% to 108.8 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and mass-markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the wireline segment, consumer revenue increased 0.2% and mass markets, which include small business, declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, consumer revenues expanded by 0.4% and mass markets declined by 0.3%. Fios total revenue again increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter and increased 4.6% in 2016. Fios revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher Internet speeds. In Fios Internet, we added 68,000 net customers for the quarter and 235,000 for the year. We now have a total of about 5.7 million Fios Internet subscribers representing 40.4% penetration. In Fios video, we added 21,000 net customers in the quarter, and 59,000 for the year, and now have a total of 4.7 million Fios video subscribers, which represents a 34.3% penetration. Similar to prior quarters we continue to see strong demand for custom TV offerings. Our one-fiber initiative in Boston is progressing as expected and we launched consumer and business services to customers late in the fourth quarter. We continue to innovate with our Fios platform utilizing our fiber assets and earlier this month we introduced instant Internet, which is a new service that offers both upload and download speeds of 750 Mb per second. This service was introduced in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Richmond and other markets will see this service soon. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the wireline segment in total. Global enterprise revenue declined 4.5% and on a constant currency basis was down about 4% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 3.6% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3%. In our wholesale business as expected revenues declined 7.5% in the fourth quarter due to the impact of non-recurring items in the prior year. For the year, wholesale revenue declined 4.9%. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.3% for the full year. The impacts of the labor contract, workforce reduction and tight cost control supported improved profitability, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. We expect to see continuing improvement on an annual basis with seasonal fluctuations. Capital spending in wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $4.5 billion for the year. Regarding our pending wireline transactions, we expect the acquisition of XO Communications to close in the first quarter and the data center transaction to close in the second quarter. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 to discuss our strategic position. Entering 2017, we are confident in our strategy and priorities for future growth and profitability. The foundation of the three-tier strategy begins with our commitment to invest in our best in class networks. Above the network layer resides our platform layer, which we are developing and creating new business models to monetize the ever-increasing digital traffic growth. Our goal is to be the trusted provider of connecting people and things and providing scalable solutions and analytics. Network quality and leadership is the cornerstone of this strategy and at the forefront of our brand value proposition to our customers. Today we are in the largest and most reliable 4G network in the country with market leading fiber assets. To expand our network leadership, we are executing on our strategic efforts to densify the 4G network, increased fiber resources and enhance spectral efficiency. As I noted earlier, we have initiated our next generation fiber network deployments in Boston. Fiber is an important element of our wireless networks as it allows us to strengthen our 4G LTE capacity, which also preparing for 5G. Our pending XO Communications acquisition will add to our fiber footprint and provides us with additional metro rings in 45 out of the top 50 US markets. 5G wireless technology is a focus for us. We are now launching about 10 pre-commercial pilots across the country with multiple use cases including dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. Our goal is to test the 5G fixed wireless technology in different environments in order to successfully operationalize 5G for a commercial launch. As noted earlier, we are expanding platforms and building new business models to monetize digital mobile video traffic on our network. In our media assets, AOL\u2019s content and ADTECH capabilities have enhanced our video offerings. With a focus on delivering timely, short form versions of video clips we have seen digital video consumption gain traction in the last year. At the content and solutions layer of our three-tier strategy, the combination of AOL, go90 and other content has enabled cross-platform sharing. This strategy expands our distribution and revenue opportunity globally across carriers and networks. We have seen increased usage in the go90 application through this exchange and we are expanding our unique content offerings. The average daily usage in go90 was consistent sequentially at about 30 minutes per viewer, with less than 20% of traffic surfed on the Verizon wireless network in the second half of the year. We are actively leveraging our content portfolio and have strategically focused on an add-supported model. In 2016 through our joint venture with Hearst, we launched unique content through Complex Media and AwesomenessTV, and we are looking forward to expanding these offerings this year. In addition, our extensive digital rights portfolio including sports such as NFL and NBA provide enhanced viewing experiences such as launching [stream pass] for Verizon wireless customers across multiple demographics. Our pending Yahoo acquisition will further increase our opportunity to scale in the digital media space with its 1 billion plus monthly average unique viewers. We are still working with Yahoo to assess the impact of the breaches and we have not reached any final conclusions yet. The Internet of Things including Telematics, is an area of opportunity due to this rapidly growing as it connected world expanse. Ubiquitous and reliable coverage to support the vast number of devices expected on these various platforms is a comparative advantage and we are developing this ecosystem to leverage our best-in-class networks while providing solutions of verticals such as transportation, energy, agriculture and smart cities. A great example of this is in the Telematics space with acquisitions of both Telogis and Fleetmatics, we became the market share leader. Our Smart Cities Solutions continued to progress and the business is augmented with the acquisitions of Sensity and LQD WiFi. As a result, we now have a deep inventory solutions on our IoT platform to provide to our customers. Overall, we are confident in our ability to execute deliver results and return value to our shareholders while continuously transforming the business. As we look at our current and pending assets in the media in IoT businesses, we will be focused on integrating these assets by increasing global scale organically and further enhancing cross platform content sharing opportunities. Collectively, these assets allow us to participate in the global ecosystem of the connected world. We see a clear path to revenue contributions from these integrated assets which will drive returns to the overall business in a less capital intended manner. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 13 to review 2017 priorities. In 2017, our focus will be leveraging our network leadership positions. We will focus on retaining and growing our high quality customer base in both wireless and wire line while balancing profitability in this dynamic environment. Enhancing ecosystems in media and the Internet of Things let by Telematics will further drive the monetization of our network and solutions both domestically and globally. We expect full year consolidated revenue on an organic basis to be fairly consistent without a 2016. With improvement in wireless service revenue and equipment revenue trends, we also expect full year consolidated adjusted EPS trends to be similar to consolidated revenue trends. Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2017. Consolidated capital spending between $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion. Minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $600 million and in terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate of financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 34% to 36% based on current legislation. We will execute in the long term strategy to position the business for the future. With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you, Matt. Tory will now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please, we have the first question. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, you may ask your question.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thanks very much. Good morning. Matt, maybe we could start with the last point on the guidance. Can you just give us a reconciliation up in new guidance versus the previous GDP type growth and the normal type EPS. What are the changes they are causing that? And on EPS, specifically, can you just help us reconcile what the base number that you\u2019ll be using for as sort of a flat kind of organic number would be for all the adjustments with frontier and the labor dispute, etcetera. Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Simon for the question. Good morning. So yes, let\u2019s start with the outlook we gave this morning. And I\u2019ll start with the revenue. So, as you saw for now, we said we expect to see a consistent with 2016 on an organic basis. And we continue to see the revenue trajectory of the business improve. So, as you saw in the release, we expect that to be fairly consistent on an organic basis. So, this is an improvement over 2016, when revenues decline 2.4% on a comparable basis. So, let\u2019s unpack that for a sec and see how we get to that improvement from the negative 2.4 up to something is more comparable. And obviously, the major driver is wireless, where total revenue is down 2.7% last year and service revenue was down 5.4%. So, if we look into the service revenue component there, that trajectory improve throughout the year. We started in the first quarter of \u201816 down 6.2%, we ended the year in the fourth quarter down 4.9% and the year as a whole average down 5.4 as I said. So, as we expect that trend to continue to get better, we should see a better number year-over-year in wireless service revenue. Equipment revenue should also be higher given the higher device payment take rate which we expect to be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter which was a 77%. And so, obviously improve pending wireless, it will be the biggest factor year-over-year. And as you look at the other parts of the business, we expect wireline revenue trends to be similar, the 2016. And then Media Cover, we expect that will continue to build off the progress made last year. And then within the IoT businesses obviously included Telematics acquire a 21% in the fourth quarter. And we expect that business to continue to grow at a very healthy pace. So, on a combined basis, we are confident in seeing a better revenue trajectory in 2017 in last year. When you talk about the how we gave the outlook on revenue versus what we\u2019ve been saying previously. I think the biggest light and you got to look at in there is wireless service revenue. So, we continue to make good progress transition the base to unsubsidized service pricing and as customers come out of their two year subsidy plans, we see them quickly migrate to the unsubsidized service pricing. And we ended the year with 67% of the post pay customers now on those unsubsidized pricing plans. And so, while we were happy to have seen the acceleration, it does provide a head wind to service revenue. And then additionally, within service revenue we saw a higher level of migrations and then past pricing changes. To the plans that we introduced in the middle of last year and that functionality of those new plans appealed to our base. And we saw customers take advantage of that and not to might say a plan. So, those two development especially have essentially pushed out our expectation of the timing of the service revenue to return to year-over-year growth from the end of 2017 into \u201818. And as then as you look at the earnings side of it, obviously the largest driver of EPS changes is what happens in the wireless service revenue. So, obviously the service revenue being $66 billion, more than 0.5% of our total revenue. It\u2019s largest driver and so that\u2019s we continue to work through that service revenue migration. It is offset by the strong cost management we had across the business. And that\u2019s been a hallmark of our performance over the past few years using the Verizon Lean Six Sigma program that you\u2019ve heard us talk about previously. And that will continue to produce significant benefits in 2017 and will also see a full-year benefit in \u201817 from the new labor contracts. So, when you factor in all of the above, we expect to produce strong earnings again in 2017 and we talked about the trend we expect on EPS. You\u2019ve obviously got the impact in 2016 of one year of the Frontier properties in the first quarter and obviously the work stoppage. But in total will be around the revenue lines. It will be around where we were in 2016 as the baseline of our view for \u201817.\nSimon Flannery: Okay. So, just to be clear on the EPS. It\u2019s we should take the EPS that you reported for 2016 as the base for \u201817?\nMatt Ellis: That\u2019s a reasonable starting point, yes.\nSimon Flannery: Okay, great. And just one last thing on the optimization. Has that sort of faded at this point or is that still continue at quite a pace. Was that kind of a three or four month effect, are you still seeing a lot of that going on?\nMatt Ellis: Let\u2019s say and that still continue but we saw at a certainly an aggressive pace. Initially, after we launch those plans, so that just means the base moved quicker to those plans that we\u2019d seen in other changes. So, we\u2019re excited we launch product features where of high level of interest to our customers.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thanks, Matt.\nMichael Stefanski: Simon, thank you. Tory, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks. Just a follow-up first on Simon\u2019s question. Can you give us explicitly what the revenue number you\u2019re looking at in \u201816 sort of a normal number as well as the earnings number?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, the normal number for 2016 would be the comparable against the down 2.4% when you adjust out for the acquisitions over the course of the couple of years.\nPhilip Cusick: So, all right. So, exactly the dollar number that we should be starting with as the baseline to build from.\nMichael Stefanski: Yes, I\u2019ll come back to you on that one. As to say, we refer of the down 2.4% year-over-year. It adjust out for the transactions in both 2016 and also the AOL introduction in 2015. So, when you adjust both of those numbers.\nPhilip Cusick: Right. And I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m sorry, go ahead Mike?\nMichael Stefanski: No, I just going to say we\u2019ll get to you that exact number because it is both taking out Frontier for the first quarter.\nPhilip Cusick: Exactly.\nMichael Stefanski: As well as we do make an adjustment because we didn\u2019t have a full-year of AOL. So, that\u2019s how we get to the negative 2.4%. But effectively what we\u2019re saying is that organically that plus not including any of the growth for new businesses, that would be the consistent number, but we\u2019ll get you that exact number.\nPhilip Cusick: Okay. And then just to make sure, when you talk about better trends and it sounds like you\u2019re looking for stability. That revenue number you\u2019re looking for dollars of stability year-over-year not stable down tick in percentages. Correct? Now down 2%.\nMatt Ellis: Correct. Consistent on a dollar basis year-over-year and we get that through seeing improvements in the trend on the service revenue trajectory, the equipment revenue trajectory. So, in total across wireless and then also the newer businesses whether it be Media Curve or across the Internet of Things businesses, we continue it to expect to see those the revenue from those businesses improve in 2017.\nPhilip Cusick: Okay, that makes sense. And then on earnings is it 386 that we\u2019re using as the baseline from 2016 to jump off into \u201817 or is that a different number?\nMatt Ellis: That\u2019s I\u2019d go off with 387 that we had on an adjusted basis, adjusting off for the mouth to market another items.\nPhilip Cusick: 387 got it okay. And then if I just add one more new one, you talked about the gap tax 34-36 how should we think about cash taxes in 2017 under the current legislation?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, we would expect cash taxes to converge to all the effective tax rate during 2017.\nPhilip Cusick: So higher cash tax rate in 2017 than 2016?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, the cash tax is just purely on income obviously, our cash taxes for 2016 did include $3.2 billion of taxes related to the frontier transaction, we would expect to have cash taxes in \u201817 related to the disposal of the data centers, when that occurs at a lower level, but on the organic tax on earnings we would expect that the cash taxes to be closer to the ETR during the course of \u201817.\nPhilip Cusick: Okay, and do you have any initial thought on what the different plans of tax changes could be, anything you can help us as we model out the different impacts from border adjustments and things like that?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, so as we look at tax, we certainly, we\u2019ll be certainly, look it\u2019s a little too soon to tell, we certainly are supportive to changes in the tax legislation, we believe that we need to get to a more competitive tax environment and we look forward to working with congress and the new administration as Trump put new tax rate forward. Certainly a reduction rate would be beneficial, 100% expansion of CapEx would be beneficial initially, but the plans being discussed also include items such as removal of the interest expense deduction, and then as you mentioned, we\u2019re trying to understand exactly how border adjustable as it may or may not work, so certainly believe that tax reform would be a benefit to us, whichever year first it applies to whether applies to \u201817 or whether it initially apply to \u201818. We definitely seeing it being a benefit to the cash taxes we pay, but given the uncertainty on the specifics of the plan, it\u2019s a little too soon to say exactly how much that could be.\nPhilip Cusick: Can you give us an idea of within your CapEx and OpEx what other dollar number or percent comes from overseas and then I will stop?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve disclosed that number previously, so we\u2019d have to go back and look that back, we\u2019re not going to be disclosing that at this time.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks very much.\nMichael Stefanski: Phil, there is a reconciliation of the number of revenue that we\u2019re using in our financials that we released this morning on our website, but the number is $121.8 billion. So 121.8 would be the base for the revenue as we discussed.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks Mike.\nMichael Stefanski: Tory, if you could, next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks. Another follow up on the guidance, Matt obviously there is a lot of moving parts, but with the revenue trends and EPS trends sort of mirroring each other seems to suggest a route to roughly sort of flourish margin, but you\u2019re leading the year with real strength in wire line profitability. So first of all if you can talk about what\u2019s driving that and next is that to continue that should we, that the margins on the wireless side, but on the \u201817, should be sort of flat to maybe even down and maybe talk a little bit about that trend specially given the help that you should see from the removal of subsidies in the year? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yes, thanks John for your question, so starting off with wire line, certainly wire line had a good result in the fourth quarter, I would tell you as you say it in our prepared remarks that we would expect wire line margins for 2017 in the year as a hold to be higher than they were in 2016 and you\u2019ll see some seasonal fluctuations in it, as we typically do, so I would tell you be reasonable to expect wire line margins with the year as a whole to be in the low 20\u2019s compared to the 19% that we saw for 2016. So we see a lot of improvements going through the business, there obviously we\u2019re going to have the full year benefit of the new labor contract through there and we continue to manage costs in that business very closely in-line with the revenue trajectories, we continue to see kind of similar revenue to direct these for the enterprise and wholesale businesses and are excited about the files business which was up last year 4.6% on the full year basis, for files revenues and we continue to have more open for sale properties there, the great opportunities as we head into \u201817. On overall margins, when you talk about the wireless margins, this always comes back to where the service revenue trajectory is going to be. And so we certainly see improvements in the service revenue year-over-year, but we do go into the year off that 4.9% jump off point from the fourth quarter and we expect to see that continue to improve as we head into \u201817, but as I said we now see the point that which we get back to year-over-year positive number pushing out into \u201818. And so, I would expect us to have continued to a very strong margins in the wireless business but is going to be half of that service revenue trajectory continuing to be slightly negative though in an improving direction.\nJohn Hodulik: Did you think on a net basis you can keep those wires margins flattish?\nMatt Ellis: We will continue to aim to produce strong margin in that business and certainly believe that we have the ability to maintain a premium pricing in the market and we will, that will certainly be our aim as we go through the year.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thank Mike.\nMichael Stefanski: All right, thanks John. Tori next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could, first Matt, lot of focus on the guidance taking maybe $2 billion to $3 billion of revenue out of that number. It feels like something has changed on the ground competitively that\u2019s making you have to really get more aggressive on the EIP side and then the promotional side. Do you feel like Verizon needs to go to market more aggressively with an unlimited product like each of your competitors have and as kind of leading with these days and if you could kind of talk about kind of your view we all knew Fran\u2019s view on the economics of that but I look to kind of hear what your perspective is on the necessity that you do that and your ability to do that if you chose to? And then the second thing just now with G price elevation to the chair I think we have greater clarity on the likelihood that we are going to be getting rid of the privacy rules specifically in the telecom also the opportunity to maybe more aggressively monetize broadband. Could you talk a little bit about some of the opportunities and actions that you might be taking right now to prefer kind of the next regulatory wave? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thank you, David. So I will start with your first question. So as we look at our market position it's based off the product offering and we have the best network performance out there which is a major criteria in the user experience. Despite the claims of others third parties studies continues to demonstrate the superiority of our network and as network leadership position, I will say allows us to maintain a premium price round service in the marketplace. So as I look at our service revenues plus installment billing so the total amount we are actually billing a customer each month I think increased 2% in 2016. So that demonstrates how often it continue to be competitive and resonate in the marketplace. We continue to constantly monitor the competitive market. We look for opportunities to compete more effectively. And as an example of that we have recently launched new single line pricing which we believe was an under-penetrated market for us. So our pricing is disciplined to provide a return for our premium service. This number of different offers out there, we saw some folks go to unlimited. We saw some bundling of content and so on in the marketplace. We continue to assess where we are in there and so I will say I think our result we had 167,000 net phone nets in the quarter so I believe our positioning continues to be competitive. We constantly look as well out there. There is unlimited is one of the things some of our competition has at this point in time. There is not something we feel the need to do but I will say we continually monitor the market and we will see where we are heading in the future. In terms of your second question, so look there is a lot of changes going on in DC right now. Obviously yesterday we saw the announcement that as you mentioned G pie and so that may have a number of impacts across the regulatory space but I think it's just too soon to tell exactly where we are going to be. We look forward to working with the regulators for the CFCC or others. The other thing I would mention though you think about that we make investments for many years given the nature of the business that we are in. and our investment are focused on just who happens to be in office today. We make an investments so that for 10 plus years and I think our records stands for itself irrespective whoever the administration is run by and the regulatory regime they were effective and that will be continued to be how we focus on our investment. So I will say we look forward to working with the new administration and the new leadership and the FCC and we expect to continue to be competitive in whatever we environment we are operating.\nMichael Stefanski: David, thank you. Tory, if we can move to next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you. Hi. Good morning guys. So I wanted to sort of step back to a bigger picture question if I could. Matt given the comments that you made in the press release about getting the balance sheet back to the pre-Vodafone deal levels, how much room does that leave you before 2018 and 2019 for strategic transaction. There has been a lot of speculation about the types of things that you might do in this new environment whether it's content, or wire-line or spectrum or none of the above. I wonder if you can just sort of give us some thoughts on how much flexibility you have and how you think about the various factors of opportunity for you?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Craig. So as you mentioned that we have been on this path to getting back to the pre-Vodafone credit metrics by 2018-19 and that's part of our overall camp allocation, we have been able to be consistent with investing in our networks on a continuous basis, making that improvement in the balance sheet and also returning value to shareholders and since the Vodafone transaction we had a number of activities that we have done whether that be AOL some of the other acquisitions in IOT such as Fleetmatics, we have also divested of business whether it would be the tower transaction as an example. And so we have been able to continually make strategic transactions while staying consistent to each part of that cap allocation policy. So that would be our intent to continue to do so. And as we head into 2017 we believe that we will out of the two, while continue to maintain that cap allocation policy that allows us to deliver on all three of those key areas.\nCraig Moffett: And Matt can you comment on how you think about the various options out there whether it's content or wire-line or spectrum or something else?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So obviously look I am not going to comment on any specific combinations that have been rumored over the years and certainly I am - we are not able to talk specifically about spectrum right now given that we are in the incentive auctions. So we will continue to look for to opportunities to expand and grow the business. Although we\u2019re not completely aligned that we will be disciplined in any investment activity. We evaluate all options whether that's build by our partner for our strategic positioning and the key criteria is creating long term value for the business and shareholders. So we will continue to look for the right things to do to position the business to be successful in the future and that's we do that on an everyday basis and we will continue to do so. And I think we have successfully done that over the past few years.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks Matt.\nMichael Stefanski: Our next question please Tory.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup, please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, thanks and good morning. Two if I could. First if you could talk about how the 5G business case is progressing from the financial perspective and Matt what are the key metrics that you are looking for from the key that's working on business case to facilitate a green light of commercial deployment? Is there certain cost metrics like per home path or certain other metrics that you are focused on and then just if you could follow up on a clarification? So I think you mentioned that in terms of thinking about flat organic revenue for 2017 you took the revenue for 2016\u2019s tracked divestiture of market to frontier and you subtracted AOL. Can you help us think through what the backs have been on for the 2017 with the number of pending and completed acquisitions that you announced and are still in progress? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Mike so let me start up with 5G, so look we had a good progress in 2016 as we discussed throughout the year. We had a number of technical trials and labs go trials which we completed and so we have now moved on to the next phase of that which is some of these commercial scale pilots that are getting on the way right now in about ten different locations around the country. So we are very excited about the opportunities of 5G brings. And we will see how those trials go and we look forward to sharing progress with you on those as we move forward throughout the year. You asked around key metrics and I think it's going to be the same as any major investment we could be looking at is the combination of what's the cost of rollout 5G, we get into questions about how the distance from the node, how many homes can you cover many particular node, what speeds can we get, what\u2019s the cost of putting that there etcetera. Etcetera. XO obviously brings something to that but having additional five to the basis we think about rolling out the infrastructure needed for the 5G and but it's the same as any investment Mike we are going to look at the revenue opportunity. We think we can get based off the results of the tests around the way right now. And compare that with the cost. And if it provides a great return for shareholders we will certainly move ahead with launching commercially and if it will be the same as any other investment. We will look at the same way. In terms of your second question on 2016 you are right. The base line is reducing the frontier divestiture and also AOL because Sony had partially part of the year in 2015. So then if you think about total revenue for 2017 it would include obviously the full year of AOL this year. We expect XO to kick in later this quarter. We expect the IOT business as you are going to have the full year of Fleetmatics in Telogis and the other IOT acquisitions and then assuming the Yahoo transaction closes we will have the revenue from there too. So when you think about building on the number that Mike mentioned the 121 billion you got all those things to layer on top of that to get to the expectation for the full year. Obviously it relates to pending transactions. It will be contingent on the timing of those as well. But hopefully that answers your questions on that.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nMichael Stefanski: Okay. Tory next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. If I look at your CapEx guidance for the full year, essentially seems you are guiding to flat to plus or minus a reasonable range. So maybe you can maybe unpack that a little bit and just thinking about your network strategy and your product strategy what areas are you accelerating capital investment inside the business and maybe where do you feel like you have done a good job building our your network where it needs to be? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Brett, so as you think about the CapEx as you say the number is reasonable consistent year after year and that's something you have seen for a number of years but as you say within that it changes overtime. And so within LTE our spending has continued to transition from coverage to indentifying the network and that continues to evolve as we leverage new technologies around radio and hardware and software and then reforming our spectrum within 4G and identifying with small cells. So you will continue to see that densification of the 4G network and that includes how we put fiber out there which obviously is needed for the 4G network but also it's something we think about for pre-positioning for 5G so you will continue to see that - you will continue to see us launch additional pods of LTE advances as we go through that. We had the initial launch that last year. We expect additional features to come through in the close of this year. And we will continue to expand our architecture. So within wireless you should expect to see the spending continue to move to make the network more efficient on a cost per gig basis going forward. And as we have mentioned fiber is a consistent part of our business. So that's something you should expect to see us continuing. We have talked about what we are doing in Boston. You should continue to see us do that. Some of the other businesses aren't as we said previously they are not as capital intensive as our network business. So you should expect to see the CapEx will continue to be focused on the network side of the business as we go into 2017.\nBrett Feldman: And just a quick question as a follow up around where you are investing you talked about the pre-commercial 5G commercial trials you\u2019re running. Are these predominately within your wire-line footprint or do you actually think that when you are ready to go commercial you have a business case to go in whatever market so quick they have the best demographics regardless of whether you are an incumbent wire-line provider or not.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. It's not just in the wire-line footprint it's across the country and we certainly see the opportunity to deploy 5G solutions across the country as well once we get comfortable that they are ready to be launched out on a commercial basis.\nBrett Feldman: So you could do one fiber as in market across the country not just in Boston?\nMatt Ellis: Yes that's certainly we are looking at how we would support the 5G network across the country both in and outside the ILX footprint.\nBrett Feldman: All right. Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Tory next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies, please go ahead with your question.\nMichael McCormack: Hey guys, thanks. Matt, maybe just a clarification on your comments regarding service revenue turning positive. Just give us a sense obviously optimization continues but is that predicated stable pricing environment in your view. Secondly, on the retention side it looks like you have got about 21% Delta between those that are on sub-side plans versus those making device payments. Is that fair and as I think about that how much of that is bring your own devices versus off-contract versus your own retention efforts? And then if you don't mind a final one based on our math it looks like you still have about 13.1ish million feature phones out there so non-smart phones what\u2019s the strategy to try to move those over to smart phones or try to retain them to prevent headwinds on handset as we look in the 2017?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Mike, I will start with the last one, look we certainly like it when customers migrate from feature phones to an LTE smart phone but we are also very happy for those customers that just want a feature phone. They are not looking for the additional functionality but they want to be connected to a great network. We are very happy to continue to have those as customers and we look forward to continue to have offerings that meet their needs as well. In terms of service revenue and I think you talked about the gap between the 46% of our customers who have a device payment plan in the 67% of our base who are now on subsidize pricing. That's a factor of those customers come out they are two year service contracts and they move over to that pricing without necessarily upgrading a handset and we expect that will continue. That delta between those two numbers will be those customers who have either come out of two year subsidy and moved over to the un-subsidized pricing. They could be we now have customers who took out a device payment plan over two years ago who have completed those payments and are now no longer making a device payment every month and as you say BYOD continues to be part of that base too. So you should expect they will continue to be delta between those two numbers because not everyone on unsubsidized pricing is going to have a current device plan. So we see that continuing as we go into the year and part of that is certainly migrating over to device payment.\nMichael McCormack: Just a clarification, I guess I am trying to get to how much of that I am sorry to interrupt but the actual percentage that is it you going into actively retain customers that are still on contract to reduce their price point without losing a customer. Is there some component to that as well?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, the vast majority of our two year customers who have gone on to the unsubsidized prices but they've come to the end of that. I mean, we typically its customer has to get through their two year price plan if they're on that two year service contract before they were then being able to come to the unsubsidized pricing. When you look at our churn, I think what you're trying to get to is that phone shown it was below 0.9%. And that is not because we're bringing customers on to that pricing before they've moved their thing. Their continued strong churn represents the value out basis and the service they get and the high quality of the network what they have when they're authorizing customer. So, it's only when they come out of their two year contract do they move over to -- have the opportunity to move over to unsubsidized pricing.\nMichael McCormack: Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And just on the service revenue expectations, is that stable pricing is the expectation there or expecting this sort of promotions if we look at 2017?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. We expect to continue to compete in the marketplace as throughout 2016, we had various promotions throughout the year. I'd expect us to continue to different times of the year, have different promotions out there. But I expect base of that, we will compete effectively in the marketplace.\nMichael McCormack: Great. Thank you, Matt.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, Mike. Tory, we have time for one more question. So, last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thanks very much and good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Brett's questions on fiber. Specifically, how should we think about your future fiber needs? It seems like in some contacts you're willing to shed certain assets but have also acquired others and are also working with third party providers. In some cases over building in areas such as Boston. I'm trying to understand is that based in your actions, I'd seen as not all fiber assets are created equal. And so, how do you get to the point we have the right fixed assets in the right locations to support your network vision. And a just kind of brief follow-up.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So, good morning Amir. Thank you, for that. Yes, fiber is going to be a critical asset for us. It's a critical asset today and it will certainly continue to be selling as we go into the future. So, one thing it allows us to do and is certainly is within our footprint is it replaces the core copper networks that have served us well over the year. But from a capability standpoint, or now it's just a maintenance standpoint, it certainly makes a lot of sense for us to continue to replace copper with fiber. And then as you say fiber is going to be critical for us as we densify 40 and think about 5G, that it explains why the XO transaction was interesting to us getting those metro rings in 45 of the top 50 markets. The other thing you seen us doing in Boston was really look at this one fiber approach which was built in a network in a way that it provides a common fiber infrastructure to serve a number of different needs, whether that be consumers in home or in out of home and then obviously our small medium and enterprise customers too. So, you should continue to see us deploy fiber. How we deploy that fiber? Can differ from location to location. We certainly look where it makes sense for us to own the fiber, but if there's way for us to partner with other people, they can build the fiber on our half, we certainly do that as well. So, it a location-by-location, case-by-case basis, we look at the economics and we decide the best way to get to the fiber assets. And we need, and we think about that if not justify brands, so we need for what we were doing today, but as we think about the network going out in to the future. So, you should continue to see us make investments in fiber as we go forward and position the network to service the business well into the future.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Great. And just a quick follow-up on your 2017 outlook. What type of factors do you take into account on any potential changes for the comparative landscape? In particular, Comcast has highlighted that they expect to launch their WiFi and VNO strategy in the back half of the year, giving you focus who're partnered there, was wondering what you're factoring in with respect to that partnership in terms of size and impact of both your financials and potentially the competitive landscape.\nMatt Ellis: Yes, so as I think about, look we know they said they're going to they expect to launch that later in the year. We'll have to wait to see what is. As we said previously, look, we've been in the wholesale business for many years. We're happy to be in that business and we'd sign that agreement again if the opportunity came up. But look we don\u2019t expect that to necessarily have a major impact during the course of 2017. They got a lot of work to do there and I'll let them talk about this strategy on that. But as I thi8nk about the competitive environment as a whole, I would expect to continue to evolve in ways that some of which we may guess, others which we'll have to wait and see how they play out, but what I would remind you is that we've seen many different competitive environments over the past 15 20 years in wireless and I think the one constant is being is the way that we've always competed effectively, whatever the environments and I highly expect us to do the same thing in 2017.\nMichael Stefanski: Great. Thank you for your questions. Tory, before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close this session with a few key points. In 2016, we delivered solid results in the competitive environment. We had a quality customers will lead in the industry and network performance and customer retention. We had solid financial results generating cash flow and shareholder return. We are confident in our strategy and priorities led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize daily usage, maintaining a discipline capital allocation model and returning value to our shareholders. We are positioning the company for longtime growth. A key foundational element for our vision of the future is be the trusted network provider. Our strong network assets will enable us to be a centerpiece of this new connected world of people and things and give us the opportunity to participate globally and at advancing digital ecosystems. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us to create value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for your - time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Thanks, Jay. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo and Matt Ellis, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Finance Operations and Chief Financial Officer designee. Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran reviews the third quarter results, I'd like to highlight a few items from our quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pre-tax loss of $797 million. The pretax pension re-measurement adjustment due to settlement accounting resulted in a $555 charge and severance costs related to existing separation plans amounted to $242 million. The net impact after tax approximated $500 million or $0.12 per share. In third quarter 2015 earnings includes $0.05 per share of a noncash charge due to pension re-measurement. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter a decline of 2.9% compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Additionally, in the quarter we executed on our first on balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions totaling $2.6 billion. The cash flow statement reflects asset-backed securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. This captioning impacts the free cash flow metric, but overall net cash available remains unchanged relative to off-balance-sheet securitization. We plan to continue to securitize equipment receivables with on balance sheet financings in future periods. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2016 continues to be a transformational year for us just as we had outlined over a year ago. During this transformation we are executing on a very challenging competitive environment, investing and positioning for the future growth and returning value to our shareholders. Competitive activity in the wireless market increased during the third quarter as expected and we responded in a measured way to grow and retain our valuable customer base by introducing new wireless plans and discipline promotions. We have been successful in retaining our high value postpaid smartphone base and improving service revenue trends. In the wireline market we returned to a strong quarter of execution following the strike that impacted the second quarter. We grew our Fios base and improved the consumer revenue trend. We are focused on continuously improving our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. This execution enabled us to deliver overall strong margins and adjusted earnings per share. We remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation that consists of investing for growth, returning value to shareholders and preserving our strong balance sheet. Our investments are consistent with our three-tier strategy starting with investing in our network by expanding our wireless capacity and prepositioning for future growth in both 4G and 5G. We continue to lead in all third-party measures for network performance and reliability. We are investing in new growth businesses in digital media technology to extend our ability to monetize the usage on our networks and create new revenue streams from advertising, content rights, telematics and other IOT solutions. In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.2% dividend increase which raises our annualized dividend to $2.31 per share. This was the 10th consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase endorsing their confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and returning value to our shareholders. Let's move to third quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Our third quarter results highlight our ability to execute in a challenging environment and drive strong operating and financial results. On a reported basis, total operating revenue decreased 6.7% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of the three wireline markets to Frontier which closed on April 1, 2016 and the wireless commercial pricing model change. Excluding the impact of wireline divestiture, consolidated revenue was down 2.9%. In terms of wireless revenue, the service revenue trend was on track with our expectations for the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans and optimization of our current customers to the new pricing plans. Equipment revenue, which started the quarter slowly due to low volumes ended strong with the introduction of the iPhone 7. Wireline revenue trends were consistent with previous quarters. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.3 billion up 1% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5% up 140 basis points in the quarter. We remain focused on enhancing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business which we expect will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future. Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash flows from operations were $4.8 billion in the third quarter. Keep in mind as we shift to the asset-backed securitization model, there is $2.6 billion of cash that is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement, while in prior periods under the off-balance-sheet securitization model this funding would have flowed from cash flow from operations. Free cash flow for the nine months of the year totaled $6.2 billion which was impacted by our on balance sheet securitization transactions. Cash taxes for the quarter were higher compared to a year ago primarily due to transaction tax payments of $2.4 billion. This amount represented the majority of total taxes due for the gain on the sale of our wireline operations to Frontier earlier this year. The remainder is expected to be paid next quarter. The increase was also affected by certain benefits that we realized in prior periods which did not occur in this period. Capital expenditures were $4.1 billion in the quarter driven by increased spending in wireless for densification and in wireline for Fios installations as volumes expanded post work stoppage. We now expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $106.6 billion of total debt which includes $2.6 billion of asset-backed securitization debt, net debt of $100.2 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times. The net debt includes the asset-backed securitization debt. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. Now let's move into reviews of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.2% for the quarter compared to a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.3 billion in the third quarter. Service revenue trends are consistent with our expectations as the postpaid base migrates to the unsubsidized price plans. We now have approximately 60% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We continue to expect that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017. Equipment revenue was $4.1 billion down 3.9% due to lower equipment volumes. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 70% in the third quarter compared with about 67% in the second quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth quarter to be around 70% given the higher seasonal consumer mix of volumes. During the quarter 6.1 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total we have about 35.8 million phone connections activated on the device payment plan representing 41% of our postpaid phone base. Total wireless operating revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter to $22.1 billion. The cost structure in wireless continues to improve driven by streamlining of business process improvements in distribution, care and supply chain resulting in higher digital customer contact and lower transaction costs. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, flat with last year and we had a segment EBITDA margin of 44.9% up 170 basis points from 43.2%. Now let's take a closer look at wireless additions on Slide 9. Total postpaid net adds, which we do not include any wholesale connections including Internet of Things totaled 442,000. Within the postpaid net additions we added 357,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter which were partially offset by a net decline of 3G smartphones resulting in 242,000 net new high-quality smartphones. Overall net phone additions were a negative 36,000 due to the offset of basic phones and softer phone gross additions. Tablet net additions totaled 221,000. All other postpaid net additions totaled 257,000 with Verizon Wireless retail Hum devices being the primary driver. Postpaid gross additions were 3.8 million down from 4.2 million and up slightly from last quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.04% up 11 basis points driven by tablet churn. As we have previously discussed, we expect this higher rate of tablet churn to continue into the first half of next year as two-year agreements associated with prior tablet promotional offers roll off. We continue to see strong retention in our retail postpaid phone base. Postpaid phone churn was up 2 basis points from a year ago and remain below 0.90% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Net prepaid additions increased to 83,000 for the quarter which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new price plans for our prepaid market. We ended the quarter with 113.7 million total retail connections excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 3% to 108.2 million and our prepay connections totaled 5.5 million. Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 10. Total postpaid device activations were 10.7 million in the quarter up 12.2% sequentially and down nearly 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones with tablets accounting for the majority of other device activations. About 6.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year and up from 5.4% in the prior quarter. Our upgrades and momentum in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the recall of the Note 7. Additionally, we experienced an iPhone 7 backlog primarily for upgrades. Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass-markets revenue performance on Slide 11. Consumer revenue increased 0.2% at mass market's which include small business declined 0.5%. Fios total revenue grew 4.4% with consumer Fios revenue rising 4.2%. The growth in Fios was driven by a higher customer base, strong retention programs and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 16% of our Fios Internet based has opted for speeds of 100 Mb or greater. We continue to see strong demand consistent with prior quarters for custom TV. During the third quarter we returned to normal seasonal volumes ahead of our expectations coming out of the work stoppage. Fios Internet subscriber growth was strong in the third quarter. In broadband we added 90,000 net Fios customers for the quarter which were at pre-work stoppage levels. Overall net broadband subscribers increased by 24,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet penetration was 40.4% in the quarter compared to 40.1% representing an increase of 30 basis points. In Fios video we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter which was also consistent with pre-work stoppage levels. Fios video penetration was 34.5% in the quarter compared to 35.4% representing a decline of 90 basis points driven by increased open-for-sale markets and softer linear TV demand. We continue to see an opportunity to further penetrate the Fios markets we serve. Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.3% in the third quarter consistent with recent trends. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.4% and on a constant currency basis the decline was about 2.9%. In our wholesale business, revenues decreased 3.9% in the third quarter. Trends in our global enterprise and wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods. However, we expect that in the fourth quarter we will see a decline in wholesale in the range of 7% to 9% due to nonrecurring items in the prior year. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the period last year up 230 basis points due to Fios growth and cost management. We believe we will continue to make progress in expanding the Wireline EBITDA margin. As we expected, Wireline capital spending levels increased in the third quarter as we returned to normal operations after the work stoppage in the second quarter. Let's move next to Slide 13 and cover strategic positioning and investments. Network leadership is our primary objective in the markets we serve. We are investing in our networks and building capacity for the future and positioning our business for new industry growth opportunities. Recently, we launched LTE Advanced in over 460 markets delivering improved service to more than 90% of the U.S. population. We are steadily advancing our cloud and software defined network architecture and moving forward aggressively with our densification efforts and prepositioning for 5G technology. Our one fiber strategy initiative is on track and we are building our next-generation fiber network in the city of Boston. In July the FCC approved our millimeter wave spectrum band lease agreement with XO Communications clearing the way for testing 5G technology in different environments. Our 5G technical trials have been successful and we are now planning a commercial pilot program in 2017 where we will test the technology in different environments with several infrastructure providers to determine ability to scale and operationalized fixed wireless product offerings. Based on the outcome of our commercial pilot program, Verizon intends to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband solution in the United States. In the third quarter network usage increased 45%. Digital video is the primary driver of traffic on our network. In order to participate in the digital media value chain, we have assembled assets to grow in the digital media business. We have accumulated a large portfolio of digital rights and invested in specific assets to distribute, publish and create digital content. In order to drive incremental value from digital media traffic we are scaling and leveraging AOL's ADTECH capabilities to monetize digital impressions on and off our network. We believe we are strategically well-positioned with the right set of assets to grow in this expanding market. In the third quarter AOL's net revenue measured as gross revenue less traffic acquisition costs amounted to $486 million which represented an increase of approximately 10%. Net revenue growth was primarily driven by advertising revenue from programmatic platforms. Over the next two quarters we expect AOL net revenue to follow seasonal trends, but year-over-year growth to be lower due to one-time benefits in the prior year from the Microsoft deal especially in the fourth quarter. We are seeing strong demand from advertisers for AOL's expanding programmatic capabilities and high quality data analytic tools. We expect that the pending acquisition of Yahoo will further expand our scale in the digital media space. This would place us in a unique position to serve unmet customer needs, participate in digital publishing and video and to monetize the content. On the go90 platform, the level of viewer engagement as measured by daily usage has been rising steadily since re-platforming the application earlier this summer. In the third quarter, the average daily usage in go90 surpassed more than 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% of traffic served on the Verizon wireless network. While still early in its product cycle, we are very encouraged by the traction with users primarily attracted by unique content. For example in July we introduced an original streaming monthly reality series titled \"The Runner.\" Viewers can watch episodes aired three times daily via the go90 app, go90.com and AOL.com. The innovative game format with an emphasis on live user participation contributed to strong usage and engagement. During the quarter we expanded go90 participation in FreeBee Data 360, a sponsor data service which allows customers to screen live sports including NFL games and music without accounting against the Verizon data. We are seeing increased engagement in the application. In September with our partner Hearst, we announced the formation of Complex Networks which brings together complex and digital video networks RatedRed.com and seriously.tv. In the United States Complex reaches more than half of the male 18 to 24 population and it is one of the largest properties for this population. The content produced in this partnership will be available on go90 which we expect will further increase user engagement and traffic growth. The rapidly evolving Internet of Things market provides us with new business opportunities for our customers globally. We intend to scale Telematics, ThingSpace, Smart City and other IOT solutions globally. Organically IOT revenues were $217 million up 24% from the comparable period last year. Including two months of Telogis activity IOT revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter. IOT revenues were primarily driven by Telematics. Telogis which closed in July expands our Telematics capabilities targeted for the enterprise space. In July we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fleetmatics, a global software-as-a-service based telematics provider in the small and medium-sized business space for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. In September we completed the purchase of Sensity Systems, a leading provider of IOT solutions for Smart City. This transaction closed in October. The acquisition adds a leading comprehensive suite of Smart City solutions to our IOT platform. We are now focused on integrating the assets. Now let's turn to Slide 14 for an overall summary. As we stated coming into the year, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We continue to deliver consistent performance during this transitional period. We are executing in a competitive environment. For the third quarter, despite a challenging competitive environment in wireless we added over 42,000 postpaid net customers, retained high-value postpaid phone customers and improved our wireless service revenue trends. In Wireline, Fios performance was ahead of our expectations. In both wireless and wireline, we have made significant progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to invest in our networks and platforms to be the network leader in the markets we serve and we are setting up the business to return to growth in 2017. We are focused on developing new business models and revenue streams. In our new businesses we are scaling our media assets and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results and return value to shareholders while transforming the business. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full-year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015 excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full-year 2015, consolidated capital spending at the low end of the $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion range. We made a full year total pension contribution of approximately $750 million which consists of minimum funding of approximately $550 million and a discretionary contribution of about $200 million. We expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 36%. While we will be providing more guidance in January, we expect that organically consolidated revenue growth in 2017 will be at a level consistent with GDP growth for that year and adjusted EPS growth will be at normal levels. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get your questions.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Thank you, Fran. Jay, we are now ready to take questions for Fran and Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Well that was harsh on for Simon. So first, and thanks for all your help in the last five years and good look going forward and Matt, congratulations on the new seat. How should we think about postpaid phones and accounts going forward given what seems like a saturated industry and reinvigorated competition, are you more in a mode to harvest the existing customers than hunting for more share and accounts?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, thanks Phil I appreciate it. So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high quality base and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base both in phones, but as I've said before smartphones are going to be a slower growth for the entire industry as it gets more densified. But just a couple things that happened this quarter that did have an impact on our overall growth and really it was more from a gross add basis because as you saw we gave you for the first time our phone churn which is at a 0.90% for the last six consecutive quarters. So you can see that we are continuing to maintain that base and protect our base. But of course this quarter, some things happened that affected our inward bound or gross adds. One was, as we previously talked when the competitive world launches new price plans and this quarter was around unlimited and obviously we did not respond to that. But as I've said, there's going to be a two to three-week period of time where there is an impact to our growth and we saw that. But as I've always said, after that three weeks everything kind of normalizes back out. So once we got through with that we were off to a really good start with the Samsung Note 7 and then unfortunately there was a total recall of that phone which definitely impacted our growth because historically Verizon has always been the number one leader in high-end Samsung phones, so that certainly impacted us. And then of course we had the Apple launch and as normal everyone is in a backlog situation. So that's just a couple of things. The other thing we saw this quarter as well was we are totally focused on smartphones and you saw that our net smartphone growth was 242,000 and that's really where we're focused in on. As you saw also we made some moves in prepaid because where we're losing the subscribers is mostly in the basic phone category and we know that our postpaid pricing is more premium to the marketplace and less attractive to that segment. So we did launch some new prepaid pricing and what we did see was, we saw a double amount of our postpaid subscribers move over to our prepaid more than we've seen in history and that accounted for a little less than 50% of our prepaid net adds this quarter. So we did see some shift in our base, but the good news there is, is that we didn't lose the customer. We maintained the customer at least on the Verizon wireless network. So going forward as I've always said, we will continue to be very rational in our competitive response. We will respond when we need to. Obviously, we responded on the equipment side of the equation, but as we continue here unlimited is still not something that we're going to move to, but as you saw also we launched new pricing this quarter which we believe also addressed two of the major pain points for our customers. One was overage and we saw over 7 million of our customers moved to the new safe mode plans that we constructed which will protect them from getting overage charges in the future. And then second, we also allow them to now carryover if they buy an extra gig the month, if that gig is not totally used we allow them to carry that into the next quarter for usage for 30 days. So we have seen some really positive responses within our base, but obviously there was some impact on the gross adds and some of the competitive environment and we'll go into the fourth quarter very strong. And as I said, we will continue to strive to grow all aspects of our business.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Jay, we can take Simon now.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you, Mike. And Fran I going to add my best wishes to you and thanks for everything. Just following on, on the topline and the growth question, could you just help us bridge the path to the GDP type growth that you referenced again for 2017 versus the decline of 2.9% normalized for this quarter? some of it I guess is around the service revenue, but you've got to help us with the building blocks and the timing of delivering that. And then I think you were hoping to give us an update on the data center transaction, if you have any news there? Thank you.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Sure, thanks Simon. I'll take the data center and I'll pass the other question on topline over to Matt. On data centers we are proceeding with the sale of our data centers. We are currently in negotiations and we should have something to formally announce to everyone here early in the fourth quarter. So more to come on that, but we are progressing with the sale of our data centers. So Matt?\nSimon Flannery: So that's with one person, party is it?\nFrancis J. Shammo: At this point, yes we are in negotiations with one individual.\nSimon Flannery: Okay, thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Good morning, Simon. So your question about 2017 and where that GDP like topline growth will come from, so let's break it down by the different parts of the business predominately in Wallace as we've said we've been doing this transition. You've seen the year-over-year service revenue trajectory continue to improve. We had negative 6.2% in the first quarter. That came down to 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.2% this quarter. So as we go into 2017 we now have 60% of the base on the non-subsidized pricing. That will continue to expand and that will obviously be a contributor to the improvement in revenue next year. And as Fran mentioned earlier, we expect to get back to year-over-year growth by the end of the year in service revenue. We expect to see consistent trends within the wireline business, but remember we only have one quarter of Frontier in the 2016 comparison as we get into 2017. And then as you saw in our comments, we continue to make good progress in IOT and in the video advertising space and we continue to expect those pieces to continue to contribute to the revenue as we head into 2017. So when you add all those things up, we're confident at this point in time that we will be on track to deliver that GDP type topline growth and look forward to giving you more color commentary on that in our January call.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thanks for the color.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Hey, Jay, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question is from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nMichael T. Stefanski: David? Jay, let's move to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great and Fran again, it's been good working with you for the last five years and good luck in the future.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks John.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey with the cable companies announcing that they are going to move forward with the MBNOs mid next year, is there anything you can tell you or about how Verizon sees the economics of those agreements? And obviously given your unique knowledge of the terms what do you think that, what kind of impact do you expect it to have on the sort of overall competitive environment that we're seeing in wireless? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, thanks, John. So look, I mean I'm not going to get into the agreement. Obviously we're under nondisclosure with Comcast on that agreement and the other cable providers, but look, I mean we knew what we entered when we bought the licenses back just several years ago. This is a wholesale agreement and as Lowell and I have repeatedly said, we would do the agreement today again if we had to. I mean, it's a good agreement for Verizon Wireless. It is a good wholesale agreement. I can't speak to the economics of what they're going to do. You have to ask them that question, but look as I've said before, the wireless pie continues to grow. Everyone wants to get a piece of this pie. The industry itself will continue to grow around that pie, so it's not like I believe the industry. With the carriers will lose share to anyone. I just think there's going to be more opportunity for growth. If you look at the future and you think about the LTE densification projects that we have going on and then you look at the whole 5G world for fixed wireless. That's going to enter into a whole new growth trajectory for the entire industry. So look, again we'll compete against the competition, we'll compete against new entrants in the marketplace, we'll wait to see what's launched. And as I said before, we will respond where we need to respond and we'll wait to see what happens.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, thanks Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Hey, Jay, next question please?\nOperator: Yes, we have David Barden. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Can you hear me now?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, thank you, David.\nDavid Barden: All right, so I dabbled with my mobile phone the first time and again thanks Fran for everything over the past few years. I want to ask few questions if I could, just first on the kind of it sounds like the IOT and AOL ADTECH is that you are going to be part of the kind of revenue equation on a go forward basis. I was wondering if you could talk a little about the margin profile of those relatives to kind of the margin of the kind of general business as we look at it today. And then second, specifically on the wireline margin side, obviously we have the new union contract and we're expecting that to kind of have some follow-on benefits into kind of the second half and into next year. Could you talk a little bit about the cadence at which we might see the margin trajectory of the business kind of start to graduate upwards towards the legacy 23% if possible, thanks?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Sure, David, thanks for the questions. I'm going to answer the first one, I'm going to have Matt answer the wireline one. So on IOT, look, I mean we're \u2013 we see the Telematics piece of this to be a really high growth engine for us and as I said in the prepared remarks, we're looking at a 24% without Telogis growth rate year-over-year and mainly most of that is all driven via Telematics and Hum. So we will continue on that. As far as the margin profile goes, look I mean these companies are still maturing. They are profitable, but we expect that the margin profile will continue to grow as we leverage and on to these platforms. The other thing too to note that in the IOT world since it is a platform based technology whether you look at IOT or smart cities, these are all very what I would call minimally capital-intensive type businesses and that would go for video as well. So when you think about the return on invested capital, you get there much quicker than say on a network-based type platform. So we're expecting that the ROI on this will happen relatively quickly, but the margin will come and we'll talk more about that as we grow this business. Matt, on Wireline?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, so had a good quarter in Wireline as you saw the EBITDA margin improved to 21.02% so you're starting to see some of that improvement we've been talking about especially as we got out of the impacts from the work stoppage. So as we've said we expect that the new union contract would generate $500 million of cash savings through the term of the contract spread across 2017, 2018, and 2019, so you should certainly see that come through. We believe that you will continue to see the wireline margin expand. We had a good expansion in the past quarter and you should see us continue to make progress on that as we go forward into the fourth quarter and then into 2017.\nDavid Barden: Great, thanks, Guys.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Okay, Jay, next question?\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Please go ahead with your questions.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and in fact I just wanted to extend my best wishes since you first get upcoming retirement. If I could just follow-on two questions, first if you could talk a little bit about where you are in the testing of the 5G services and what you're learning in terms of the capabilities performance in the economic model and a potential third type into the Hum? And then secondly, just going back to the guidance on earnings where you mentioned that you want to get back to normal levels, but given the impact of installment plans and the purchase of the Verizon Wireless minority it's been a few years since I think you could call the changes normal. So how are you defining what normal earnings growth is for Verizon? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks, Michael. I'll take the first pool, I'm going to put the earnings one to Matt. So for the 5G obviously we've been mainly centered around lab testing of 5G we are now moving out into the commercial trial which we're going to span out across several different cities with several different types of testing, with different OEMs. So I wanted to give you an example, one city may be very density going into multidivisional job areas another one might be more urban with just looking at single-family homes. So, we're going to test this in very different types of commercial environments. The big issue that still has to be answered quite honestly is the scaling of the technology. So for each small cell how much can each small cell deliver to how many households and still deliver a consistent 1 Gb of speed or some speed that is comparable to a broadband connection to the home. So that still has to be answered and we expect to do gain more knowledge around that in 2017 with the number of commercial trials that we're going to launch. So at this point, that's really all there is just talk about I'm from a 5G perspective. Matt, I'll turn it over to you.\nMatt Ellis: Yes, good morning, Mike. In terms of the EPS growth for next year and where does she come out, she has stopped topline and we've already talked about how you get to that GDP type growth next year and the changes year-over-year that you should expect to see. And then you're layering in on top of that the continued cost improvements we talked in your layer and I'll talk about the continued cost improvements we talked about in Wallace. Obliviously it started last year with the restructuring of the business. We continue to make good efforts in reducing the cost to run the business whether that's reducing the number of calls we receive, we're reducing the transaction times and moving more of the transactions online, et cetera, ct cetera and you should see more of that continue. Wireline, we have the full year benefit of the new union contract coming through. You've seen some of the headcount changes that we talked about that we'll continue to help us expand the margin there. And then in the other parts of the business whether it will be the IOT or the videos we continue to add scale there. The margins there should improve. So when you add those things up you kind of get to an improvement in EPS that we think is in line with what the expectation out on the street should be.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Hey Jay, if we could take the next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, good morning everyone and Fran let me add my thanks and congratulations as well and to you too, Matt. I want to ask about the Yahoo transaction and first if you could just comment on press reports about the finding of a material adverse condition or a change and if you have any update to offer there? But then more broadly with respect to Yahoo and AOL, can you talk about how the proposed rulemaking at the SEC whereby their ISP would likely be held to an opt in standard for adjustability does that change your expectations of how you can monetize either the AOL or the Yahoo asset?\nFrancis J. Shammo: All right, thanks Craig. So on yahoo, look Lowell and Craig have both commented on this recently. So let me just reiterate what they have said. We are still evaluating what it means for this transaction. This was an extremely large breach that has received a lot of attention from a lot of different people. So we have to assume they will have a material impact on Yahoo. Lawyers had their first call yesterday with Yahoo to provide us information but as I understand that's going to be a long process. So unless Yahoo comes up with different process it's going to take some time to evaluate this. So until then we haven't reached any final conclusions around this issue. As far as the privacy goes, look I think there's a couple of things here. I mean obviously we take privacy and security of our customers extremely seriously. We live under the regulation of the SEC which has a very high standard for carriers around privacy and what we're looking for is that the FTC and the FCC come out with a common rule that makes it competitive across the entire ecosystem and that the rules are more consistent and so that everyone can compete equally and there's no winners and losers within the ecosystem. So we look forward to reviewing the final order of privacy from the FCC and hopefully the FTC and then we'll have to react to that. But look, I mean we're operating AOL today under the current environment and we will continue to operate and as you saw we'll continue to grow AOL under that purview of the privacy regulation. So I think we'll just have to wait to see where this all comes out, but we're hoping that it's an equal playing field across the board.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Jay, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking my question and once again Fran congrats and it's been great working with you. So my question is, if I look at your postpaid ARPA the quarter it was actually reasonably stable versus the prior quarter. So I was hoping you could maybe just give us a little more color on what drove that particularly the uptake rate and reaction to the new pricing you put in several weeks ago? And then just as an extension of that, if we extrapolate the trend we saw here suggests that maybe you would actually stabilize your service revenues a little sooner than you're talking about and I was wondering what you think the opportunity could be there to maybe get that stabilization a bit faster? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Matt, why don\u2019t you take this one?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, so I think what this one comes back to Brett is and Fran talked about it within the basic the continued growth of our 14 smartphone base we had net adds of 357,014 smartphones during the quarter. That has obviously contributing we saw a very strong adoption from our existing base to the new price plans. We saw a number of those customers step up in terms of the buckets they are purchasing and so I think you see that we have a very strong relationship with our base and our consumers continue to take full advantage of the network. We've seen video use or total usage on the wireless network up about 45% this year and you continue to see that show up in the after trend. So yes, as you think about heading into 2017 we expect to see especially as we've got 60% of the base now on the non-subsidize pricing, we expect to continue to see some strong ARPA trends as we go forward into next year.\nBrett Feldman: Great and actually just one quick followup, you had mentioned earlier that there were some device supply issues, for example the Note 7 and some of the iPhone 7 models recently. Have those cleared up and maybe just as a bigger picture, do you think that over the course of the holiday season you're likely to continue to suffer the supply issues and maybe that could contain some of the upgrades and activity levels we would normally expect?\nFrancis J. Shammo: Well, the Note 7 has been recalled totally and won't be re-launched. So obviously that's a permanent change to the lineup. We're bringing in new phones for the fourth quarter. As always Apple is always generally in a backlog situation for the industry. I don't expect that to change at least not in early in the fourth quarter. But other than that Matt, have you anything else to add?\nMatt Ellis: No that sounds pretty much it would expect Apple to get caught up as we go through the quarter here and we will see how that plays out.\nBrett Feldman: Great, thanks for taking the questions.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks Brett.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Okay, Jay, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael McCormack: Great, thanks and again best of luck Fran and it has been great working with you. On the feature phone base you have north of 13 million phones out there. How should we think about that? Is there going to be an acceleration loss situation or is there something you are doing there either with respect to you are mitigating churn or care or attention efforts if you can comment on that that will be great. And then just on the delta between those that are on unsubsidized plans versus those making Edge payments, that gap continues to widen out a bit. Is there retention efforts going on there or is there something else we should be thinking about? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, so I'll have Matt do the feature phone one. Let me just answer the unsubsidized and subsidized Edge phone. So as you know, we have allowed our base to upgrade and choose whether they take a subsidized or an unsubsidized plan. So that currently is the policy that we have and we'll have to review that policy as time goes here into the fourth quarter, first quarter of next year. So there may be some shifts within that going forward, but right now that policy still holds and that's why you see some of the separation between the number of people who have moved to the unsubsidized plan versus the number of people who are currently on a device payment plan. So we'll update that in the fourth quarter as we go. Matt, on feature?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, I think what you're seeing on feature phones is and Fran mentioned this in our earlier remarks that you're seeing some part of the move to prepaid has come from the feature phones. Look, we will have some people who have feature phones in postpaid stay as postpaid customers and we're very happy to glad that they will do that, but we also expect to see some of those continue to move into a prepaid environment which may be a better place for them to be. We also continue to see people moving from feature phones to smartphones and when we get that we see increased usage with those customers as well. So we will continue to monitor that, but we're happy with the trends, where they are going at the moment.\nMichael McCormack: Great, I look forward to working with you Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Jay, next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nTimothy Horan: Hi and good luck guys. Can we get a little more color on the CapEx its feel and the whole industry seems to be coming at the low end of expectations and I know you focused on this at the end and densification a little bit more. Is this kind of a trend that is sustainable? And related to this, how do you think your network is kind of holding up versus your peers? A lot of your peers are spending a lot less CapEx, but the RootMetrics and other services are saying that their quality is kind of catching up with your network, just any thoughts? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, thanks Tim. So look, on the CapEx trend, I mean I think this was all related to the strike that we experienced in the second quarter and we're not going to be able to catch up on that from an overall year-over-year perspective. So that's why we've revised the guidance to the lower end of our range. But we're still spending around $17.2 billion this year in CapEx. The other thing too is, you have to remember, we're spending our CapEx around wireless for LT densification and as we have talked many, many times before, we do our usage projections well in advance of where we believe that usage will come and obviously we know that video is the major driver of the usage. With a 45% increase year-over-year I think the satnav is over 90% of our data usage is on the LTE network. We see that continuing to increase. So we're really preparing for two years out from where our usage is today. So we are densifying the network and we've seen this movie before where CapEx trend goes down and user catches up and then all of a sudden the networks falter. So look, I think the RootMetrics report speak for themselves once again we want hands down across the country. That is the brand that we live by and we will continue to build and densify our networks to meet our customer's demands before they actually realize they need it.\nTimothy Horan: Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Okay, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thanks very much and once again Fran I wanted to echo prior comments wishing you the best of luck with your next endeavors and congrats now on the new role.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks Amir.\nAmir Rozwadowski: I was wondering if we could talk more broadly Fran about your M&A strategy, clearly you folks have made concerted efforts improving your asset portfolio to support both the media cover and IOT initiatives. As it stands today, do you see any areas where you may need to bolster your pool of assets in order to move forward with these strategies or as you exit this transition year should we consider 2017 more of an integration here for you folks.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Yes, I think that's right. I mean I think we've made some strategic moves here around diversification. We know that the Telematics business is a business that has high potential and if you looked across the industry there are a lot of competitors in there, but no one really has a big share within that marketplace and we want to gain more share within that marketplace and we think we can with the assets that we've accumulated between Telogis and Fleetmatics here. So we'll continue to move in that direction, but I don\u2019t think that there is anything large on the table at this point. We now have to integrate those assets and that's what our Telematics Group is actually doing right now. And as you saw, we launched Hum. Hum came out of the Telematics Group although it is for the majority sold through Verizon Wireless. It actually is a product to come out of the Telematics Group. So we will continue to innovate in that area. You're starting to see us do a little few things around smart cities because we believe that with the pre-positioning of 5G and the latency issues smart cities is going to be an area of growth for the future. I mean we have demonstrated with certain cities where we're deploying it now that we can actually save them money on a lot of different things and that their payback is relatively quick. So I think that is just something that we're positioning for the future. And then around media Co. obviously we have the Yahoo asset sitting out there, but to date we have accumulated assets that we believe are really strategic for us to grow this business. And as we've said before, we know that the wallet share of consumer for communications has been flat for relatively the last 15 to 20 years. So we have to think about a different way to monetize our network capability and that monetization will come through advertising. And it's real simple, I mean, the equation is, if you get more views, you get more advertisers, therefore you generate more revenue. And we see that now with AOL, even with the 10% increase in revenue year-over-year which is the first time we've given that to you, we're starting to see that advertisers are coming to our platforms. So now we just have to integrate and execute on that model and we believe we have the right assets to do that. So the long and short of the answer is, there is nothing large out there that we need to be successful with at this point in time.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you and a quick followup if I may on the mediocre strategy. You know it does seem like increasingly many are attempting to gain share from consumers via video not just some of your peers in the market but on a whole technology company level as well. How do you view your positioning and your ability to do differentiate going foreward? And I guess the question I have is, what have you learned about your strategy thus far be it with AOL Verizon digital media services go90 and how is that informing your strategy going forward in your ability to differentiate?\nFrancis J. Shammo: No, I think the big differentiation here Amir is, we're developing content for short foremen and really for life and that's really the differentiation is short form content whether that's over the top or via mobile. Also I think the differentiation for us is the integration across our platform. So if you go to AOL now you're going to start to see Complex come through. You will see RatedRed and seriously TV in the future come through on that platform. If you look at the NFL we've adopted that into the go90 platform and I know there's been some articles around viewership of NFL. We've actually seen a healthy increase year-over-year on our platform around the NFL. So, you know, we are headed in the right direction. The key learnings here have been, you need to have the right content that is appealing to the audience that you're going after and you've seen us make moves. You're going to see us move out of certain content that was originally in go90 that just isn't the right content. But sports news live original content is with the direction that we're taking on this platform and we think we will be successful with that.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thanks very much for taking my questions.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Sure, thanks Amir.\nMichael T. Stefanski: Thanks for all the questions. So for one last time I have the privilege to turn the call back to Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo: Thanks Mike. Before we end I want to highlight just a few key points. Number one, we are focused on maintaining leadership in network quality customer loyalty and financial performance. Strategically, we are aggressively building new businesses with revenue streams and ecosystems are expanding the entire industry. I am confident that Verizon will remain a leading player in the next growth phase of the industry and create value for our shareholders. Finally, I want to thank the Board, our investors and all of you on this call. It has been a pleasure working with all of you. It has been an honor and privilege to serve as the CFO of Verizon for the last six years. Thank you again for joining Verizon and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Servicss.

(Broker)\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tori. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam; and our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. Given yesterday's announcement of the Yahoo acquisition, we expect this call will exceed an hour. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Lowell and Fran go through our strategy and these results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $0.17 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results included several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pre-tax loss of $3.6 billion, generated by pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to the re-measurements triggered by the new labor contracts, the transaction with Frontier, and settlement accounting. The overall impact after tax amounted $2.2 billion or $0.54 per share. On the balance sheet side in the quarter, employees benefit obligations were reduced on a net basis by $1.6 billion, primarily driven by actuarial evaluations associated with the new labor contracts and the Frontier transaction, which were partially offset by the mark-to-market remeasurements and the assets transferred to Frontier. Year to date unfunded employee benefit obligations have been reduced by $1.9 billion. We incurred nonoperational expenses of $1.8 billion in connection with the early debt redemption and tender offers. On an after-tax basis these charges amounted to $1.1 billion or $0.27 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1 billion on the sale of California, Florida, and Texas Wireline markets to Frontier. On an after-tax basis the gain on sale amounted to $139 million or $0.03 per share. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 in the second quarter, compared with $1.04 per share a year ago, or a decline of 9.6%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of 2015. Our adjusted results include the impact of the work stoppage, which at the consolidated level amounted to $420 million on a pre-tax basis, representing about $0.07 per share. At the Wireline segment level, before consolidating intercompany transactions, the pre-tax amount was $489 million. As previously stated, we will not recapture the $0.07 for the impact of the work stoppage on full year 2016 earnings per share. For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the operations that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016, have been reclassified to Corporate and Other. On June 28 we filed a Form 8-K, providing the recast on audited historical information for the past nine quarters, which can be accessed on our website. Additionally, prior-period results do not include the operations of AOL. With that I'd now like to turn the call over to Lowell.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an eventful first half of 2016, marked with several strategic milestones. We continued to evolve our Wireless pricing model and customer interface. We closed the Frontier transaction. We made major moves in our network and reached new contracts with our labor unions, all while delivering solid results in a challenging environment. We will discuss all of these in more detail in a few minutes. In addition, yesterday we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yahoo's operating business for approximately $4.8 billion, a transaction that will make us an even stronger competitor in digital media. With everything that's going on I wanted to take a few minutes at the start of this call to put these initiatives in context and tell you how we are strengthening our ability to realize our mission of delivering the promise of the digital world. We have spoken to you before about our three-tier strategy. First, sustaining quality and performance leadership in all of our networks; second, in building new ecosystems around our broadband, video, and Internet of Things global platforms; and finally, monetizing our investments in networks and platform through applications and content. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making across all of these fronts. For us, delivering the promise of the digital world begins with network leadership, which has been the cornerstone of our brand since we formed Verizon in 2000. Our 4G LTE network consistently leads all external studies for quality and reliability across the country, even with the explosive growth of data usage. Over the last 16 years we have grown from approximately 25 million customers using Wireless almost exclusively for voice services to more than 110 million customers using Wireless for mostly data services. In the second quarter alone network usage increased 44% over the prior year. To give you a perspective on traffic growth, we carry the same amount of traffic on our network in 1 hour today as we did in \u2013 10 plus years ago in 1 week. In light of this growing demand we are continuing to invest in and evolve our Wireless network to provide the broadest, most reliable, and highest quality Wireless experience for our customers. This investment includes expanding the fiber front and backhaul to support Wireless network growth. Verizon has been a leader in pushing the industry forward in every new generation of Wireless technology. With 3G we ushered in the era of Wireless data. By being the first to implement 4G LTE we changed the game for the delivery of Wireless broadband, opening up new opportunities for our customers and the industry as a whole. LTE is a growth engine for applications and devices across the ecosystem, increasing the productivity of our country. New players are entering this ecosystem every day. To make sure 4G LTE can handle our customers' ever increasing demands, we are challenging conventional approaches to network architecture by deploying fiber to cell sites and densifying cells to handle the constant demand on the network in high usage areas. We are also optimizing 4G with new techniques, like centralized baseband architecture, carrier aggregation, and core network virtualization initiatives, which provide operating, capital, and spectral network efficiencies. The balance has shifted away from building capacity exclusively through spectrum. We believe that 4G will be the base layer of our Wireless network for years to come. Moreover, our approach to network architecture is also preparing us for 5G and shaping our thinking about future investment that will drive growth across all our business and ecosystem. You saw the first fruits of this strategy in April, when we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We will create a single fiber optic network platform capable of supporting Wireless and Wireline technologies and multiple products. In particular, we believe the fiber deployment will create economic growth for Boston. And we are talking to other cities about similar partnerships. No longer are discussions solely about local franchise rights, but how to make forward-looking cities more productive and effective. Our announced agreement to acquire XO Communications will also be a key part of this strategy, providing us with the deep fiber assets, including 40 metro fiber rings in major cities and millimeter wave spectrum in a significant part of the country that will give us a critical competitive edge. Yesterday the SEC approved our lease arrangement with XO, so that we have a clear spectrum path toward 5G deployment, which like 4G, will be a game changer. I think of 5G initially as, in effect, Wireless fiber, which is Wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With Wireless fiber the so called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. I know we heard a lot of skepticism when we formed the 5G Tech Forum last fall, with critics questioning the need for moving so soon. But as we learned from our experience with 4G, being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities. In our labs we're able to predict and model what a future home will look like, with multiple high definition TVs, laptops, tablets, and virtual reality applications served over a Wireless connection, delivered at speeds significantly higher than 1 gigabit per second. We are conducting field trials to see how the technology will perform using millimeter wave spectrum in terms of reach and propagation in real world conditions. Mobile use cases, which will follow toward the end of the decade, will include massive Internet of Things scale and low latency services and applications. Trade associations are already accelerating their timelines for standards, which will be good for the industry. The ecosystem, including chipset, equipment, and device manufacturers, is aggressively adding resources to deliver handsets and low latency applications. To date we have accomplished several key milestones in moving toward 5G. Along with our Tech Forum partners we completed radio specifications, which means that we can now test technical components for Wireless fiber services. We have ongoing technical trials in several markets to accelerate the pace of innovation. And we're strengthening our partnerships with carriers and OEMs to foster the development of a global ecosystem. So we see the stars aligning very quickly when it comes to the 5G future. We have been very pleased by the partnership with the FCC to finalize the 5G spectrum rules. All of this keeps us on track to be the first carrier to deploy a 5G network in the United States, preparing us for a fixed commercial Wireless fiber launch in 2017 and laying the foundation to build mobility use cases later in the decade. Through every generation of technology our fundamental principles remain the same: highest quality, consistent investment, customer value, and yes, superior execution. This dedication to network quality has created the best Wireless network in the world. Maintaining and extending that leadership remains the number one priority of the company. With the other two tiers of our three-part strategy, we're developing the platforms, content, and applications that will drive usage on our network and monetize our investment in this world-class infrastructure. Let me review our progress in these areas, starting with video. As you know, we've been building our video assets and capabilities for some time with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. At the heart of this video evolution are the changing ways in which younger consumers access their digital and mobile content. Over the past several years we have dramatically expanded the ways in which we can deliver content wherever and however the digital customer wants it, including: large and small bundles of linear content through Fios TV; new and better customer experiences for Fios using IP-based technology; over-the-top delivery of content; purchasing of AOL with its publishing and advertising technology and content; further enhancing AOL with the Millennial Media acquisition; introducing go90 and its vast library of digital content, not only for our Verizon customers, but other carriers' customers as well; developing a global video distribution platform for media companies to efficiently deliver high quality digital content; and finally, establishing a content joint venture with Hearst, through which we have invested in two leading digital brands for female and male millennials, namely AwesomenessTV and Complex Media. We assembled a great team and strong assets under Marni Walden. Just over the past year since the AOL acquisition we have learned a tremendous amount about the video market and opportunities to grow in the future. Her team is focused on integrating these assets and driving profitable growth by attracting viewers through great content, which in turn attracts advertisers by increasing the return on their advertising dollar. That brings us to Yahoo. We see tremendous opportunity in the digital video marketplace, which has an estimated addressable market of $180 billion by 2020. Today, that marketplace is dominated by two brands. Content creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption. Verizon intends to be a significant player in this space. By acquiring Yahoo's operating business, we are scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media. Yahoo's operations provide a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications which attract over 1 billion monthly active consumer views. It also brings market-leading content, brands, and sports, finance, news, and e-mail into the portfolio. It expands our analytics and ad tech capabilities and enhances our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers. We are already seeing enthusiasm from partners in sports, news, and finance to leverage this scale in the future. Yahoo's operations complement AOL's business as well as our overall asset portfolio. The global scale, volume of customer analytics, and market reach of the combined assets will allow us to create long-term value in a less capital intensive manner. We look forward to working with the very talented team at Yahoo. In the months ahead we will be focused on completing the necessary regulatory process, planning for integration, and closing this cash transaction early next year. Going forward, this acquisition will put us in a great position as a top global media company and give us a significant source of revenue growth for the future. We are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging Internet of Things market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform layers. We had another quarter of 25% growth in revenue from the Internet of Things, which amounted to approximately $205 million in the quarter and about $400 million year to date in 2016. We've also seen strong demand for our telematics products, including our direct-to-consumer product, hum, and see many opportunities to expand in the market. In June we agreed to acquire Telogis, which will advance our fleet telematics connected solutions and expand our distribution relationships while we grow our global scale. So as we are making tremendous strides strategically, John Stratton and his operations team are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to operational performance. I am pleased with where we stand as we reach the midpoint of the year. In Wireless we've made significant progress in shifting away from the subsidy model, with 53% of our postpaid phone base now on unsubsidized price plans. At the same time, our churn metrics continue to be the best in the industry, which is a testimony to our high quality loyal customer base. Fran is going to cover more of that in a few minutes. In Wireline we completed the sale of three properties to Frontier, which concentrates our Wireline assets in the Northeast corridor where we can further invest in fiber. We also managed through a 7-week work stoppage, ultimately reaching an outcome that benefited our employees and our business. While the strike impacted the results in the second quarter, the new labor contracts will generate approximately $500 million of cash savings over the term of the contract. The contract benefits include workforce flexibility provisions that provide the opportunity to optimize processes and scale customer service centers to better align with the business needs. Also, noncash benefit savings primarily related to retiree healthcare will be realized. We preserved the bargained-for caps on our annual obligation for post-retirement medical benefits, which when netted with other postretirement benefit changes reduced our unfunded employee benefit obligation by $4.7 billion in the quarter. I'd like to thank our management employees for stepping in and serving our customers day in and day out during the strike. We are proud that our customer satisfaction results remained strong during this time, which demonstrates not only our planning but our commitment to placing customers first in our business. I'd also like to thank the vast majority of our associates for the respectful way in which they conducted themselves during the work stoppage. We look forward to continuing to work with our represented employees to better serve our customers and create work environments that will allow all of our employees to grow professionally. Overall, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost structure through workforce reductions and the new labor contract benefits that we just discussed. As always we're focused on driving efficiencies through our ongoing Lean Six Sigma program. So as I look at the first half of 2016, I'm pleased with what we have accomplished in a fast moving, challenging environment, and how far we have come repositioning ourselves strategically for the next decade. Now let me turn the call over to Fran to review second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, which was not part of our operations a year ago, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 3.5% on a comparable year-over-year basis. AOL once again delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter. In Wireless, service revenue as expected was pressured by the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans. Equipment revenue was also under pressure, due primarily to lower postpaid phone activations. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled about $11.1 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% in the quarter, compared to $11.8 billion a year ago. As Lowell just reviewed, we are reducing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business, which will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future. Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operations were $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, cash flows from operations totaled $12.8 billion, which is down $6.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, driven by the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, a change in our method of monetizing device payment receivables, and an increase in cash taxes. Most of our device payment plan receivables originated in the second quarter were retained in contemplation of an asset-backed securitization transaction in the third quarter. This timing resulted in approximately $1.6 billion of working capital pressure. Free cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $5.6 billion (sic) [$5.5 billion]. Subsequent to the quarter, we completed our first on balance sheet asset-backed securitization transaction with net proceeds of $1.1 billion, for which there was significant investor demand. Going forward, we expect to finance new device payment plan receivable originations with on balance sheet securitizations with a mix of bank transactions or public transactions. Public, or 144A, on balance sheet securitization as a funding channel provides several benefits, including diversification and lower borrowing costs with AAA ratings. Favorable captive finance treatment from two credit rating agencies is an offset to the financial statement impacts of on balance sheet financing. The financial statements will reflect an increase in receivables as new loans are originated. And debt will also reflect new securitization financings. Going forward, the cash flow statement will reflect securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. As a result, using on balance sheet financing will result in lower cash flows from operations, and therefore lower free cash flow, but will not reduce the cash we have available to run the business, as we plan to continue to securitize a significant amount of our receivables portfolio. We will provide additional disclosures on securitization in the third quarter. Cash taxes are higher compared to a year ago, as certain benefits that we realized in the prior period did not recur. And timing of tax deductions for early debt retirements varied. Cash taxes will increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to the taxes that will be paid related to the sale of our Wireline operations, which are approximately $3.2 billion. Our disciplined capital allocation model demonstrates our commitment to investing in businesses for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion for the first half of the year. While the first half trend is lower than expected due to timing and the strike impact in Wireline, we reiterate our full year capital guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. We ended the quarter with $99.7 billion of total debt, net debt of $96.9 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2 times, which includes the liability management that we did in the quarter. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. Now let's move into reviews of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 4% in the quarter to $21.7 billion. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.4% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-over-year decline of 6.2% in the first quarter. Equipment revenue was $3.7 billion, down 4.1% due to lower activations. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.1 billion in the second quarter. While service revenue will continue to be pressured by the migration of our customer base to the unsubsidized price plans, the decline has flattened as expected, now that we have approximately 53% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We recently refreshed the Verizon plans to enable increased customer control. We believe the pricing plans are resonating with our customers, providing value and functionality. As with any new pricing plan, we expect some account optimization early on. And we remain confident that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the fourth quarter of 2017. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 67% in the second quarter, compared about 68% in the first quarter. The take rate, which was lower than our expectations, was due primarily to a higher mix of business customers in our overall postpaid phone activations for the quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. We recognize that new device launches could have an impact on take rate levels, but at this point it is too early to forecast any changes. During the quarter 5.2 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total we have about 31.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing about 37% of our postpaid phone base. In terms of profitability we generated $10.3 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 3.8%. And had a segment EBITDA margin of 47.5%, up from 43.9% a year ago. Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 8. Postpaid net adds, which does not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 615,000. Overall, postpaid net additions declined sequentially, primarily due to increased tablet churn. Net phone additions increased sequentially to 86,000. We added 462,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were offset by a net decline of 250,000 basic phones. The remaining offset in phone net adds were 3G devices. Tablet net adds totaled 356,000. All other postpaid devices totaling 173,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver. Net prepaid devices declined by 30,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year, due to the impact of new pricing plans for our prepaid market. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, down from 3.9 million a year ago and flat sequentially. Retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, up 4 basis points from the prior year. We continue to see strong retention in our phone base, which is being offset by increasing tablet churn, stemming from the free tablet promotions from 2 years ago. We expect the higher rates of tablet churn to continue throughout the entire year. We ended the quarter with 113.2 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection base grew 3.9% to 107.8 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations were 9.5 million in the quarter, down 4.3% sequentially and nearly 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 81% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activation. About 5.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. This represents a decline of 180 basis points. Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. Consumer revenue declined 0.3% and mass markets, which includes small business, declined 1.2% on a comparable basis, excluding the properties sold to Frontier. Fios total revenue grew 3.7%. Fios revenue was strong, even with the work stoppage and a high prior-year comparable pay-per-view fight event. The growth in Fios is driven by a higher customer base and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 11% of our Fios Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater. We continue to see the downsizing of our video bundles and increased appetite for our custom TV package, which represented nearly 40% of Fios video sales in the quarter. Fios subscriber growth was impacted by the work stoppage in the second quarter. We made significant progress on working through the backlog of new installations in June and expect to return to a normal run rate in the third quarter. In Fios video net customers declined 41,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet net adds were negative 13,000. And net broadband subscribers decreased by 83,000. Fios Video penetration was 34.6% in the quarter, compared to 35.5% in the prior year, representing the decline of 90 basis points. Fios Internet penetration was 40.1% in the quarter, compared to 39.8% in the prior year, representing an increase of 30 basis points. We believe we have an opportunity to further penetrate the markets we serve. Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.4% in the second quarter, due to technology transitions and pricing pressures. In the second quarter global enterprise revenue declined 3.3%. And on a constant currency basis the decline was about the same. In our global wholesale business revenues declined 4.1% in the second quarter. Trends in our enterprise and global wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods. Wireline segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was 14%, which includes the impact of work stoppage, compared to 18.7% in the prior year. The pre-tax financial impact of the strike in the quarter was $489 million on the Wireline segment. In terms of improving the overall margin, we made improvements in cost structure by optimizing our workforce and expect benefits from the new labor contracts to be realized during the remainder of 2016 and in future years. Wireline capitalized labor expenditures slowed in the second quarter as we prioritized maintenance and repair activities over new installations during the work stoppage. We expect capital spending levels to increase in the second half of the year as we return to normal operations after the work stoppage. Let's move next to our summary slide. As expected, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We are focused on executing operationally, strategically and financially to deliver results today and prepare the business for future profitable growth. In the first half of the year in Wireless we added 1.3 million postpaid net customers and stabilized our Wireless service revenue declines. In Wireline we completed the sale of the operations in California, Florida, and Texas and negotiated new labor contracts which will have benefits into the future. We continue to be the network leader in the markets we serve. And we are setting the business up for growth. In our new businesses we enhanced our Video and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. We are very excited about the work that has already been done, the integration of assets that we are beginning to do, and the acquisition of Yahoo to accelerate our Video platforms. As we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and drive results. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage, consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015, consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion, a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million, and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. We also expect GDP-type growth in consolidated revenue for the full year 2017. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Fran. Tori, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks and good morning, guys. Maybe quick \u2013 couple quick questions for Lowell. Lowell, first of all, could you give us an early look at the synergies that you see coming with the Yahoo transaction? And with it behind you now, do you feel that you have the assets you need to execute on the new media strategy? Thanks.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, good morning, John, and good morning, everyone. I understand there were lots of rumors about me announcing a big reorganization of the company, so I'm sorry to disappoint you. But I think we have some pretty exciting things to talk about here. First, on Yahoo synergy. Look, certainly as we went into the auction process, we had a very good idea of what the synergies could be. I think probably we were the only significant bidder that had synergies. So we have a good idea, and we've heard numbers bantered around that are in the ballpark. But my view on this, John, is we now enter a phase where post the auction diligence, which is certainly limited, we can go in and talk to management and see a much greater depth of information. And we'll validate our plans and make our decisions. So I think as we get closer to closing, which we expect will be either at the end of the year or early in the first quarter, we'll announce those numbers. But they're meaningful, let me just put it that way. On the \u2013 do we have the assets we need? Certainly yesterday when Marni [Walden] and Tim [Armstrong] did their public interviews, we're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo has in the area of sports and finance and email and news. And you match those up with AOL, we've just made an exponential leap in capabilities here. But I'll give you the answer that I always give you, John, when we talk about capital. And you say, well, are you finally done expanding and are you going to reduce your capital? And my answer always is, I hope not. Because if we do, then we're standing still. And this is such a dynamic environment, we should be looking for additional things to meet customers' needs. And I fully expect that when Tim and Marissa [Mayer] put their heads together, we'll have a long list. And we'll be disciplined as we always are. And they'll be good investments that'll drive us to take a larger share of this growing market. So there's been a lot made of, oh, are we going to challenge Google and Facebook in this process? I just say, look, we plan on being a significant player here. The market is going to grow dramatically. We're a small player today relative to them. All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market and this will be a success for us. And we certainly expect to do better than that.\nJohn Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC: Great.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. Thanks, John. We appreciate the question. Next question, Tori?\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Fran, I think you were one of the early ones to talk about elongating handset cycles. I think what we've seen so far with three companies reporting is very low upgrade rates, relatively low switching, but also low adds, low churn. To what extent do you think this is a typical sort of pre-iPhone lull? Or do you think we're in a new environment of more subdued activity going forward? And in particular as you think about your growth, you talked about the ARPU stabilizing and service revenues returning. But you also need stronger volume growth. What can you do to stimulate more of the phone adds as we go forward here? Thanks. And anything you can say on the data center sale as well would be appreciated.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: All right, great. Thanks, Simon. So on handset cycles, so two viewpoints here. One is obviously we saw a similar trend \u2013 maybe not this dramatic \u2013 in 2014 where we saw a slowdown in the first half of the year in anticipation of iconic phones that were coming up on a 2-year cycle. So I think some of it could be that. Unfortunately for us though, we have our first set of EIP customers coming up on their 2-year anniversary. And there's not enough volume yet of those customers to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they're going to hold their phone and take a $20 to $25 discount on their bill or if they're just waiting for a new phone. So I think it's too early to tell. We'll have a better feel for this as we go into the second quarter (sic). And that's why in my prepared remarks, I said it's too early to reforecast. But as I've said consistently, I think our volumes will be similar to 2015. As far as the, how do we stimulate phone, smartphone growth? Look, I've been saying for over a year now that smartphone growth is going to continue to slow. And we have to look at other areas for that growth, obviously tablets being one. And we have a little bit of a headwind there. But if you look at the gross adds of tablet, we added over a million tablets this quarter. So we are having pressure in the churn metric for that free tablet promotion that we did 2 years ago. And we will continue to have that pressure throughout the rest of the year. But if you look at the momentum of hum and you look at the other adds that we did, these are the types of devices that we want to add to the account to increase our revenue overall. And if you look at the underlying ARPA, which is the installment and revenue per unit, that increased to 2.6% this quarter. So you can see the underlying revenue of our base is actually increasing. Unfortunately, you're not seeing it in the results, because the math of moving from the subsidized to the unsubsidized is declining that. The last comment I'll make here on this topic is service revenue. So you saw the 80 basis [point] improvement on service revenue. And as we've continued to say, once we crossed over that 50% mark, and now we're at 53% of the base on the unsubsidized pricing, we are starting to see that service revenue math take effect and that decline starting to reverse. So an 80 basis point this quarter. I continue to see that through the rest of the year we will improve. I will say that there won't be as much of an improvement in third quarter, because of the new pricing and some of the optimization. But we will see improvement. And I continue to see this trend going through the end of 2017, which I'm still confident that we will show accretion at the end of 2017. Finally, on the data center sales we are coming to an end of the process. And we will probably come to a definitive answer in the third quarter as to whether we're going to move forward or we're not. And so I'll hold comment for the third quarter for that.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the color.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Oh, thanks. If I could follow up on Yahoo for a moment. In a letter that was picked up by the press from Yahoo's CEO yesterday, it referred to Verizon's goal to get to a global audience of 2 billion users and $20 billion of revenue within the mobile media business by 2020. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that goal in a couple of respects? In terms of what are the key strategies to get that growth? Is it simply just leveraging the assets you have? Or can you give us a little more color on how you look to maybe manage them differently than they've been managed in the past? And then secondly, how should investors think about the profitability of that type of revenue in this category over time? Thanks.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. I'll \u2013 let me take the strategic question. And then Fran can talk a little bit more about the profit side. Mike, I think this is similar to my answer to John's question. We've got a perspective going into this, and we'll refine it as we go along. But if you take a look at the interest that we have received from AOL current partners as well as new partners, we think there's a huge opportunity in the following areas. First, in the sports area. As you know we've got relationships with a lot of the big leagues. Certainly NFL and NBA are the headliners for us. I've spoken with both Roger Goodell and Adam Silver in the last few weeks about this. And I think we're very excited. And I expect over the next few months you'll see more details about the plan of what we can do with their content, not only in season but out of season. And there are other sports leagues that we have the opportunity to work with. Some of other big names, I'm not going to tip our hand here just yet. But the networks and their sports channels see an opportunity to partner with us. They may already have NBA rights or NFL rights. And we can work on streaming their games, not only through the traditional channels of Fios, either Custom TV or the full bundles, but over AOL and Yahoo and then finally over go90. So we view this as a waterfall of content moving down through our different properties. The next one is Yahoo Finance. That's probably their strongest asset today. We'll learn more about that. But as you look at again some of the networks that have finance channels, and frankly some of the other folks that were bidding on this, we think there's an opportunity for us to work with them in partnership to realize some of their visions and some of our visions. And then certainly news, as you would expect, and the email platforms, we see ways that we can combine some of our assets and some of their assets, the TechCrunch, the Engadgets, the Huffington Post. And we can drive a lot of visits to the site. So I think the different for us is we have a lot of \u2013 us versus the Yahoo management \u2013 we have a lot of the relationships well-established, because of our Fios and our mobile assets. And we can combine them with their platforms and their leadership expertise to deliver a very good lineup here. So I think on the profitability side, Fran, I don't know. Any comments you have on that? But that's where we'll head from a strategic perspective, Mike.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Mike. What I would say is everything that Lowell said. And we're looking at this as a portfolio of assets. And as I said during this whole process, look, Yahoo brings viewers, viewers brings advertising, advertising brings top line growth. So the first thing here is to scale, to drive that top line growth. We believe that with the combination of all these assets, we have a lot of revenue synergy upside. So the first will be to drive the top line. And then as Tim has shown, and along with the Yahoo team, we'll drive the profitability that's required to generate the cash flow that we forecast. So that's the top priority right now.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Mike, thank you. Tori, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks so much, guys, for taking the questions. Maybe two if I could. First, Fran, you highlighted a GDP level of revenue growth next year. I think in the past you've talked about a kind of mid- to high-single digit normal earnings growth expectation for next year. Could you just kind of confirm that those two are the same thing? And then second, just I think in Lowell's commentary, he kind of referenced a view that spectrum is not necessarily the be-all, end-all for creating capacity at the margin. In the notes out this morning you noted that 93% of the data traffic is on LTE capacity. I was wondering if you could kind of refresh us as to where or how much of your spectrum portfolio is dedicated to LTE? And how much is still available to be tapped to kind of continue to support that 40% plus growth rate in consumption? Thanks.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, David. Thanks for your question. Let me go first on the spectrum side. And then Fran can cover the first part of your question about growth rates. Today, just to say it, about 50% of our spectrum is dedicated to 4G LTE. We still have some spectrum on 2G. We're refarming our CDMA spectrum as we go forward. And I expect that we've got plenty of headroom here. The point of my comments \u2013 and Boston is our good example there \u2013 is the farther we push fiber out into the network, the more small cell technology works for us. And the cost trade off that we expected prior to the last auction told us that we would be better off going with the small cells than we would paying the prices that were \u2013 that the spectrum was demanding. At the Super Bowl last year we went in and built out San Francisco and proved that thesis was correct. We were actually more conservative than we needed to be. The Boston effort that we've got underway now will further solidify that opinion. And then as we densify the network for 4G, it sets us up perfectly for deploying 5G with the millimeter wave technology. So we're extremely pleased that the FCC approved the XO lease arrangement yesterday, because now we have a clear field in front of us to not only densify with 4G, but use that same capital dollar to get the infrastructure in place for 5G. So we think we're in a very strong competitive position here.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, David, on the second part on the 2017 numbers. Yes, GDP revenue growth for 2017. And we've done a lot of work behind this obviously. What we've talked about around service revenue plays a big factor in this and the comps year over year. But we believe some of these other things start to \u2013 really start to generate some top-line revenue, like IoT, 25% year-over-year growth rate now. We see that accelerating. Tablets, we believe once we get through the churn headwind of the free promo, they will become a bigger contributing factor next year. So there's a lot of things that go into that. But we're pretty confident on that GDP growth. And then on the bottom line, all I've said \u2013 I've never again a percentage. But all I've said is a normal growth rate for Verizon. And what that means is exclude the last 2 prior years, where we bought Vodafone and got a 10% increment over our normal growth rate. And then of course the prior year, which was impacted by the EIP accounting. So that's all I've said. And we'll talk more about that when we get to the first quarter of next year.\nDavid William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, it's Phil. So first of all, can you help us understand the progress on the 5G trials? What are you learning about the cost of deployment? Usable distances and speeds? And then, Fran, you mentioned tablets are slower, but you do expect a rebound once churn falls away. Do these add value? Is it mostly just sort of tacking on and pulling those customers in more tightly? Or do they actually add value economically on their own? Thanks.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. I'll take the first part again on 5G. What we've had so far, Phil, is we've got a big deployment down in Dallas working with Ericsson and Nokia. We've got several in New Jersey and some down in Virginia. We've typically seen speeds above 1 gigabit over, let's just say, 500 yards or less, because of the confined space that we've got available to us. With that sort of speed we've been able to put up six ultra high definition TVs, six virtually reality units, numerous tablets, et cetera. So and those services are only drawing in the 300 megs to 400 megs of throughput. So lots of head room. Now the process we're moving into now is actually going out into a field environment, where we can cover a 200 home development. And see with normal vegetation, with difference in weather patterns where we think these critical parameters are going to go. Theoretically, looks, 1,000 meters or so between cell sites seems to be reasonable. But again we've got to verify that. We're going to go into some rural environments to see whether that propagation changes based on demand. We'll know a lot more as we go along. From a pure cost perspective, again I think it's a little too early to tell. But what I'll tell you is about half of our cost to deploy Fios is in the home today. And the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop. And so our take is that with the router roughly costing the same \u2013 and remember we wouldn't have to have an ONT as we think about it today. So as the \u2013 when we deploy 4G and densify, that small cell can contain 5G for very little incremental cost. And with the router in the house being probably less than an ONT and router combination today, and losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop, we expect there to be a significant cost reduction. But we'll know a lot more as we finish these trials. And I fully expect that as we wrap these trials up, we'll actually be bringing some analysts and some of media to the field to take a look at these deployments, so that you can judge for yourself. Fran?\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then, Phil, on second part on tablets. So absolutely we view as tablets as adding value. So traditionally you would say, well a tablet that's added to a Wireless account just gives you a minimal amount of access revenue. And that's far less than a smartphone. And all that is true. But if you look at the entire ecosystem that we're developing here, more people who have tablets, we know watch more video on a tablet. And if you think about what Lowell outlined on our whole video strategy, along with go90, AOL, Yahoo coming into the portfolio fold, we're trying to drive more usage into these devices. And we want those users to consume our content, which then ultimately drives advertising. So we're looking at the value of these instruments if you will more from a holistic standpoint. So yes. I mean today it's 11.4% of the base. I still believe that there is a huge growth opportunity here in the base with tablets and where technology is going. And that's going to generate not only access revenue on the Wireless side of the house, but it's also going to generate a lot of, if you will, media co type revenue for the future portfolio of digital advertising.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. I understand. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you. Tori, if you can tee up the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nJennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Two if I may. Just following up on Phil's point. Lowell, you mentioned doing in Boston into other cities. Can I just explore that a little bit? Are you talking in your franchise footprint, your Wireline footprint, or going outside of that? Because I guess the logical next question would be outside of that, how do you work with the incumbents there if you're kind of trying to cannibalize their main business? And then secondly, if you can offer any question \u2013 or commentary on FirstNet? If you guys are there? And any thoughts on that? Thanks a lot.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. First on the cities, Jennifer. Well absolutely there's no boundary here on our Wireline footprint. Obviously, we have a stronger position in the Washington to Boston corridor. We can move to market more quickly. But we don't view that as a barrier at all. And in fact we are talking to other cities. And I mentioned San Francisco, because we made a huge deployment with the Super Bowl. And we're going to leverage that in our work with them. But there's no boundary. Now as far as cannibalization, there's an awful lot of dark fiber providers out there. And we've had a lot of discussions with them. And they're very happy to sell. And they've got very good footprints that get deep into some of these networks. As I mentioned, we've obviously just purchased XO, 40 metro fiber rings, which get us into a very strong position. And there's companies out there like XO. So we don't view any issue there. As far as FirstNet, under federal contracting rules we really can't comment about that while there's an RFP in process. So I'm sorry. I can't make any comment there.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Jennifer, thank you. Next question, Tori?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. Lowell, early on you started off talking about the importance of network. It's interesting, investors have increasingly been asking whether networks really are sufficiently differentiated versus what we've been accustomed to. And of course some of your competitors are arguing that actually there is not a lot of differentiation anymore and people should be more focused on things like price. So I was hoping we could come back to that. And then just if we think about the evolution of how you've differentiated, it used to be you differentiated on the reliability of voice. More recently it's been the reliability of data and data speeds. Where is the battleground shifting? And how are you going to make sure you continue to be differentiated based on where that's going?\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Brett, thanks. I think since we started with the original network reliability message back in 2000, those that weren't number one have constantly said networks don't matter. And customers have voted that networks do matter. And all you have to do is look at the churn. And I'd argue that if you need to sell your product at half of what Verizon sells theirs, that's proof alone that networks matter, if you have to take that sort of a haircut. I know it's shocking, but occasionally advertisements are out there that aren't completely truthful. But that's the world that we live in. As far as differentiation, as we say around the business, I think we've said this in other \u2013 I don't think it's made it to an ad yet, but, \"Can you hear me now?\" has really moved to, \"Can you see me now?\" And that's because we've moved away from voice being a channel and an application by itself on these networks to, it just rides the data stream. And so the throughputs, the latency, that's where the battleground shifts. And how we stay ahead is by densifying the 4G LTE network, but then driving very hard to 5G. Because we've seen this time and time again throughout the history of Verizon \u2013 and I'd argue throughout the history of Wireless \u2013 is if you build it, they'll come. And the more we build, the more speeds that we deliver, the more ubiquitous the network is, the customers just soak up that broadband capacity. Verizon has always been the one that is pushing the envelope here. And we continue to do that. So I hope everyone on the call sees that by aggressively moving to densification and then using that same infrastructure to build out 5G, Verizon is going to stay on the leading edge for the next decade.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi. Thank you. Two quick questions if I could. Lowell, can you talk about the FCC's Privacy NPRM and what could be significantly stricter rules for ISPs, like Verizon, relative to edge providers like Google or Facebook? Did that impact your thinking about what you could pay for Yahoo and how you monetize Yahoo in any way? And then second, just a more tactical question. Can you talk about the Fios installation backlogs coming out of the work stoppage and what we can expect with some rebound there?\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, good morning, Craig. So on the FCC Privacy NPRM \u2013 and I'd also apply this to the set top box side. We're not a big fan of regulation in general. We'd rather let the markets work. But if there's going to be regulation, then we think it ought to be for all the players in the ecosystem. And I know \u2013 and I've talked with Tom Wheeler. And I have great respect for what he's doing. He's only got so many tools in his toolbox to help set some of the standards here. But we're encouraging a broader action here that might involve the FTC or others, so that everyone in the ecosystem is treated the same. And I think that's our philosophy on set top box. That's our philosophy on privacy. Did it impact us on Yahoo? No, not particularly. We look at that as a standalone business. Certainly the regulatory environment always enters into your thinking. But we would do Yahoo regardless of however that NPRM turns out. And we think it's going to be a dynamic business for us going forward. So I hope that helps.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: Yeah, thank you.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then, Craig, on the Fios installation backlogs. Yes, obviously coming out of the \u2013 when we settled with the representative employees, there was a large backlog. I would tell you as we sit here right now today, that backlog is down to a normal. But I would say that in my prepared remarks I said we would get back to a normal growth in the third quarter. But I'll caveat that comment let's say that, look, during the strike we discontinued old advertising. And it takes about 60 days to 90 days to ramp that back up. So albeit the third quarter will be a more positive quarter for us, it probably won't be as much as a normal third quarter for us. So a little less than norm. And then we feel that we'll be back in stride by fourth quarter. So that kind of lays the land of how we think about Fios backlog and installation going forward.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, we have time for one last question. If you can place that through.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Fran, between 5G and if you look at platform and solutions, how much could this drive your overall revenue growth in 2018, 2019? Is this enough to drive almost all the GDP-like growth that you're looking for? And just maybe on the platform side, can you talk about what partners really like most about the platform and what else you're looking to do to it to kind of make it unique to attract more content partners? Thanks.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So I'll let Fran take the first part there, Tim. So the second part, I assume you're assuming Yahoo. Right?\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Correct, sorry. And AOL, yeah.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So look, I think the items that I mentioned around the sports, finance, and news are really the big items there. If you look at Tim's numbers, he's in the hundreds of millions of users. Yahoo is well over a billion users. So you start putting those numbers together, and there's some significant reach here. I think every content provider \u2013 and I think it's fair to say whether you're an advocate for the 300 channel bundle or over-the-top, you realize that this is moving more and more toward digital distribution. And the partnership of AOL and Yahoo gives them the ability to reach those specific customers. If you look at our purchase of Complex, Complex has more visitors per month now than ESPN does in that male millennial. And AwesomenessTV has those same sort of numbers for female millennials. So it gives, whether you're thinking you're part of a large network, sports distribution or you're the actual league or you're trying to deliver finance or other news, being able to tap into that is a huge opportunity. The big advertisers have come to us, saying that they have more ads to place than they have good places to put them. And so you will hear from us over the next several months some partnerships and some agreements to place ads with us. And then the final probably obvious one to everyone, but we have 113.2 million mobile users. And people are accessing all of this content via their mobile device. And we'll be one of the few that can deliver advertising and content across the home, across the mobile device, and across the Internet. And we think that puts us in a very strong position.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then, Tim, on the second part of this, I can honestly tell you that within the comments I made, there is actually nothing related to 5G as far as revenue goes. And the reason for that is, is because we looked at 2017 as a development year for 5G. By the time that we get the licenses \u2013 now we got a great ruling yesterday by the FCC on allowing us to use the leases. So that could accelerate some of that. But I will tell you to get to a commercial launch and actually start to generate revenue, I think that will come in either very late 2017 or early 2018. But there is nothing in the forecast right now based on the guidance I gave.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Okay. That's all the time for questions. But before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back to Lowell.\nLowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you, Mike, and I'd also like to thank Fran for taking us through the results. And all of the analysts, I appreciate your questions. I wish we could have gotten to more, but Mike will be available throughout the day. I know we also have a lot of reporters on the phone, and Jim Gerace and our Public Relations team will be available to answer your questions. Both Fran and I will be out visiting with our large investors over the next several weeks. So we expect to be able to tell our story and answer more questions on a number of fronts here. I realize that it's been a long call today, and we've covered a lot of topics, both operationally and strategically. But given what we said last year about 2016 being a plateau for us on earnings and given the acquisitions that we've completed \u2013 obviously Yahoo the most significant now front of us \u2013 we thought it was good to give you this sort of an overview and update. Before we end I just want to make sure we have a few points that don't get lost. The team is very focused on delivering on our fundamental operational execution. We continue to be a leader in network quality and customer loyalty and in financial performance. On the strategic front obviously we're aggressively building new businesses with revenue and ecosystems that are expanding the industry and enhancing the revenue profile of the company. Certainly we don't kid ourselves about execution. We've been executing, bringing new businesses into the portfolio since we started this back in 1999. But just as we have in the past, we're determined to lead the next growth surge and create value for our shareholders. And hopefully after today you see that path as clearly as we do. So thank you all for covering Verizon and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-04-21 14:29:12", "content": "Executives: Michael T.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mike Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tori. Good morning, and welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in the filings with the SEC. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Fran goes through these results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $1.06 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a noncash pre-tax loss of $165 million for a pension mark-to-market adjustment due to settlement accounting. We expect settlement accounting to impact earnings in each of the remaining quarters in 2016. Additionally, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $142 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis the loss on settlement accounting amounted to $102 million or $0.02 per share. And the gain on the spectrum transaction amounted to $88 million or $0.02 per share, effectively offsetting each other. Including the effect of these nonoperational items, earnings per share of $1.06 in the first quarter, compared to $1.02 per share a year ago, or a growth rate of 3.9%. There were no special items of a non-operational nature in the first quarter of 2015. As a reminder, our Wireline results for the first quarter included the operations from the three states that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016. As we have done over the past year, we have recognized a full quarter benefit of approximately $229 million pre-tax or about $0.03 per share due to these assets being classified as held for sale. This compares to $146 million pre-tax benefit or $0.02 per share that we recognized in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, the operations of AOL are not included in prior period results. With that I will now turn the call over to Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We remain confident in our three-tier strategy for long-term growth, which is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in video and Internet of Things, and create incremental revenue opportunities in applications and content. In terms of progress on this multi-tier strategy we are focused on network leadership and operating efficiency, while we develop new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things, leveraging our capabilities in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also developing a portfolio of unique content targeted at the Millennial Generation so that we can capitalize on the opportunity transforming mobile. At the network connectivity layer we consistently invest in our 4G LTE network to accommodate growth in data usage and enable customers to experience an unmatched level of connectivity. National studies continue to recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. Having the best network does matter, as reflected in our strong customer retention that we will discuss later. We are enhancing capacity and coverage by effectively managing our spectrum, further densifying areas of significant usage and implementing a number of optimization techniques, such as carrier aggregation. Approximately 92% of our total data traffic is now on the LTE network. The amount of data on the network increased at a rate of approximately 50% over the prior year. Over the long term densification of our wireless network, particularly in urban and concentrated usage areas, is required to add capacity to manage these growing consumption trends, as well as to preposition ourselves for the 5G technology of the future. A key element of this densification strategy is access to fiber. During the quarter we announced our intention to acquire XO Communications, which will provide us the opportunity to deepen and expand our fiber assets nationwide, as well as to lease millimeter wave spectrum for 5G testing purposes with the option to buy. We are also very excited about the announcement made last week to deploy a new fiber platform within the city of Boston that will support wireless and wireline technologies to consumers and enterprises across the city in a network efficient way. This approach gives us tremendous flexibility to innovate, develop and deliver services with a mix of technologies over the same fiber assets. In terms of 5G our technical testing is going well. And there is a strong interest and commitment from members of the 5G Forum to prepare for fixed wireless commercial pilots using the technology next year. Improving our operating cost structure is a priority. We will continue work on our operating model, and are confident that we can improve efficiencies as we have done in the past. We remain focused on cost reductions throughout the entire business, and are making progress in driving efficiencies, reducing overhead costs, and streamlining support. We have several initiatives that have already been taken and others that we plan to implement for 2016 and beyond. In the fourth quarter 2015 we restructured our Wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. Additionally, we continue to look at opportunities across all lines of business. You are starting to see these benefits in the first quarter. Overall, consolidated head count since the end of 2015 is down approximately 3%, as we continue to increase the efficiency of our operations. We expect to receive additional savings from a number of initiatives during the second half of 2016. We continue to streamline business support functions utilizing our Lean Six Sigma approach across the business to reduce redundancy, drive consistency, and improve speed of delivery in the market. Across Wireless we have identified opportunities to gain further efficiencies within the store operations, call center operations, and supply chain processes by simplifying our execution model, while improving the overall customer experience. Network-related opportunities exist for consolidation and elimination of unnecessary facilities to gain synergies and reduce costs. Always more work to be done here, but we are pleased with the continued progress. Our networks and operating model also enable us to grow and expand our revenue stream through new ecosystems, platforms, content, and solution layers. We are enhancing our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution, and advertising platforms across all screens. The video platform continues to expand, as we add more unique content that appeals to Millennial audiences, such as the partnership recently announced with Hearst. Our joint venture with Hearst includes developing two initial channels of video programming, targeting the digital Millennial audience to be distributed across multiple distribution platforms. Additionally, we signed an agreement to acquire and equity stake in AwesomenessTV, and entered into an agreement to create new premium content service featuring short-form mobile content that will launch initially on go90. Just over the past few days we announced the acquisition of a 50% ownership in Complex Media with Hearst. The investments in AwesomenessTV and Complex Media position us as partial owners in the number one digital media brands for young Millennials. On the go90 application we remain encouraged by the viewership of go90. But as we have said before, we are still in the very early stages of gaining traction and engagement. Verizon Wireless subscribers now have greater flexibility when streaming live sports, concerts, and (10:44) series content within go90 on their mobile devices, and can enjoy this content free of data charges with our FreeBee Data service. We look forward to expanding our go90 content to other media through our AOL brand and the Web later this year. Within the Internet of Things ecosystem we continue to develop platforms and our network to take advantage of the opportunities to innovate and offer solutions that address some of the more pressing social, economic, and business challenges. We have launched our own utility, transportation, and healthcare solutions with products like Networkfleet, Grid Wide, Verizon Share, hum, and one of our newest products, Intelligent Track and Trace. Our ThingSpace platform is set to accelerate the adoption of Internet of Things products and solutions by making it easier, faster, and more accessible to develop applications. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing with revenues of approximately $195 million in the quarter, a year-over-year increase of about 25%. While we build for the future, fundamental execution and quality financial results are a top priority. Now let's get into the first quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on slide 5. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy in the current market. We delivered strong operating and financial results by growing our quality customer base, expanding earnings, and generating solid free cash flow for the quarter. Earnings per share grew 3.9%, and free cash flow was $4 billion, which enables us to invest and return value to our shareholders. Total operating revenue in the first quarter was $32.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. AOL had its best first quarter revenues in the last 5 years, driven by growth in the platform layer. If we exclude AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line revenue declined by 1.5% for the quarter. This was due to lower wireless phone activations under device installment sales, lower upgrades, and the continued migration of our customer base to unsubsidized pricing. In Wireline the higher growth of Internet only activations and smaller video bundles also pressured revenue growth. As we manage through the revenue transformation in the Wireless and Wireline segments and develop new products and services, we remain focused on improving our overall cost structure to maintain our strong earnings profile. Consistent with the prior year consolidated EBITDA totaled about $12 billion. And our EBITDA margin was 37.2% in the quarter, which was driven by our ability to manage costs and expand margin even with the pressure on the top line. Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 6. Cash flows from operation totaled $7.4 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015 that was allocated to cash flow from operations. We continued to sell device installment receivables, and received about $2 billion in gross cash proceeds from new transactions in the first quarter. We believe that the underlying quality of our device installment receivables has been instrumental in helping the securitization program be so successful. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $4 billion. We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model, with a priority to invest for the future. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, which included approximately $150 million related to the markets that were sold to Frontier. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, down about 9.5% from a year ago, which was the result of the timing of investments. We fully anticipate capital spending for the year to be within our guided range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $109.9 billion of total debt, net debt of $104 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2 times. We completed the sale of properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016. The pre-tax proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding debt in the current quarter. In early April, we already executed tender offers and early redemptions to repay over $10 billion in debt to reduce our total debt balance. Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide 7. In Wireless, we posted a balanced quarter of quality connections growth and margin expansion. Postpaid net adds totaled 640,000 in a seasonally low volume quarter, excluding all wholesale connections, including IoT. Net phone additions were negative 8,000 for the quarter, as compared to a negative 138,000 a year ago, a significant improvement over the prior year, driven by customer retention. Retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, down 7 basis points for the quarter and sequentially consistent. We have taken many actions to improve and simplify our customer experience and provide the best network, which have resulted in improved customer loyalty and satisfaction. We ended the quarter with 112.6 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 4.4% to 107.2 million. And our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, consistent with the prior year. The majority of gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. The composition of our 640,000 postpaid net adds was very strong. Within the postpaid net adds, we added 452,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 284,000 net new smartphones. The remainder of the offset in phone net adds are basic devices. Tablet net adds totaled 507,000. Other connected devices of 176,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being a large contributor. We are beginning to see traction and increasing demand for the hum product, which we introduced last year. Net prepaid devices declined by 177,000. Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 9.9 million in the quarter, down about 3.9%. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 73.8 million smartphones in total. And our smartphone penetration increased to 85% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 81% of our retail postpaid connections base. As expected, seasonality and lower customer demand for new devices contributed to the softer volumes of upgrades in the first quarter. About 5.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter, which represents a decline from the prior year of 70 basis points. Now let's review Wireless profitability and revenue on slide 9. In the Wireless segment, profitability and cash flows were driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. In terms of profitability, we generated $10.2 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 1.7%, and had an EBITDA margin of 46.2%, an increase of 140 basis points. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 1.5% in the quarter, to $22 billion. Service revenue of $16.8 billion declined 6.2% for the quarter, as the result of the continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. Equipment revenue increased to approximately $4 billion, up 17.2% for the first quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.6% in the first quarter. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured, as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing, and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. Overall, about 48% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing plan. As we discussed previously, we believe service revenue will flatten its decline mid-year, when the base of our customers on the unsubsidized pricing plans exceeds 50%. Over the course of the next year, we expect the decline in service revenue will slow, ultimately turning positive by the end of 2017. The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to about 68% in the first quarter, compared with about 67% in the fourth quarter. The first quarter take rate fell below our expectation of more than 70%, due to customer preference, especially on upgrades, which contributed to lower equipment revenue growth. We expect the second quarter take rate for device installment plans to be around 70%. During the quarter, 5.5 million phones were activated on a device installment payment plan. We have about 28.8 million device installment phone connections in total, representing 33% of our postpaid phone base. Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review on our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 10. In the Consumer business FiOS remains the driver of revenue growth, and now represents about 81% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter consumer revenue grew 0.8%. Mass markets, which include small business, was consistent with the prior year. During the quarter FiOS total revenue grew 5% with consumer FiOS revenue growing at 4.7%. The increased penetration of Quantum and the desire for higher data speeds are the primary drivers of the FiOS growth. At the end of the quarter about 78% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. Additionally, the increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds is evident, as about 60% of our consumer FiOS Internet sales are opting for speeds at 100 megabits and above. FiOS Internet subscriber growth remained strong in the first quarter. In broadband we added 98,000 net FiOS customers for the quarter, which was consistent with the fourth quarter. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 10,000 in the quarter. In FiOS Video we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter, which improved from 20,000 net customers in the fourth quarter. The consumer revenue growth trajectory continues to decline, as customers downsize their existing bundles, and core voice services are no longer desired. We introduced the next generation of our Custom TV offering during the quarter, expanding the content and value provided by the original Custom TV offer to appeal to even wider range of value conscience customers. Customers now have a choice between selecting an Essentials plan and a Sports & More plan, with the option to select up to three additional packs. The demand for Custom TV remains strong. And during the first quarter Custom TV represented about 38% of our FiOS Video sales. Due to the lower price of the bundle and the lower content costs associated with the Custom TV, a Custom TV customer generates less revenue but contributes more margin than the traditional FiOS Video customer. Let's turn to slide 11 and cover Enterprise and Wholesale, as well as the Wireline segment in total. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.4% for the quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year due to strong cost control. Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment declined 1.9% in the quarter. In the Enterprise space secular and economic challenges remain. But we are seeing stabilization in the rate of decline on a constant currency basis. In the first quarter Global Enterprise revenue declined 3.1%. On a constant currency basis it was down about 2.6%. In our Global Wholesale business revenues declined 4% in the first quarter. Trends for both Enterprise and Global Wholesale remain consistent with 2015 results. Let's move next to slide 12 for an overview of the Wireline segment, post the Frontier transaction. Now that we have completed the sale of our Florida, Texas, and California properties to Frontier on April 1, 2016, the historical results associated with these three markets will be included in Corporate and Other, beginning with the second quarter results. For illustrative purposes on a preliminary basis we have shown fiscal year 2014 and 2015 and first quarter 2015 and 2016 recast results. We will also provide nine quarters of recast financials for the Wireline segment, excluding the three markets, later in the second quarter. Recast total revenue for the first quarter 2016, excluding these three markets, was approximately $8 billion, which is comparable to the prior year. As previously stated, we think we have tremendous opportunity to further penetrate the remaining properties from Massachusetts to Virginia with our fiber infrastructure and FiOS products. Recast Wireline margin excluding these markets decreased, as expected since these properties were more profitable that the properties that remained. Without these properties the Wireline EBITDA margin for the first quarter was approximately 19%. We have been working on our post-Frontier transaction cost structure as part of our overall cost initiatives outlined earlier. As we have stated before we are committed to offset the financial impact of this transaction, including the stranded costs at the consolidated level. Our efforts in this area can be seen in the fact that the recast Wireline margin expanded by approximately 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 to first quarter 2016. We recognize that some of the efficiencies and future savings we need in order to offset the impact this year are dependent on the timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations. Let's move next to slide 13 for an overview of our liability management. Subsequent to the Vodafone transaction and at year-end 2014, total debt was approximately $113 billion. And at the end of the first quarter 2016 our total debt was approximately $110 billion. We have been actively managing our debt portfolio entering into the second quarter of 2016. In early April 2016 we utilized Frontier proceeds plus cash on hand to complete tender offers and early redemptions of $10.7 billion of face value debt with a cash outlay of $12.5 billion. Our strategy focused on retiring higher cost debt with a range of maturities through 2043, thereby improving our maturity profile and achieving lower borrowing costs for the future. The Frontier related tax obligations, which are payable in the second half of 2016, and our remaining debt maturity of $2.3 billion in September are both very manageable within our 2016 funding plan. Through our liability management efforts and our future funding plans, we are on track to return to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by 2018 to 2019 timeframe. At the same time we are continuing to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. Since the Vodafone transaction closed, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, invested in new businesses, improved our debt profile, and returned value to our shareholders, both through an accelerated share repurchase program and through a dividend increase each year. Let's move next to slide 14 for our summary and 2016 priorities. We are off to a strong start in 2016, as we executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high value customers, delivering strong financial and operating results, and generating free cash flows. Our results demonstrate that we are well positioned to compete in a competitive environment, while effectively implementing our strategies. We remain focused on enhancing our networks and platforms to position us for future growth and on further developing new ecosystems. At the operational level we are navigating through the transition to the device installment payment model, stabilizing the trend in Wireline revenues, improving our overall cost structure, and ramping new revenue streams. At this point in the year we continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted earnings to be a level comparable to our strong full year 2015 adjusted earnings. However, given the status of our labor contract negotiations, there will be pressure on earnings in the second quarter due to the timing of cost reductions. Depending on the progress of the negotiations we may need to update the full year guidance at a later time With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Fran, thank you. Tori, we're ready to open it up for questions. If we can take the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And appreciate the color. I didn't catch it in the release. Are you guys still reporting postpaid ARPA? And if so could you break it out for us?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. We are going to continue to report postpaid IARPA. But, Brett, we'll get that out to everybody so that you can see that.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then just a separate question. You noted that you're going to be making this investment in Boston. I was hoping you could give us some thoughts around the timing of that, so we could think about how that might flow through into CapEx? And then are you thinking that there could be an opportunity to continue to expand your fiber presence, particularly as you think about densifying your wireless network? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Sure, Brett. Thanks. Well, I mean Boston is a unique situation. So we announced the intent to expand Fios in Boston. Understand that the LFA has to be negotiated with city council. And that is a public process that will take approximately 6 months. We have been in discussions with some broad framework, but we need to go through that process. It's also important to note that the LFA is only for video linear TV services. It is not required for broadband or 5G. So obviously when we looked at Boston, it was a city that we needed to densify for the LTE network. So as we looked at all of our current COs around the footprint and the fiber that we already had there, it kind of was a no-brainer to us to say, we can do the fiber bill out (31:21) to expand the LTE densification. But we also can use this opportunity with only an increment of about $300 million over the next 5 years to 6 years to expand our Fios footprint. So the $300 million, you're not even going to see it in the Wireline capital numbers. It's already there. And as far as the capital that was going to be incurred on the Wireless side of the house, that was already going to be spent, regardless of whether we expanded Fios. So we will get to this. But we are starting to \u2013 we will start this mid-year this year for especially the 5G and 4G LTE densification. We will start the Internet capability with the passing homes. But for the video product we will have to wait to go through the LFA city council process.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Is this the last significant fiber deployment you would expect to make within your remaining footprint? Or do you think that there's an opportunity to keep doing this in the Northeast?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I think what we'll have to do, Brett, is we'll take one city at a time. Obviously we still don't have Alexandria built out or Baltimore. So if we get to a position where we believe we're going to need to invest in densification in those cities, then that's an opportunity for us to take a look at it. But at this time we're concentrating on Boston.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks for taking the question.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: All right.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori \u2013 thank you. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Morning, Fran. Can you just give a \u2013 provide a little bit more clarity about your comments on Q2 and the rest of the year? Is it reasonable to take the Q1 margins, that sort of recast margins in Wireline that you've provided, as a good sort of guidepost here until you get more cost savings coming through? And maybe you can just reflect on any particular puts and takes from the strike in terms of extra costs from additional labor you might need to hire? Or conversely some cost savings? And what are you seeing so far in terms of impact on the business in terms of broadband adds, trouble reports, et cetera? And then if you have any update on your data center evaluation sale process. Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks, Simon. All right. So on guidance first and foremost, we are absolutely confident at this point in time, based on everything that we have planned and the timing of the union contract, that we can deliver on the $3.99 compared to last year. And just to set the record here, I mean again we did not give revenue guidance. We gave EBITDA margin percent guidance, and we gave EPS guidance that would be relatively comparable to 2015. So if you step back a second and look at earnings per share at 2015 coming in at $3.99, we have to keep in mind that $0.13 of that was from our assets held for sale. So really the comparable number is $3.86. And as we said we felt good about growing earnings back to that $3.99 through our normal operations results of the business. So if you take that fourth quarter and move it forward. For the first quarter $1.06, so that would mean we're $0.04 ahead of the prior year. That $0.04, which is somewhat attributed to the Frontier properties for the full quarter, will reverse in the second quarter. So if you start out your baseline from last year's reported EPS of $1.04, $0.04 is taken right off the top for that. And then as we talked there is going to be some timing on offsetting the stranded costs. And again I want to reiterate that we've always said that the stranded costs would be offset on a consolidated basis, not within total Wireline segment. So we do have some timing here. We're looking at business transformation activities. If you look at the Verizon Wireless restructure, that was part of the overall plan to contribute and offset some of the stranded cost. So you can see, we're already looking at operational efficiencies on a consolidated basis. But other things that we're looking at is around distribution centers and call centers. As you know, call centers are a very high turnover rate for employees. And with our decrease in calls coming in from our Wireless customers because of more online, more chat, more self-service, we will not hire as many customer call centers. And we'll achieve this through our attrition rates just naturally within the call center. So there's opportunity to reduce force just through the attrition rate. And then if you look at our equipment volumes, since the equipment logistics system in Wireless is mostly a variable cost system, as we look to the future and the upgrade volume, which we assume will be lower, there's going to be some cost efficiencies that we gain there. So as we look at this, there will be some timing. So Q2 will be lower than just the $0.04. But we're looking at, we will regain that in the back half of the year with some of the other things we're doing. Now finally, obviously on this, the timing of the union agreement. We have planned for that. And if it goes longer, then we will come back in mid-year. But keep in mind that we're looking at this as a long-term agreement for both providing quality jobs for our employees and returning shareholder value to our shareholders. So that's where we stand with guidance. Hopefully that clears it up a little bit.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: On the second question \u2013 or the second part of your question around the strike, yeah. At this point, it's too early to tell the impacts. I mean we've deployed thousands of management employees to take on the work. We obviously always, during this period of time, fall a little bit behind on the install work. We still see good momentum coming in from a sales perspective. So there's a little bit of a backlog there, and we'll just have to work through this. But right now, really no financial impact per se in the second quarter that I'm anticipating, unless this drags on for a much longer period of time. On the data center sale, look. I mean this is still \u2013 I would consider it exploratory. There's a lot of activity going on. But nothing at this point that I'm prepared to announce in a public forum. But we continue to explore that activity.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thanks.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. The first one, Fran, just following up on that guidance question. You highlight that, if you hadn't had the Frontier benefit last year, the earnings would have been more like $3.86. But if I do the math on the impact that Frontier is having on 2016, if you hadn't sold the Frontier asset, the earnings would be reasonably materially higher. And my math is that the year over year earnings power of Verizon, had the Frontier assets not been part of the mix here, would have been about 10%. And Street estimates are really only looking for about 3% earnings growth next year. I was wondering if you could comment on what you see as the underlying earnings power of the Verizon business as we kind of think about next year's growth, ignoring the strike issues for a second? And then just the second question, if I could, would be on upgrade rate. I didn't see it in the notes yet for this quarter. But obviously, reports are that it's been lower than normal. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see the cadence or the shape of the year with the iPhone 7 likely coming out in the back part of the year and the amount of upgrades you'd see by that point in time? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, David. So on earnings, look. I mean we've been pretty open about 2016. And of course we've got a lot of things going in a lot of different directions. I mean obviously, if you look at it, even with Verizon Wireless and the headwind of the revenue here and the transformation of the pricing model, we're still increasing the profitability of that business. And it's really the recurring revenue that we're focused in on, and the quality of our customers. On the Wireline side of the house, again you see there's pressure on top line because of Custom TV and Internet only now, versus triple play. But again, we're improving the profitability of that business. So for this year, we'll stick with what we talked about on guidance. Mike and I have been pretty open \u2013 and Lowell [McAdam] \u2013 have been pretty open about 2017. We believe we will get back to a normal growth rate in 2017. But I would not attribute it to anything that we divested or acquired. There's a lot of moving parts here, especially within the strategic portfolio, that's putting pressure on some of the bottom line. So I would not overindulge on the Frontier divestiture. I mean we've got a really good value for that, that we're going to put the cash to work, that really benefits the earnings power of this company. And that's the way I look at it. On the upgrade rate, look. I mean if you look at year over year, we're down over 400,000 units on an upgrade rate. And obviously that had a lot of impact on the equipment revenue side. But the other thing that we're seeing is, our embedded base customers are selecting the subsidy model on an upgrade basis, which is why the overall device installment plan take rate did not meet our expectation for the quarter of 70%, and fell short to 68%. So if you look at that, David, and look back to the earnings power, I mean you would think that the stronger uptake in device installment plan would drive more margin. But in fact, we missed that metric. We did lower. And we actually improved our margin overall at Wireless. So there is a lot of moving parts here. But to your question of, where do I think upgrade rates are going to go. At this point, based on what we know, we think that upgrade rates will be relatively the same as 2015. I can't talk to the fourth quarter yet, because I just don't know what the devices are going to look like in our lineup at this point in time.\nDavid William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks. Two quick ones, if I can. One, can you comment on the FCC special access reforms? How are you thinking about that? And then, two, the potential to borrow against handset receivables. What do you think is the cost in that market, Fran, versus the normal bond market?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: All right. Thanks, Phil. So on FCC special access, look. The FCC will take action this month sometime on special access rulemaking, and if tariff investigation at a certain discount that we and other large legacy providers offer for DS1s and 3s. I mean we've reached out \u2013 we reached a deal with a lot of the CLECs in order to resolve a longstanding and contentious regulatory issue here. Our top priority though is to ensure that our business services are on a level playing field with all the other competitors, including cable companies. We intend to work with the industry and the FCC to develop a framework for that, that applies to all competitors equally and relies on the sound public policy to determine where and when regulation is appropriate. So we'll wait to see what the FCC does here, Phil. And then we'll respond accordingly. On the bond market and the recent press reports coming out of Bloomberg, look. We've been pretty open and public that we have been looking at an alternative financing arrangement for our installment sale receivables. The public asset backed market is an alternative that we've explored. We've had a number of discussions. We are having discussions continuing with alternative providers and various parties. But at this point in time these are just discussions. It's something we're looking at. We're still doing a lot of analysis around it. And at this point it's just something that we continue to look at. And nothing to announce here today that we're going to change anything at this point in time.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thanks, Fran.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Two if I could. First, as you look at the range of possible investment that you can make over the next 12 months or 24 months, is there a balance sheet debt level that investors should be keeping in mind in dollars or ratio terms that \u2013 the upper threshold for what the company is comfortable with? And then secondly, as you look specifically at the performance of AOL since you purchased the asset, are there some examples that you could provide on ways in which Verizon has made the performance of that asset better in terms of revenue or cash flow? And how some of the recent content investment might further the performance of that asset? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on investment side, look. I mean we've been pretty open that our main priority is to get our debt level back to an A-minus rated company. And we are on track to do that. And everything we do, that continues to be the top priority. So even with all of the M&A activity you've seen, I mean if you look back, we started this at a pre-Vodafone debt of \u2013 post-Vodafone debt of $113 billion. We've reduced that to $109 billion. But keep in mind that was with a $10.4 billion spectrum purchase during that period of time. That was with $4 billion of a purchase of AOL and some miscellaneous tuck-ins, capital investment, share repurchase. And now we've just sold the Frontier properties. That helps brings that debt down even to a lower level. So we are right on course. But that is top of mind at everything that we do. And will continue to be a commitment that Lowell and I made that is forefront that we will commit to. On the AOL performance, look. I think \u2013 I'm not going to get into a lot of details on AOL. But look, they've had the best quarter in revenue in the last 5 years. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we said they were up $300 million year over year. Now of course that's seasonal. Well, that shows you though, that the investments that we've made in the platforms, a lot of the tuck-in type investments that we made with acquisitions \u2013 and these are small acquisitions. But they're real critical. I mean if you just look at the most recent acquisition we just did with RYOT, this is a real unique 360-degree video production. It is for really Huff Post [Huffington Post], for them to increase their viability on producing videos for news. But again this goes to our strategy in attacking a certain population that quite honestly Verizon is underpenetrated in. And if you look at that acquisition it directly goes to Gen Z. 73% of their audience is Millennials. So these are real strategic for us to improve the viability of that platform. The other thing you're going to see us do this year too is around go90. The go90 product will start to \u2013 across all of the AOL platforms this year. That is going to enhance both the AOL platforms, and it's also going to enhance the go90 platform. So look, continuing with our strategy we will \u2013 as I said before we will open the box at some point in time to give you more visibility to this. And I continue to say that that will be mid-year to maybe third quarter of this year, where we'll start to produce some numbers around some of these more specific platforms that we talk about.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And, Fran, is there a ratio or set of numbers you could put around how you perceive getting to that A-minus debt level? Are there indications that you've received for that?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well sure. I mean if you look at each of the rating agencies, each of the rating agencies have a different approach, because some of them include the pension plan unfunded liability. Others include the OPEB unfunded liability. Others don't include any of that. Securitization, some include, some don't. So each of them is a different metric. But if you look at our overall GAAP ratio, it kind of follows in task with where we would need to be. And based on the GAAP ratio, you should look at a 2.0 to 2.1 (47:42) type area in order to achieve that A-minus rating.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi. Good morning. Let me see if I can tie together maybe a question about the FCC and the ongoing discussions about Yahoo!. Given that in the FCC right now you've got the privacy NPRM, and you've got some uncertainty around whether Wireless is or isn't going to be upheld under Title II. How does that inform the way you think about what you might be able to do with AOL directly I guess? And also trying to expand the platform of advertising, as you might do with Yahoo! if you're the acquirer?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Well, look. I mean I'm not going to speak anything to deal with Yahoo!, so let's just talk about what we have on the table today. And under the sponsored data zero rating type issue, I mean the net neutrality already advocates some of this. And we've structured our sponsored data program to comply with all the FCC net neutrality rules. So for example if any party \u2013 third party \u2013 is interested in that, we will offer that on a non-discriminatory basis. And we've priced it accordingly at a commercially favorable rate that we believe is in direct, really, compliance with the FCC net neutrality rule. We think that sponsored data and other FreeBee Data programs are good for the consumer. And that regulators will recognize that after concluding their review on our product. So based on the zero data, we'll have to wait to see where they come out on that. As far as Title II goes, look. I mean we agree with all the principles with net neutrality rule. The thing that we disagreed with and opposed was applying Title II to broadband services and particularly wireless broadband. So we'll have to see where this comes out. But in re-classing broadband under Title II was not necessary to ensure an open Internet. I mean there has been nothing ever that shows that it not has been an open Internet. So this will obviously have some negative consequences on innovation as a whole. But look. I mean we're a company that has operated under regulation for 100 years. And it has been very successful. So we'll wait to see what the FCC concludes. And then we'll operate accordingly. But it's too early to say what exactly is going to happen here.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: And, Fran, does the specific limitations that might or might not be imposed on the use of customer data under the privacy NPRM that stems from reclassification, does that impact your ability to monetize an asset like Yahoo! or AOL in general to \u2013 as you think about how you would use that for advertising purposes?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, look. I mean we at Verizon \u2013 I mean privacy and security has always been top of mind. And normally we always use an opt-in with our customers or some type of an opt-out feature. The issue though that we have right now is under the FCC proposed aggressive rules on privacy and data security, that would apply to broadband providers but not companies like Google and Facebook. So if we're going to have rules, we need to make sure we don't single out certain industry to either benefit or not benefit from those rules. And that's something that our legal department continues to work with the FCC on. And so we'll see where this ultimately comes out. But that's really the crux of the issue for us.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: All right. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. Fran, maybe you could comment on the competitive environment you're seeing in Wireless? You guys were able to cut your postpaid handset losses on a year-over-year basis pretty meaningfully. Do you expect that to continue through the year? And then secondly, prepaid has always been an area where you guys haven't really focused. You continue to lose subs in that space. Meanwhile I think AT&T and T-Mobile are \u2013 see a lot of growth in that area. Maybe you could compare your views on that market? And why you guys don't see that as a source for growth? Thanks.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Sure. Thanks, John. So on the competitive environment of Verizon. I mean, look, coming into 2015 and again in 2016 we said that the top priority would be to maintain the high quality of our base. And you see us doing that. I mean we now have 48% of our base over on the new pricing. And we continue to push for that. So you saw this 7 basis point increase in churn for the last couple of quarters. What I would say though is, is if you look ahead, last year second quarter, the churn was like a 0.90%. I would not anticipate nor should you anticipate that we will achieve that churn rate again, because things have kind of flattened out now. So I would look at the first quarter as a guide to where we will be for the rest of the year from a churn perspective. And part of that is, is because we are seeing some increased churn on tablets, which we have talked about before, where we gave a free tablet away. And we saw that the customer base just didn't see the value of that tablet when it was free. And they signed up for the 2-year agreement, because they got a tablet for $10 a month, so $240. And they disconnected it at the end of the agreement. So we stopped doing that promotion for that reason. But you see some of these tablets now coming up on the 2-year deal. So we anticipate that some of that higher churn, that tablet environment will hit us over the next couple of quarters. So we should be prepared for that. But as far as the smartphone churn, we are continuing to see improvement in that smartphone churn, which gets us to holding a flat churn rate overall. So I think that's really what's important to us right now is that smartphone churn rate, which is really where we're dedicating all of our concentration and our promos. On the prepaid side, absolutely. I mean our retail prepaid is above market. We're really not competitive in that environment for a whole host of reasons. And it's because we have to make sure that we don't migrate our high quality postpaid base over to a prepaid product. If you look at the competitive nature, they're doing it with sub-brands. They're not really doing it with their brands. And quite honestly we use the TracFone brand as our prepaid product. And TracFone has been extremely successful for us. It's not something that we disclose any more on reseller. But it continues to increase on the high quality base of TracFone. So that's really where we use and go after the prepaid market. More to come on this during the year. But currently that's how we operate under the prepaid model.\nJohn Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Fran.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Hey, Fran. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on what your view is maybe more holistically on the video landscape? What other assets do you think Verizon requires? And I'm thinking about Fios Video long term. Where does that go? And then I guess on the service revenue stabilization, that 50% benchmark. What kind of factors have you built into that to get to that expectation?\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Thanks, Mike. So on the video landscape, look. I mean I think we've set the bar on where we're going on video, both in the home and outside the home. So in the home we were the first to come out with our Custom TV package, which rebundled certain content. And it's been very successful. I mean this quarter, even with the rebundle of Custom TV, we had a 38% take rate on that bundle. And what I will tell you is, yes, it does give us some top line pressure, because it's a lower bundle from a revenue perspective. But the content cost is considerably lower. Therefore, it generates actually more margin for us. So it's the right thing to do. This is what customers want. They don't want to pay for 300 channels anymore and only watch 17 on average. So we're trying to give customers what they want. And that's a fight, obviously, with all the content providers. But we're doing it within the legality of our contracts. And of course, we won't breach any of our contracts. But it's the way that the environment is moving. So I don't think we're going to change any approach to our in-home delivery. The other thing is, is there's confusion out there on the video side, which is, everybody wants to talk about taking in-home video to a mobile handset. And this is something new. This has been done for the last 2 years. Everybody who has an in-home subscriber, most rights give them the ability to view that content as long as they subscribe and authenticate to that subscription, they can watch that on their mobile handset. We're taking the \u2013 really the strategy in a whole different \u2013 in a different mode. We're going to a mobile-first strategy outside the home. It has nothing to do with in-home content. Now some of the content you could watch at home could be on this for like sports. That has been very popular in the go90 environment. But we're looking at a lot of different mobile first, short clips, news, sports. And if you think about it, original content. And if you look at the strategy that we have taken in the last couple of quarters, we've added a lot of content that has nothing to do with in-home. So if you look at our Hearst joint venture, we now have joined in with them to create two very exclusive channels for us. One is called RatedRed, one is called Seriously.tv. And the target population is 12 to 24. We then, as I said in my preambled remarks, AwesomenessTV, we took a 25% ownership stake. Because what we saw was, there was certain original content that we had contracted with them, that they deployed in go90. And we saw viewership really jump when those original contents presented themselves. So this is another one where \u2013 number one digital brand within the female population of ages 12 to 24, 160 million views, up 53% year over year. And then finally, if you look at what we just did within the last few days, entering into another joint venture with Hearst and buying Complex [Media], a 50% owner. This is another number one digital brand in the male population of 18 to 24, monthly unique viewers of 54 million, and over 300 million views per month. So this is really where we're taking the video product on mobile, which is very different than what everyone else is talking about. And we believe that's where we are going to be a differentiated brand with go90 and AOL, and everything else that we're doing around that video platform. So that's kind of where we're at on that. On the service revenue stability, look, Mike, we've done a lot of modeling. We consistently say, as soon as we get to a more than 50% penetration of that base on the \u2013 what I'll call the device installment pricing plans, we start to see service revenue flatten out. And we start to see accretion at the back end of 2017. And we've run a number of models. And we consistently see that model towards that end. So that's really where we're at at this point in time.\nMike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Great, Fran. Thanks for the color.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Tori, we have time for one more question, please. Can you please just queue that up?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Our final question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good morning, folks.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Morning, Amir.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I was wondering if we could discuss your network plans, Fran. In the near term, as you mentioned, your CapEx was down high single digits during the quarter. But you remain fully committed towards your guidance levels. What initiatives are top of mind for what seems to be an implied improving spending trajectory through the year? And I guess longer term, I was wondering if you could briefly discuss some of your initiatives on 5G? You folks clearly seem to be pushing a timeline that is well ahead of your domestic peers and most of the global players as well. What is the impetus for this focus? And in order to meet the timeline you expect, what type of assets do you think you need to ensure to be able to get to meet those expectations? Should we expect additional deals like XO? Or some organic investments in fiber? Or anything along those lines? Thank you.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: All right, thanks, Amir. So first on just the CapEx, look. There's some timing here. And the reason that is, is because, if you look at it, in the fourth quarter of last year, we really accelerated our spend, really in Wireless, to prepare for the Super Bowl. And that was a whole densification project on the West Coast, around San Francisco and Santa Clara. So really what you're seeing here is a timing issue. We are right on track with our plans on densification. We are still deploying a lot of small cells. So there is nothing that I'm going to say here that should concern you about our plans. And you'll see us catch up on that spend in the second and through the third and the fourth quarter. So, coming in right on guidance. Now the only thing I will say here is, keep in mind that the first quarter also had $150 million on Frontier that will disappear in the second quarter. So you could assume that second quarter may be a little lighter than in the past. But again, right on track with where we thought we would be. On the 5G question, look. We are committed to being the first U.S. company to roll out 5G wireless technology. We are currently what I would call doing sandbox \u2013 sandboxes and creating innovation centers. We are working with the 5G Technology Forum, which includes all the major OEMs and handset OEMs. We will evolve this 5G ecosystem rapidly, just like we did with LTE, to ensure an aggressive pace of innovation. Currently we're testing 5G technologies this year. And we aim to have an initial fixed wireless pilot starting in 2017. And I want to reiterate that. This is a fixed wireless, which is really one of the first cases that we see. It's really not about mobile. It's really around fixed wireless. We're helping the industry to adopt the rules on 5G deployment, including the opening of the spectrum bands above the 24 gigahertz. And we're working with the FCC. And as you know with XO, we have the ability for an option to buy around the 28 gigahertz, which is currently how we're doing our testing right now. And then, keep in mind that 5G is not a replacement technology of 4G. So this is not a capital intense overlay to the 4G network. It really is all about high speed video delivery over a wireless network in a very, very efficient way. And you should think about 5G again, like we did with LTE, where you see those four to five incremental cost decreases when delivering that video. That's similar to what we will see in the 5G environment. So right now that's where we're at. But we continue to plow forward. And we will be ready to go with the 5G technology.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you. We'll now turn the call back to Fran for some closing comments.\nFrancis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Mike. Look, the first quarter provided strong results to the start of this year. And again I want to reiterate we are very confident in our ability to execute on the fundamentals and grow this business profitably amidst the competitive environment and manage through the transition of our business models. We are also positioning our business for future profitable growth through cost and capital efficiency initiatives and all the new revenue streams that we always talk about. We look forward to a positive 2016 with confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, create value for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders. Thank you again for joining Verizon this morning. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell.\nLowell McAdam: Thank you Brady, and good morning everyone. I wanted to join today's call to talk about 2017 results, the implications of tax reform to Verizon and then to talk about our strategic priorities for 2018. Let me start off by recapping our impressive performance this year. I am proud of the focus and the execution from our team in 2017. We regained positive momentum in the marketplace and delivered strong operational and financial results. We launched and expanded the most reliable unlimited experience for our customers, executed the world\u2019s largest successful 5G pre-commercial trial, invested in assets and platforms for the future and gained significant traction in the integration of new businesses. We finished the year with great momentum in the fourth quarter as evidenced by our smartphone net additions and reoccurring levels of outstanding customer loyalty. In addition, the improvement in our wireless service revenue trajectory positions the business for growth moving forward. The integration of new businesses is accelerating our mobile-first digital strategy and providing a platform for global reach. In 2017 we made significant progress with our Oath assets as we build engaging brands around the key pillars of news, sports, finance and lifestyle and we leverage the Oath capabilities across all of our Verizon properties. The game changing content and technology partnerships that we recently announced with the NFL and NBA are great examples of how we are accelerating our digital right strategy with Yahoo sports and Verizon\u2019s family of digital media brands. We are becoming the first screen for fans of live sports and superior partners for advertisers positioning us to show live-action in the engaging ways people want to consume video content. We are investing for the future while maintaining a well-rounded approach to funding all aspects of our business. We enhanced our financial profile in 2017 with a number of transactions that strengthened the balance sheet that included lowering our borrowing cost, extending out our debt maturities and making a significant voluntary contribution to the pension fund. Now let's take a look forward. We ended the year with the president signing tax reform into law effectively restructuring the tax code for U.S. corporations. Verizon has long supported corporate tax reform that reduces rates to globally competitive levels and we are very pleased to see this legislation passed. The new tax law will have a positive impact to Verizon\u2019s cash flow and earnings profile. We expect tax reform to enhance our cash flow from operations in 2018 by approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion. We have been disciplined in our approach to capital allocation since the inception of Verizon. We have always been focused on keeping our network the gold standard and investing in the business for growth while strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining strong dividend performance for our shareholders. This will continue to be the driving force behind the use of cash savings from tax reform. And by strengthening the balance sheet it will give us the flexibility to execute our strategies going forward. Our employees drive the innovation and success of our business, so it is vital that we all share in the success of not only tax reform but the overall performance of Verizon. We will provide details on how we are investing in our employees later today, and will provide those details outside the company later today. We are good corporate citizens and share our success with the community. In 2017, Verizon and its foundation donated $75 million for disaster recovery and community projects. We will increase our contributions to the Verizon foundation by $200 million to $300 million over the next two years with the additional funds being dedicated to our efforts around human ability. And by human ability we mean applying our technology to making our customers lives better. Combined these two initiatives will have an approximate $0.05 to $0.06 impact to our earnings per share for each of the next two years. As we head into 2018 our strategic priorities remain clear and are unchanged. The cornerstone of our strategy continues to be our best in class wireless network, which continues to be ranked number one in the nation in both voice and data network quality. Our unbroken run of JD Power and RootMetrics awards keeps getting longer. In our history, Verizon has always been in the forefront of technology innovation. We have led the transformation of the wireless industry from analog to today's fourth generation LTE service. Now we have an unprecedented opportunity in front of us as we drive the evolution of the U.S. wireless industry to the fifth generation of mobile services. Not too long ago people were saying 5G would not be possible until sometime between 2020 and 2022. Only one carrier has been consistent in its actions and messaging regarding 5G. Verizon has the spectrum bandwidth needed to provide the rich services of true 5G, our intelligent edge network capabilities and engineering know-how to lead the industry in providing the full suite of 5G gigabit services. The investment and pre-positioning of assets that we have accomplished will enable us to deliver the full range of 5G services including mobility, residential broadband, sub-millisecond latency applications, and other advanced consumer and IoT use cases. We have flexed our innovation muscle and are now taking 5G from a mere possibility to commercial reality by bringing 3 to 5 cities online this year with commercial services. The next industrial revolution will be on Verizon\u2019s network and will positively impact society like no technology we have seen before. As we say around our offices, we don't wait for the future. We build it, and we are doing it again with 5G. Now I will hand the call over to Matt to talk about the financial and operating details of the business starting with Slide 4.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Lowell. It is great to be with you today and to share the results of our strong performance. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we reported earnings of $4.56 per share and full year earnings of $7.36 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $2.6 billion. This net loss consists of severance and mark-to-market adjustments for pension and OPEB liabilities of $1.2 billion, early debt redemption costs of $681 million, a charge for product realignment around early stage developmental technologies of $671 million, acquisition and integration related charges of $154 million pertaining mainly to Yahoo, and a non-cash pre-tax gain on spectrum license transactions of about $144 million. Additionally, as noted in our 8-K filing last week, the new tax law resulted in a one-time benefit of approximately $16.8 billion, or $4.10 per share. This benefit is primarily related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% corporate income tax rate. The cumulative net impact from these items after-tax was approximately $15.2 billion or $3.71 per share. Excluding the full effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 in the fourth quarter, which is flat compared to our performance in the same quarter a year ago. For the full year adjusted earnings per share was $3.74. Now let us move to a summary of the consolidated financial highlights of the quarter on Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue was $34 billion, an improvement of 5% and for the full year 2017 revenue was $126 billion. On a comparable basis, excluding divestures and new businesses, adjusted operating revenues declined approximately 2% for the year. For the full year, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items totaled approximately $45.1 billion and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.7%, slightly higher than last year's margin of 35.5%. Let us turn now to our wireless results on Slide 6. Our value proposition of providing unlimited service on the best network together with the simplicity of our offers is driving increased engagement from our valued customers. In the fourth quarter, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.7% to $23.8 billion, our first positive year-over-year growth in two years. For the full year, operating revenue totaled $87.5 billion, a decline of 1.9%. The sequential results in service revenue increased for the second consecutive quarter by 0.2% to $15.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, service revenues declined by 2.9%, a marked improvement over the same period last year. The improved trends to service revenues are attributed to several factors, including increased access revenues and new account formation. Our postpaid phone base migrations to un-subsidized service pricing are progressing and now represent approximately 80% of our postpaid phone base, approaching steady-state as most of our business customers remain on subsidized plans. In the fourth quarter, equipment revenue increased to $6.5 billion up 12.9% for the quarter and 7.8% for the full year. At the end of the quarter approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance. During the quarter we generated $9.5 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 9.6%. Wireless EBITDA margin was 39.8% compared to approximately 36.9% in the same period last year. As expected, the improvement in EBITDA was a function of better trends in service revenue and lower promotional activity than the prior year. For the full year, we generated $38.6 billion of EBITDA on total revenues of $87.5 billion. Now let us turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter, total smartphone net adds were 647,000 compared to 456,000 last year. Total postpaid net adds were 1.2 million, including phone adds of 431,000, 193,000 tablets and 550,000 other connected devices, predominantly wearables. For the third consecutive quarter we increased customer accounts adding 40,000 to our base. For the full year, postpaid net additions of 2.1 million included 774,000 phones, 31,000 tablets, and 1.3 million other connected devices. Our competitiveness in 2017 was highlighted by smartphone net adds of 1.8 million, up 34% versus the prior year. The overall experience of pairing our unlimited plan with the best network continues to resonate with our customer base, resulting in outstanding retail postpaid churn of 1.00%, and phone churn of 0.77% in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, postpaid churn improved by 10 basis points driven primarily by strong phone results. In the quarter, postpaid device activations totaled 12.4 million down from 13.1 million last year. About 82% of these activations were phones with wearables accounting for the majority of the other device activations. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2%, up sequentially as expected but was lower compared to the prior year. We are seeing an elongation of the upgrade cycle as more customers hold onto their devices for a longer period. During the quarter, 8.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Pre-paid net additions declined by 184,000 compared to a decline of 9,000 in the prior year. Our smartphone prepaid base increased during the quarter. All of the decline in prepaid net additions was due to basic prepaid phones as we have deliberately reduced our focus in that area. We ended 2017 with 116 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 1.9% to 111 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million for the year. Let us move next to our wireline segment on Slide 8. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment increased 0.1% in the quarter and 0.6% for the full year. On an organic basis, excluding revenues from our XO acquisition, segment revenues declined in the quarter by 3.6%. Growth from our high quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. Consumer markets\u2019 revenue decreased 1.4% in the quarter as Fios internet growth was overshadowed by declines in video and copper. For the full year, consumer revenues grew by 0.2%. Consumer Fios revenue grew by 1.7% in the quarter. Fios revenue growth is primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher internet speeds, including our gigabit connection launched early in 2017. In the quarter, we added 47,000 Fios internet customers. We now have a total of about 5.9 million Fios internet subscribers representing a 40.1% penetration rate. In Fios video, the business faced ongoing headwinds as observed throughout the linear TV market. The Fios video business ended with 29,000 subscriber losses in the quarter and 75,000 for the year. Our multiuse fiber initiative is progressing as expected. This provides the foundational layer for multiple ways to interface with a wide array of customers and is the cornerstone of our intelligent edge network. We launched our partnership with Boston in 2016 and are seeing good results in that area. We announced our public private partnership with Sacramento in June of 2017, and you will see more activity from us on this front as progressive municipalities work with Verizon to bring new technologies to their communities. For the quarter, excluding XO, Enterprise Solutions revenue decreased 4.1%. New customer wins and growth in advanced communications products were more than offset by secular and pricing pressures in our legacy offerings and technologies. Partner Solutions revenue, excluding XO, decreased 5.8%. Strong demand for fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business. In business markets revenue declined 5.6% without XO. We are competing and winning with our fiber-based products but continue to see declines in legacy technologies. Segment EBITDA margin was 20.9% for the quarter and 21.1% for the year. Our commitments, operational gains and efficiencies in the business were largely offset by content cost escalations producing a stable margin profile. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 9 to discuss our media and Telematics businesses. Our integration efforts for the Oath assets are progressing ahead of schedule. We remain focused on exploiting synergies across all of that media assets to create a streamline platform with rich engaging content and simple functionality. For the quarter Oath revenue is $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately 10% sequentially. As expected revenue trends were driven by increase appetizing spend during the holiday season and we expect to see the normal seasonality from fourth quarter to first quarter. Our Telematics business which includes Fleetmatics and Telogis continues to grow. Total Telematics revenue increased to just over $230 million. IoT revenues increased approximately 8% in the quarter on an organic basis. Our solution set is evolving as our engagement with municipalities gains more momentum with increasing multi-use fiber deployments and the commercial rollout of 5G services. Let's move next to Slide 10 to discuss our cash flows. In 2017 cash flow from operations totaled $25.3 billion including the $2.1 billion net after tax discretionary pension funding and the $6.0 billion impact from completing the transition to on balance sheet device payment receivable financing. On a year-over-year basis our cash flow has improved by $2.5 billion. As expected full year capital expenditures were $17.2 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $8.1 billion and does not include $4.3 billion of proceeds from asset backed securitizations. The transition to on balance sheet accounting for device payment plan receivables and funding is now substantially complete. Changes going forward will mostly reflect seasonality and wireless equipment volumes. We ended the year with $117.1 billion of total debt comprised of $108.2 billion of unsecured debt and $8.9 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Our new term unsecured maturities are modest to $2.3 billion through the end of 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us the financial flexibility to methodically investor growth in the business.  Now let's take a look at 2018 on Slide 11. As Lowell mentioned upfront out strategic priorities of 2018 are clear. Our focus is on executing on the fundamentals which positions the business\u2019 strong performance in the upcoming year. We expect year-over-year consolidated revenue to grow at low single-digits in 2018 on a GAAP reported basis. Excluding the impact from the near revenue recognition standard we are on track to achieve year-over-year wireless service growth by the middle part of 2018. As we disclosed in our January 17, 2018 8-K filing the new revenue standard will negatively impact wireless service revenue. Inclusive of the new standard we expect wireless service revenue growth to turn positive towards the end of 2018 or early 2019. The benefits of our business excellence initiative included the deployment of zero based budgeting will begin to show up in our results in 2018. We expect low single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share which includes the diluted impacts from the full year of depreciation and amortization cost from 2017 acquisitions. The straight path acquisition expected to close later in the first quarter. And the ongoing impact of the last year's data centered divestitures. This is before the impact of tax reform on the revenue recognition standard. In terms of tax legislation we expect the savings to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion uplift to cash flows from operations in 2018 and is expected to yield a $0.55 to $0.65 increase to EPS in 2018. [Net of our] employee initiative and contributions to the Verizon foundation that Lowell mentioned earlier. The resulting 2018 effective tax rate for Verizon is projected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Lowell stated earlier there are internal capital decision process and return objectives have not changed. We are consistent and methodical in our allocation. We expected consolidated capital spending to be between $17.0 billion and $17.8 billion including the commercial launch of 5G. With that I will turn the call back over to Brady, so we can get your questions.\nBrady Connor: Thank you Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan. You may go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi, thanks. One for Matt and one for Lowell if I can. First Matt, I wonder if you can talk about the company's target leverage and is there any change in your thoughts or the discussions with the rating agencies on what appropriate EBITDA multiple when your conversion from EBITDA to cash flow is now substantially better because of lower taxes and then Lowell can you please discuss Verizon\u2019s view of the attractiveness of media assets in general? A year ago you offered a definitive no on any interest in buying big media and yet Verizon has been thrown out as a potential buyer and nearly every media M&A story of 2017 which has probably been confusing for your investors. Can you just give us an update? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Good morning Phil. I will take the first question. So the target leverage we haven't specified an exact number there but as we have said consistently we want to strengthen the balance sheet. The additional proceeds from the benefit of tax reform allow us to get there little faster. The key here is to have a strong balance sheet that allows us to pursue and execute on our strategy as quickly and as efficiently as we can. So as we say we haven't given an exact leverage target but you should expect us to deleverage from where we are today. We said previously getting into the same type of profile that we had prior to the Vodafone transaction, so I think that gives you a general review at the direction we would like to head. In terms of the rating agencies not had any specific conversations with them since tax reform happened about how that may change their views but certainly it gives us the ability to bring the leverage down at a little faster rates and we look forward to doing that through [\u201818] and we will continue to have conversations with them and put the balance sheet in a place where it continues to support the business.\nLowell McAdam: And Phil, good morning. I guess my first comment is I guess it's nice to be loved. So there certainly is a lot of interest here which frankly we ignored. But I think in seriousness there is a lot of movement in this area right now and we don't even know whether AT&T is going to get approved. It's clear that the messages that Disney and Fox are sending is that scale matters. So we look at this but you have to take a look at whether being a big independent distributor is a reasonable alternative to owning content. And I think until all of this shakes out you really can't determine whether that's a path we would be interested in but I can say unequivocally there is nothing going on right now without considering a large media play. In fact if you look at our actions things like the NBA and the NFL announcement that we have made in the last few weeks we think being a great partner being able to monetize through advertising and being independent is a very good place to play for us right now. And that's still further notice that's what our investors should assume we are doing.\nPhilip Cusick: That's helpful. Thanks Lowell, thanks, Matt.\nLowell McAdam: Brad, let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much and good morning. And one for Matt and Lowell as well. Matt, can you just help us with the math from Q4 to Q1 around the revenue recognition. You're moving some revenues from service revenues to equipment and then you should get at least a temporary EBITDA and EPS left. If you can just give us a little bit more color around what we should be modeling there. And then Lowell, you obviously went through the 5G role in a lot of detail in November or a couple of months past. Can you give us a little bit more clarity about what we should be expecting for the rest of the year, when should we see Sacramento launching, what about announcing from the other cities? How many pops should we be expecting covered in 2018 and then into '19? Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Simon. So, I'll take the first part of that on the adoption of revenue recognition. So, a couple of things that firstly we created an opening balance sheet adjustment to reflect some of the treatment of open contracts, assuming they had been recorded under the new standard. Remember, unlike most adoption of accounting standards, the prior periods are not being recast and so you'll have it all difference between the accounting standards for the 2018 numbers versus the 2017 comparison. You'll see that so as we go through the year. And we report '18 on the new standard. We'll also give a view as what '18 would have looked like if it's been under the old standard as well. So, in terms of breaking those pieces apart as we said in AK last week, total revenue won't have any significant impact from the change but there will be a change in geography. We'll record more equipment revenue unless service revenue initially based off that change and how we treat contracts that are still subsidized which is primarily our B2B contracts. And in the biggest impact of the EBITDA line's going to come from how we treat commissions and rather than taking those commission expenses and expensing them immediately when they're incurred, they'll get spread over the life of or the estimated life of the underlying customer contract. Now, the opening balance sheet adjustment is only for the open contracts that had a 24-month commitment or promo cost. So, it doesn't relate to all of the contracts. So, that's why you'll see a build-up in that over the next two years. So, we said the net benefit in '18 to be about $0.9 billion to $1.2 billion because of the change in accounting standards; most of that coming from the commission's line. We didn\u2019t break it up by quarter but I think you should expect it not to be too dissimilar from quarter-to-quarter as we go through the year. And then the impact in '18 would be bigger than it will be in '19 and then it'll be largely immaterial by the time we get to '20 because that contract asset builds up on the balance sheet. We'll reach a plateau level where the ins and outs are equal, by the time we get into '18 they won't be materially different. So, hopefully that answers your question on rev rec.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nLowell McAdam: Okay, and Simon on 5G. As you indicated, we shared a lot of information in November. The trials are continuing to go extremely well for us. We have more than 200 sites up online. We continue to learn every day. The distances that we shared are and the throughputs are very consistent up to about 2000 feet, which is much better than we expected. We're doing more testing around throughputs. We're seeing 10 Gigabits of peak throughputs. So, we're very comfortable with being able to deliver a gigabit of service at everyone that we're providing service to. As you may have seen the new standard, the global standard was approved in December and we've announced with Qualcomm bringing chips online that will fit that standard in the second half of '18. So, we will be deploying with our proprietary standard but also very quickly in '18 coming on with the global standard as well. If you saw what was going on at CES, there was a lot of discussion about devices and we believe that there will be mobile devices late in 2018 and then more available as we get into 2019. If you saw just last week, the FCC approved our purchase of straight path and so we're excited about moving that forward to close. So, as far as execution goes and pops, we're placing the fiber that we need now as we shared and I know you were there. In November, we shared the number of incremental sites that you need over a densified 4G network, is much smaller than we had expected. So, we're not seeing that sort of capital intensity that some were assuming. So, as you indicated, we've announced Sacramento. We have three to five plan for the year. I am personally out meeting with some of the mayors talking about what we're going to be providing and the reception has been extremely positive. So, as you know, it takes a little while to work through the city governments and get these things approved. But Sacramento is a terrific model for us. We continue to build that partnership and I wouldn\u2019t suspect it'll be too much longer before you'll see the other cities announce. And then we can be more specific on pops. But as far as capital goes, Matt told you what our guidance was for the year. We are reallocating the capital that we have been spending. We don\u2019t see any upward pressure of this in this year. And we'll be able to determine the return on invested capital as we go through these trials in these commercial launches and we'll share more information as the year moves along.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much.\nLowell McAdam: Okay, Brad. Let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks, guys. Either for from Matt or Lowell. Can you guys talk about the low single-digit GAAP earnings guidance which I assume includes straight path and the $0.5 to $0.6 from increase in the charitable contribution? Talk about the some of the underlying drivers of that. You've seen wireless cap our EBITDA margins continue to move up, some pressure on the wireline side. Is that what we can expect for 2018 and talk about how you see that the competitive environment evolving in the wireless market that may support continue to increase in margins on that side? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, John. Good morning. So, year-end ago we talked about the low single-digit GAAP earnings. And we talked about a few below-the-line items in the straight path will be dilutive because we're largely paying for that transaction in shares. And you will see an uptick in D&A cost because of the transactions we did last year. But we're confident the underlying earnings are improving. You're seeing that come through the service revenue on the wireless side to the business. You saw that number improve to just a negative 2.9 in the fourth quarter. And then we said on an apples-to-apples basis getting back to flat-to-positive by the middle part of the year. So, excited that we've completed that journey of transitioning the base and look forward to continuing to see wireless revenue growth from there. Wireline, I think in 2018 will be on a similar trajectory that you've seen in the past couple of years. Although as we continue to deploy more fiber in the network, it gives us opportunities to replace some of those earnings that were on copper based products with fiber based products which should be more sustainable going forward. So, net you should certainly see an improvement in the earnings profile of the company versus the last couple of years. And then you mentioned the charitable contribution in your comment. I want to be clear that the guide is before the impact of tax reform and revenue recognition and when we say before the impact of tax reform we also mean the net impact of tax reform which includes the contribution to the foundation and the employee piece. So, the low single-digit EPS guide is before that $0.5 to $0.6 impact of those couple of initiatives Lowell described, which is baked into that $0.55 to $0.65 positive impact from tax reform. So, hopefully that gives you a little more clarity on the moving parts within there. But it's built off the underlying earnings profile been stronger year-over-year.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nLowell McAdam: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. I've got two follow-ups here around the impact of tax reforms. You talked a bit about how you're going to be taking advantage of some of the benefits you're going to see. I'm curious if we could expand on that. Do you see an opportunity to maybe reinvest some of the savings in your competitive behavior meaning we've had kind of a com period here to end of year, you've invested a lot in your business? Is there an opening here for you to maybe spend a bit more to get customers revisit your network or even just to get your existing customers to maybe move into newer devices, whether it can take advantage of some of your network investments even making recently. And then just also, we're kind of hoping that at a broader corporate level you'll see a lot of changes in behavior. You obviously have relationships with large enterprises. I know its early days but in your discussions with them, are you seeing any green shoes that perhaps will start increasing investments in their businesses and ways that can maybe have a positive lateral implication for your enterprises services segment down the road? Thanks.\nLowell McAdam: Okay. Well, let me start out Brett, on that, and then Matt and certainly add in. on the competitive front, you've been around me for years. I have said from 1983, when I got involved in telecom and wireless, that it's an extremely competitive market. And that competition can come from different places at different times but it's always very strong. Verizon has never been one to lead the market down from a price perspective and we're certainly not going to change that now. Our focus inside the business is to use the assets that we have in our portfolio today like owe to be competitive in ways that the others can't compete. And as we roll 5G out, we see much more opportunity to be innovative as a way to be competitive versus using tax reform to just take our prices down. Now, on your enterprise front. I think we've all been very pleased at how the market and the economy has run up here since tax reform. And just like we're positioning ourselves to be able to execute and accelerate our strategies, I see other businesses doing the same thing. And telecom is such an important part to the productivity measures of a lot of these enterprises, we do see the opportunity to pick this up. But we remember we're only 30 days end of the tax reform process and we're all trying to understand the implications and what we can accelerate and how we can accelerate. So, where we build our fiber, where we're deploying 5G, what enterprises are telling us they want to do with our Intelligent Edge Network is influencing where we put our capital dollars. And I expect this to continue and I expect to see things pickup.\nBrett Feldman: Alright, thank you.\nLowell McAdam: Brad, let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a couple of quick clarifications from Matt and one for Lowell. Matt, so just following up on that EPS guide to be clear, the low single-digit guidance does include the benefit from the change in the accounting for the handset related selling costs. And just to clarify that. And then the second on the cash flow guidance, the $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion cash flow benefit, is that a sequential year-over-year benefit or is that a benefit relative to what you're expecting to pay in cash taxes in 2018. And then Lowell, if I could just ask, you've done a number of things on fiber both organic builds in terms of Boston for instance, acquisitions of XO and then more creative partnerships like on the WOW front. Can you kind of talk a little about as we look into '18, '19, kind of the path forward on fiber infrastructure in supporting the 5G build. Is it more of an organic game plan from here on out or are they still on ways to make acquisitions on that front? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, David. So, your second question to me the cash flow guide, the $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion that is compared to what our 2018 cash taxes would have been without tax reform. So, it's not a comparison against 2017's cash taxes. It's just the 2018 impact with and without tax reform. On the EPS guide, maybe I'll try to say in this little clearer. The EPS guide is our view on the business without revenue recognition and without tax reform. So, then you lay on top of that number, the impact of revenue recognition that we gave in the AK last week and you also lay on top the $0.55 to $0.65 increase in EPS that I described in the prepared remarks earlier this morning. So, hopefully that does that help clear up the EPS question?\nDavid Barden: Sorry, Matt. Because the revenue recognition is one thing but there is an expense recognition change, that's a separate thing that's a benefit between $900 million and $1.2 billion.\nMatthew Ellis: Right.\nDavid Barden: And I was just wondering if that's included in the single-digit or not included in the single-digit?\nMatthew Ellis: It is not included in the single-digit, you add it on to the single-digit guidance.\nDavid Barden: Perfect, thank you.\nLowell McAdam: Okay. Then David, so your question kind of boils down to or is it organic or is it M&A and where do we see deploying fiber. So, just for everyone else on the call, we have done some M&A. XO had a fair amount of fiber and WideOpenWest had fiber that we did by M&A. But we also announced our deal with Corning, which is a multi-year deal where we're doing 12.5 million miles of fiber per year for the next three years. So, that would tell you we're sort of tilting toward organic. And our priorities are really what can we do to get off of others lease services to meet our 4G cell densification needs, then 5G, and then our enterprise customers. And we're out in markets now obviously placing fiber but it's a market-by-market analysis of the three factors that I just talked about. And frankly, the cities the meeting that we're having with the cities and what access they will give us to street furniture and conduit and those sorts of things factor into the equation. So, it's a bit fluid at this point and I wouldn\u2019t tell you that if an opportunity came up to accelerate it through M&A, we would do it, but most of the fiber companies were built for different purposes. They were point-to-point enterprise sort of services and they don\u2019t fit the architecture that we're building today which is multi-use fiber for Intelligent Edge Network. So, and I hope that's clear enough for you but certainly leaning toward organic builds to meet Verizon needs to drive our cost down in our performance up.\nDavid Barden: Thanks guys, I appreciate it.\nLowell McAdam: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, good morning. Question for Matt as well as a question for Lowell. First Matt, can you talk about the strength in wireless phone that adds in the fourth quarter in a bit more detail and can you also describe what you're seeing from two of the changes in the competitive over the past 12 months which is cable starting to sell wireless subscription and also some of your competitors bundling in video services. And Lowell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the vision at Verizon. As you look at what you're investing in the mobile business, fiber infrastructure, 5G, is there a broader vision inside the company that you want to provide broadband access to as many premises as well as mobile customers across the country? And is there some vision of what proportion of the country you may be able to reach in three to five years as you take all of these things together that you're dealing as a company? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Mike. So, I'll start off with the wireless front question and then Lowell can get onto fiber. Look, we had a great year on the wireless performance. The net ads were very strong as I mentioned, our smartphone net ads at 1.8 million for the year up 34% year-over-year. So, we really saw a significant change. Today we launched unlimited back in February of last year and from that point forward, we have competed very effectively in the marketplace and it really allow customers to have a similar currency to compare different carriers on and the value proposition is resonating. And despite all the noise that you hear from other people and the claims you hear from other people, the network quality matters. We saw that numerous times throughout the year and we see that in the performance we had on net ads whether it be the new activations coming in or the churn that we'd had. So, each of the last three quarters of the year, phone churn was below 0.8% and I think that tells you how much customers enjoy being on the Verizon network. So, you ask about the game of source. Look, we're happy of what we've seen so far. Obviously, Comcast is on and Charter has said they expect to be on later this year. And as we say consistently we like those agreements and we signed them in 2011 and we're happy to be doing them today. And we'll see how they play out but everything we've seen so far is in line with our expectations and we're glad to have that traffic on that network and monetize in that traffic based on what those companies are doing with those agreements. And in terms of what the competitors are doing. Look, they bundle a number of things into their services during the course of last year and our numbers have staid very consistent. So, at the end of the day, the quality of the network that the device is on is of fundamental importance. And overall, when you look at our value proposition, it continues to resonate strongly.\n.:\nLowell McAdam: Okay Mike, let me take where we want to have from infrastructure in a vision perspective. Look, I think it's very clear here whether you look at what's going on today with customers or what you're anticipating that you saw at CES and others from what's next that there is an insatiable demand for broadband. And it's not mobile and it's not fixed. It, customers don\u2019t care and I think who wins is going to be able to provide them the service that they can move seamlessly from fixed to mobile. We have been a much stronger mobile company over the years but the way we're positioning our fiber deployment and the way we're positioning 5G, we will be able to disregard geography and deploy those broadband services at a much lower cost than we've ever seen at least during my career. Now for us to complete the vision, you need to be able to provide sort of those internet information services and video drives an awful lot of that. And we talked at length about taking the Oath assets to be that information source around news boards, finance and entertainment and lifestyle. And we think that the assets that we have will provide what customers need. So, and you look at the applications going forward, they will whether it's medical and healthcare services, whether it's smart cities, whether it's education, whether it's autonomous cars and transportation systems, you're going to need that sort of seamless high bandwidth. And we lump that under the title human ability. So, our focus is around giving all of our customers the capabilities to embrace these applications, so the future that are going to make their lives so much better. And so our investments they are all about providing the assets in the platforms to deliver that.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, very much.\nLowell McAdam: Brad, let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, good morning. A question about your capital budgeting process in the light of tax reform. Just given that the returns on a whole range of projects will now have been boosted by both the lower tax rate and the accelerated depreciation. Does that change your priorities with respect to capital investment or are there some specific types of projects whether it's deploying fiber or that sort of thing that now pops in front of the queue as being meaningfully more attractive than they were. And how should we think about that with respect to the total size of your capital budget going forward?\nLowell McAdam: Well Craig, I'll take that and then Matt can jump in. I guess you could accuse us of being boring but you at least should give us credit for being consistent. We have been extremely disciplined and then when we see an opportunity, we go hard. And you saw that in 3G, you saw that in 4G and you're going to see it and you're seeing it in 5G in placing fiber. We see a real opportunity here. We were the ones that stood up and said two years ago when everybody said we are way too early but we've been deliberate about it. We've gone out, we've done the field trials, we've developed the ecosystem, we worked with partners from Korea as well as the infrastructure providers were out there as I said with 200 sale sites today learning and we're going to see what commercially happens in these three to five cities. Then we'll make the decision. So, to us it's a very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we're all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline. What tax reform does do is it gives us great flexibility that once we prove to ourselves that we can get a reasonable return on invested capital, we can accelerate very rapidly. And that gets the match point about we want to early on strengthen that balance sheet to give us the flexibility. But the strategies there and we are all sort of like a spring ready to expand very quickly if we need to. But we have to get through another couple of hurdles here before we make those decisions and we're not ready to say that in January of '18 but I certainly hope by fourth quarter results next year we're accelerating because we've got such a great story to tell.\nMatthew Ellis: The only other thing I'd add to that, Craig, and I'd kind of come back to the comments that Hans Vestberg made earlier this month that \"In our Industry, the nature of the way that we spend money, having significant increases and decreases is in a fashion the way we deploy CapEx.\" So, we're certainly looking at given as you say tax reform can change that some of the return math, but we'll be methodical about it. And there's a lot of planning that goes into our capital spending before we get to it. And so, that's why you see us making the comments we do. We certainly look forward having the right opportunities in front of us. But you will us do it methodically and do it in the way that creates the greatest value.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks.\nLowell McAdam: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJennifer Fritzsch: Okay. Thank you for taking the question. Two, if I may. One, the inevitable spectrum question. With T Mobile\u2019s purchases in the broadcast [auction] may have I think two times the amount of low band spectrum. Well, you have a kind of millimeter way spectrum, some may say or as might say as how the eggs are in that basket. How do you think of that? And then second if I could get some math around David's question earlier. You mentioned moving away from leases, can you quantify how much right now you're paying them back house to them about cyber providers same class?\nLowell McAdam: Why don\u2019t I take the spectrum question? As you say, Jennifer, \"the inevitable question.\" Look, there is going to be an awful lot of noise around deployment of 5G. If you recall back when we deployed 4G, there was a big scramble for everybody to try to get 3G to look like 4G and we called it 4G Faux. And you're seeing some of the same stuff right now. In order to do 5G and this is right out of the standard which we certainly agree with, you need at least a 100 megahertz of bandwidth to provide the latency, the reliability, the throughputs that really are the 5G promise. I can take 5G and I can put it on 10 megahertz of PCS if I want to. It won't perform like 5G, it will be the technology but it won't have the reliability, it won't have the throughput and it won't have the latency. So, you're going to get a lot of this, well they need this or they are depending on whether your selling spectrum or what you've got in your basket of spectrum today. But I wouldn\u2019t change positions with anybody out there. I've got plenty of low band spectrum that works great for 4G, it's going to serve us for years to come. But in order to put all of the aspects of 5G into play, you need 100s of megahertz of bandwidth. The only one who has that in a big way in the market place is us.\nMatthew Ellis: And so, I'll just add one other piece to that, I agree exact low set about 5G and you should think about 4G network. We've always said these three things. Spectrum is a densification in the architecture and then the technology. I can tell you over the past few months there's been a number of technology upgrades to the network and you will see in that in the network performance a number of those we deployed in the back end of the fourth quarter, so significant amount of additional capacity being added to the network as we head into '18, again without having to go acquire additional spectrum. But I do expect you to ask that question on those who's going forward. It would be a kind of a miss if people didn't. In terms of your question on how much we are paying back on fiber end, that's not a number we disclose. We really don't break out the income statement by individual line items, we're not going to start doing that now. But I would just say as we think about fiber, we look at the most economic way of getting it irrespective of where it shows up in the financial statements and we'll continue to do that.\nJennifer Fritzsch: Thank you.\nLowell McAdam: Hey Brad, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. You may ask your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thanks, very much. Late last year, Lowell, you had highlighted a goal for $10 billion in cost cuts over the next few years. I was wondering how should we think about the areas where you believe the biggest opportunities for cost reductions are and how should we think about those cost cuts filtering in through the company over the next couple of years? And then secondly, I was wondering if going back to the 5G topic, if you can touch upon whether you believe that fiber will be a competitive advantage in this world. Clearly you folks are making a significant amount of investment to get the necessary densification capillarity that you need for fiber. Others seemed to be working with cable providers to improve densification and back haul, do you believe that this is a viable alternative versus what you guys are doing or do you believe that at this point in time you are setting the stage for a longer term competitive mode as 5G comes to commercial positioning?\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Amir. Let me take the first one on the $10 billion number over the next four years that Lowell mentioned in September and we have talked about little since then. Look, what every area of the business is where we're looking and we believe that there is opportunities across every area of the business. Obviously network; cost are significant part, distribution; is something we're taking a close look at customer care or the back office type activities. Essentially there is no area of the business it isn't going to get examined as part of this exercise because this imperative we make sure that we're as efficient a company as we can be as we go forward. From a timing standpoint, I can tell you we've embedded the 2018 targets for this activity in each of the business units operating plans for the year. And I look forward to discussing the results that we achieved on this as we go forward in '18 and into the future.\nLowell McAdam: And then Amir, I guess my answer on the fiber competitive advantage is, throughout my career I have always believed and it's been reinforced many times that if you've got a critical component of your success, you better own it and control it. And that fits with our direct distribution, it fits with a lot of our customer service. We don't outsource sales. We certainly wouldn't outsource critical components of our network. As Hans has come in and put in our architecture for Intelligent Edge, owning that fiber asset is important to our financial performance as well as the performance of the network. And as we've seen time-and-time again, network competitive advantage drives customers which ultimately drives financial. So, you won't see us outsource much in the way of network unless someone has a huge scale advantage and we could negotiate very strong performance and very consistent financials that would go along with it.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much for the incremental color.\nBrady Connor: That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back over to Lowell for some closing comments.\nLowell McAdam: Thanks, Brady. So just a couple of final points from me. I don't come on these calls very often. I like to save that for when we've got significant changes in the business. And obviously, tax reform and our use of those funds was important for us to clarify. But there was a second reason for me to come on and I have been in this industry for 30 years and I think we're breaking into one of the most exciting times that I've seen in my career. We are on the cusp of what I call the fourth industrial revolution as we see smart city applications, the changes in medical, the changes in transportation and education; all of those are fueled by a strong telecommunications infrastructure. So, I think this is a great time for our industry overall. Obviously, I think Verizon is the best positioned to deliver that future. We've had a long history of strong operational and financial performance. We're investing in the media platforms and the fiber assets and the network and in the new technologies to meet the needs that are coming forward. And I think as I said that will be a major change in the way people live, work and play. So, I am very excited about 2018, what lies ahead for us. I look forward to sharing the results and the successes as we move forward in this year and coming on a call next year at this time and recapping one of the best years in our history. So, with that we'll close the call and we appreciate all of your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using Verizon conference services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brady Connor, who will be assuming my role as the Head of Investor Relations later in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Matt goes through the results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of about $620 million, primarily associated with early debt redemption costs of $454 million and acquisition and integration related charges of $166 million retaining to Yahoo and other acquisitions. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $374 million, or $0.09 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.98 in the third quarter, compared to $1.01 a year ago. Included in our EPS is a $0.01 impact due to the natural disasters in Texas and Florida during the quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. Let me by start by reviewing the progress on our strategic initiatives before getting into detailed results. The cornerstone of our strategy is to provide our customers with the best network experience available. We are steadily investing to advance our 4G LTE leadership and actively building the network of the future. Our network performance leadership was evidenced by a sweep of third-party surveys for the first half of 2017 and a network's resiliency during the recent hurricanes and wildfires. We delivered solid operational and financial performance in a competitive environment. We grew our retail postpaid and prepaid wireless bases with new unlimited data options and maintain strong customer retention. Service revenue trajectory also improved as expected. Our wireline results were consistent with the past quarters despite ongoing consumer video headwinds throughout the industry. Demand for a high quality fiber based products remains strong. Our Oath team's integration of AOL and Yahoo is ahead of our internal expectation. We are confident in the execution of our strategy to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows and produce long-term value for our shareholders. The board of directors demonstrated our commitment to return value to our shareholders when they declared the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase last month. We will start by reviewing the third quarter segment operation performance, followed by a progress update on our new businesses, a walkthrough of consolidated results and finally network and technology updates. Now onto the wireless segment on Slide 5. Our wireless business delivered another strong quarter of operational performance in a highly competitive environment. We grew and retained high value postpaid customer relationships profitably. In August, we expanded our postpaid unlimited data plan to include a lower price access entry points, which provides consumers with more choices to experience the leading 4G LTE network with confidence in our networks we are now addressing a larger market with Unlimited. Given our clear and comparable service value proposition, momentum continued in the quarter. Smartphone net adds were 486,000 versus 242,000 last year. Total postpaid net additions were 603,000 included [four] (Ph) net adds of 274,000, 91,000 tablets and 238,000 other connected devices led by wearables. We added 30,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 107,000 last year. Total retail postpaid churn was 0.97% for the third quarter which improved by seven basis points year-over-year. postpaid's phone churn was 0.75% and was the main driver of the improvement in total postpaid churn. Postpaid device activations were nearly 9.8 million of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rates was 5.5%. During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid net adds were 139,000 for the quarter with an increased focus on the smartphone value proposition. Additionally, we have recently expanded our offering to allow families the flexibility to combine different prepaid plans at a great value. Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 2.4% in third quarter as compared to a 3.9% decline a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, service revenue declined 5.1% versus a 6.7% decrease in the previous quarter. sequentially service revenue increased for the first time in 12 quarters. The key drivers of overall improvement in service revenue include increased access revenue through customer migration to higher access points. New account formation and the tail end of the transition of customers to unsubsidized pricing. We now have approximately 78% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans as compared to 60% a year ago. We expect the service revenue trends to continue to improve in the fourth quarter and to exit the year with a decline of less than 4% year-over-year. In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 5.5% due to a higher device payment plan take rate. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, which is consistent with the prior period. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth third quarter to increase seasonally due to heightened consumer equipment activity. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter. Wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.2%, up slightly sequentially and up from 44.9% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, we expect the improvement in service revenue to flow through wireless EBITDA margin partially offsetting pressures in highest seasonal volume, advertising expenses and promotional activity. Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment on Slide 7. Total reported wireline revenue grew 1.1% including XO operations and data center divestitures. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.7%, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Our fiber offerings continue to gain share and grow revenue partially offset in a decline in legacy copper products. Consumer markets revenue increased 0.9% driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue grew 4.6% including the impacted two markey Pay Per View events during the quarter. Verizon was recognized by a leading third-party study as the top rated residential internet provider for customer satisfaction in the Fios footprint. Fios Gigabit Connection, which launched earlier this year continues to gain traction offers symmetrical speed of up to one gigabit per second. We added 66,000 Fios Internet Customers in the quarter. Fios Video results were pressured due to the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 18,000 in the quarter. Enterprise Solutions revenue excluding XO, decreased 5.0%, while growth in fiber based products continues. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 5.3%. Partner Solutions revenue declined 3.9% on an organic basis, which is an improvement over prior period. Within business markets, fiber revenue is increasing, driven by demand for Fios broadband products. On an organic basis, total revenue declined 5.8% year-over-year. On a comparable basis, the third quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 21.1%, compared to 20.3% a year ago and up 40 basis points sequentially driven by ongoing costs control measures. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 8 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. During the quarter, our Oath team has been executing on more than 20 integration work streams. We are positioning the business for the future, locking in early synergies and setting out a roadmap for the next several years with the expectations to realize $1 billion in operating expense synergies through 2020. With the addition of Oath, Verizon's addressable market has expanded from millions of wireless and wireline customers to about one billion global content consumers. We are combining the best aspects of AOL and Yahoo to create a uniform and integrated platform to drive engagement and consumer value. Oath revenue is $2 billion for the quarter, we will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters as we progress through the integration phase. Telematics revenue was over $220 million in the quarter including Fleetmatics and Telogis. Total IoT revenue on an organic basis increased approximately 13% in the quarter. Let's move next to Slide 9 to wrap up with our consolidated results for the quarter. The solid segment results in the quarter and addition of new businesses drove improvements in the consolidated top-line reported results. In the third quarter, total operating revenues were higher by 2.5% on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, excluding divestures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined to 2.3%. Similar to recent quarters, the primary driver was the year-over-year decrease in wireless service revenue. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margins was 36.7% up slightly from prior year's margin of 36.5%. We are focused on driving profitability through cost and capital efficiencies across our business. As Lowell announced in September, we have targeted $10 billion in cumulative cash savings over the next four years. Let's turn now to cash flows in the balance sheet on the Slide 10. We had a strong quarter of cash generation supporting our consistent capital allocation program and returning value to shareholders. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $17.2 billion including working capital pressure primarily due to the $3.7 billion of device payment plan receivables. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $11.3 billion with the sequential with a sequential increases in the quarter driven by increased spending in wireless, supporting growing network demand, while prepositioning for 5G. We expect full-year 2017 capital expenditures to be at the lower end of the guided range of $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion. Free cash flow from the first nine months of the year totaled $5.9 billion, which included a net after tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset backed securitization which we initiated in the third quarter of last year. we did not executing an asset back securitization during the third quarter, but have generated $2.9 billion year-to-date from our ABS borrowings. Over the last few days, we completed our third public ABS transaction this year to $1.4 billion. The impact of device payment plans and on balance sheet securitization is expected to approach a steady state by year-end, reducing working capital headwinds during 2018. We anticipate working capital fluctuations throughout the year due to seasonality in wireless equipment volumes. We ended the quarter with the $117.5 billion of total debt, comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Our near term unsecured maturities are modest at $2.3 billion through 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 11 to discuss our network and technology. Our industry leading wireless and wireline networks are the cornerstone of our strategy and we consistently invest to ensure that we have capacity to serve growing demand technology to reduce the cost of serve and a network position to lead the industry into the future. We continue to win awards in third-party studies, a test to combination of coverage, speed and reliability. Based on the confidence in our network, we broaden to unlimited options to offer more customers and unmatched unlimited experience on the best wireless network. As expected, the introduction of unlimited pricing plans has increased the LTE network usage across various busy timeframes and geographies as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day. We are more affectively utilizing existing network capabilities and service plan features to handle the increased traffic without interrupt in the quality of the customer experience. Just over 50% of our available low and mid-band spectrum portfolio is being used 4G LTE. Network reliability and resiliency are critical elements to our wireless network, we are thankful and proud of the work performed by our employees during the tragic natural disasters in Texas, Florida and Northern California, who ensured they are first responder and all of those effect who were able to relay on our network in the time of need. We maintained a high level of performance through our planning, network redundancy and rapid response despite wide spread power outages. Although, we are not a wireless network operate in Puerto Rico, we have offered assistance to the local carriers and government officials as they work to recover from unprecedented hurricane damage. We are steadily investing in the network of the future, which we called a Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. This network has many components the lead to a multi-use software driven network upscale. It goes from the wireless or wireline access networks to intelligent distributed computing platform to a highly automated software enabled core network. This architecture enable by a dense flexible radio network with deep multi-used fiber that we have been building for years. As we seen new use cases, this Intelligent Edge Network architecture will meet the new types of application demand. We will leverage these in [HART] (Ph) network capability such as latency, throughput and security to create network slices that will be tuned to the specific needs of each application. Our pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless broadband trials are continuing, live customer experiences on the network provide key data and learnings that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments. We are on-track to share trial results later in the fourth quarter. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G industry standards and the ecosystems are fixed in mobile. Global development is accelerating based on our work alongside industry partners for multiple used cases. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy to drive future growth while delivering near-term results. We are laying the foundation for the network of the future, while maintaining a strong lead in 4G LTE coverage, capacity and reliability. Our focus is on preserving and growing our customer relationships, while expanding our presence in digital media and Telematics. The execution model is to deliver strong fundamental results, allocate capital to our networks, maintain a strong balance sheet and return value to our shareholders. Our wireless value proposition is evolved to allow more customers to experience unlimited wireless plans on the best U.S. networks. We produce solid operational and financial performance across the business in a competitive environment while investing in our best-in-class networks and driving near-term cost efficiencies. Our long-term strategy is to change people's lives by delivering the promise of the digital world while leading the industry and innovate for future technological application. 5G provides a path for growth with fixed and mobility use cases with 4G interoperability. The 5G ecosystem is progressing with [standards] (Ph) and technology development and we are prepositioning our network with fiber investments, spectrum resources and cloud architecture. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so that we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you Matt. Eunice, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Good morning. Matt, you mentioned the $10 billion cost reduction program. Could you just give us a little bit more color around some of the buckets on that and how should that layer through the next four years. and then on Unlimited, any updated stats on what percent of your base or what percent of your new customers are taking that plan and obviously since you changed it to the two or the three plans who's taking the lower rate plan versus the higher is that splitting more towards the higher ARPU plans. Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks Simon and good morning. So on your first question around the $10 billion books, Lowell announced that last month, since then we have put a dedicated team against that and we are starting to get around that work. It's a little early to get into some of the specifics of the timing of when you should see that, but in terms of bucket that's going to come across. Really think about all of the all parts of the business are in focus here, whether that\u2019s the network, whether that be distribution and care and even to obviously the shared service parts of our business and across the complete supply chain. We are going to take a deep look across the whole business and identify areas where we have the opportunities to significantly improve the efficiency on how we operate the business. As we get further into that program, we will share more specifics overtime both on where the savings are going to be realized from and also the expected timing, but I think we are off to a good start with it. In terms of your second question around Unlimited and the new price plans. I would tell you that between Unlimited and the Verizon 2.0 that we introduced last summer, we now have approximately two-thirds of the base on planned where they could control their over expense. And so that's up as you would expected from where we were a quarter ago and that's obviously a significant part of the base now has the ability to do that. The mix is as expected between the two plans, we are not going to go into the specifics of each of those. I would tell you though that in the third quarter what was - we saw as we expected the migration of existing customers from data bucket plans to Unlimited plans shifted to where on average they were stepping up in revenue from their bill prior. And as we expected, we knew that initially we would see optimizes who had the opportunity to move to Unlimited and save money, we saw that in this first quarter as we introduced those plans. In the second quarter, we continue to move through that by the end of the quarter essentially that was flat that customer\u2019s migrated over. And then in the third quarter, we got to the point where the customers migrating over actually increasing and you saw the increase in [indiscernible] sequentially from 2Q to 3Q for the first time in three years. So we are seeing good progress there.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Just one quick follow-up. Any impact then on 2018 or is it really going to be ramping through 2018, so the impact is more 2019, 2020 from the 10 billion.\nMatthew Ellis: You will see some impact in 2018, but it\u2019s a cumulative number over those four years, but absolutely, we will see benefit in 2018.\nMichael Stefanski: Simon, thank you. Next question Eunice.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Matt, couple of questions on the wireless sort of the growth and profitability. First on the upgrade, saw a low number in the third quarter. As you guys look after the fourth quarter do you think that changes and maybe bounces back a little bit, like maybe won\u2019t see as much seasonality you typically do, we are basically trying to get a sense whether it\u2019s sort of a lack change in the technology or just customer at this point waiting for their turn to come out? And then related to Simon\u2019s questions, you saw sequential growth in service revenue for the first time in a while this quarter and it sounds like these trends are sort of inflecting. So could you guys return to sort of year-over-year growth sooner than the third quarter next year given those underlying trend you are seeing in ARPU? And related to your comments about margins, does that mean that we might not see the typical downdraft in margins, we typically do in the fourth quarter given the flow through effects that you mentioned?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, thanks John. So as you mentioned the upgrade rate in the third quarter was a little lower than we have seen in past years. I think what you are seeing there is difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we have historically seen. Obviously Apple is part of that with splitting the new devices between the eight, which came out in 3Q and the ten which comes out in 4Q. But also on the Android OS side of the house with having the new Google device coming out this month as well. I think you are going to see more of \u2013 we would expect to see a shift is some of the volumes versus typically from 3Q to 4Q. So look as we get into the holiday season some of those new devices come out, we think, we will see strong demand and look if you are paying a $1000 for a new handset you are going to walk not to be on a good network. So we are very confident that we will get more than our fair share of that activity when it comes through in the fourth quarter, but obviously, we will wait to see exactly how that plays out. In terms of the sequential revenue trends and as you highlighted, we were up in service revenue from 2Q to 3Q. That was in-line with our expectations as we discussed on the last call. As you start to see combination a number of factors. We have largely migrated the consumer base to unsubsidized pricing, it was 78% in 3Q, 75% in 2Q. So that transition is largely done and so you are no longer seeing as much of a headwind from the reduction in the line access fee. And as I mentioned, we are starting to see step up and migrate is over. In addition to that, we increased the number of accounts for the second quarter in a row, so you got the total volume in the business up as the rate we are getting from customers going up too. So as I said in the script, we expect to be inside of 4% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, and as I have said previously, I expect that we will get to service revenue growth during 2018. In terms of your questions around margins, it's a little too soon to say where they will play out in the fourth quarter. Obviously as we are now on unsubsidized, we don't have the same subsidy headwind, but we will see what the environment is like in the fourth quarter competitively and we will respond as necessary. So we will see where that shakes out between now and the end of the year.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks Matt.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks John. Eunice, next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you can maybe unpack the improvement you continue to see in postpaid churn, particularly phone churn. You obviously have a much better visibility into your customer base and than we do. So for example, to what extend do you think that this is a structural improvement in churn as a result of customers moving into Unlimited plans and other plans where they can control their overage. To what extent do you think it might just be that the seasonal pattern of device launches has been moved a bit and so it could see it moved back to prior levels as we go through that cycle. And then just as an extension of this question of this question. Some of your competitors have been looking to lower churn by including free or just deeply discounted streaming video products as part of their bundles. I'm curious whether that's something that you think would make sense for Verizon as well. Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks Brett. Look I would say as I look at the churn number, we have always had a good churn number, it's obviously 0.75 continues to trend that we saw in the second quarter and really continues the trend since we saw mid February when we launched Unlimited. And as we said at the time, the key driver of launching Unlimited was to protect our pace of customer which we think is the best and most valuable set of customers in the industry. So look there is a number of things that go into that, but I would tell one of the biggest thesis is the network experience that Verizon customers have, they get to see that they understand the reality of our network experience versus some of the others and so we saw that with some of the recent natural disasters that customers on our network understands that when things really matter Verizon is a network they want to be on. So that continues to be key part of it and I believe we can continue to have very good churn without necessarily the bundle in other aspect into the core offering.\nBrett Feldman: Is it fair to say that you would expect on a seasonal basis going forward. So for example, this fourth quarter you still think you might do better than you did a year ago even if there is an uptick in devices and maybe industry wide churn.\nMatthew Ellis: You mean to better year-over-year [indiscernible] number?\nBrett Feldman: Yes.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, I think look we have seen that since we launched Unlimited and we had a clear and comparable offer in the marketplace. We have demonstrated that our customers prefer being on Verizon rather than moving somewhere else and I have no reason to believe that will change in the fourth quarter as we go forward. So very confident that we will see that trend continue.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks Brett. Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess just a couple. First, Matt, you kind of highlighted the impact of divestitures and acquisitions on the revenue line which was about a 5% swing versus the reported numbers. Could you maybe walk that down through EBITDA and then to earnings with respect to all the different moving parts year-over-year? And then second, Lowell was pretty widely reported as talking about working on a content type of program or partnership or acquisition as you worked into the back part of the year. Could you elaborate a little bit more on kind of what the goal is for that project and maybe how it ties to your plans for launching your own over-the-top video products? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, so I will start with the second one there. So with respect to Lowell\u2019s comment around content and potential deal for usage rights. I would say, we are continuing to work that particular transaction Lowell, when he made that common expected it would be done by now. Unfortunately it just taken a little longer to [indiscernible] fully expect to see something there as we move forward. In terms of the over the top, really nothing new to add versus what Lowell said last month. Look this is a space what we think there is an opportunity for us to play, we think that makes sense for us to play in that space, but we don\u2019t want to launch just a me too type product. So we are continuing to look at what makes sense for us to launch something that\u2019s differentiated in that space, probably around live programming, but how and when we launch something will be TBD. In terms of the, your questions around the M&A side. Obviously the revenue line, we brought Yahoo and you brought XO and those brought revenue on day one, when you close a transactions or same thing with the Telematics businesses as we closed in the back half of last year, but initially especially the Telematics businesses and Yahoo not significant. The EBITDA or EPS line maybe a little bit of pressure, the EPS line if anything about $0.04 on a year-to-date basis. And then they also bring depreciation and amortization, which is why there may not a huge amount of pressure at the EBITDA line, but as you move down the income statements of operating income and EPS, we see a little pressure this year. As we expand those businesses going forward we expect them to contribute in the future.\nDavid Barden: Great. Okay, thanks.\nMichael Stefanski: Eunice, next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins: Well thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the three to five year view for wireless. Can you just help us understand the Verizon\u2019s expectations with the investments you are making, the technology that you are deploying? How investor should think about top-line growth over a more extended period of time? And then secondly, if you could delve into a little bit more detail on some of the businesses you have acquired in over the last couple of years. In terms of Oath and Telamatics and how should investors think about the growth of those businesses over the next couple of years as well on the top-line especially? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, thanks Mike. So look, as you think about the while this business going forward and obviously I\u2019m going to talk specifically about our views on 2018 and so on. We will have those discussions when we get to January. But you think of the business overall, we are very confident with where seeing the growth start to migrate to we talked about the trends in service revenue, the fact that we should expect those to get back to positive during 2018 once we have worked through the transition fully from subsidized to unsubsidized pricing. We think it will continue from there, we will continue to add net adds to the business based of the quality of the network. And then the network will continue to expand the capabilities as we transition to 5G and we think that will give us other opportunities to expand the wireless business going forward. So we are very confident in the future trajectory of the business there and obviously as we think about three to five year view, the overall GDP is going to play into that. But as I think about 5G and what it\u2019s going to do for the business going forward, and then as I think about the new businesses coming in, and contributing as we expand those and then continuing to work on the cost side of the business as Lowell described last month. I don't think that you're going to recognize the business five years from now versus where it is today.\nMichael Rollins: If I could just follow-up on that point, the wireline business is something where you upgraded significant amount to fiber, but you also have some copper, you're competing for a full - bundle in a lot of your market, but you're smaller relative to some of your video competitors. Have you thought about doing something different in the wireline business in terms of the way the footprint will look, whether it's through 5G or other investments in the wireline business or other strategic options for that assets.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, so there is a lot in that question Mike. So look fundamentally as you think about the wireline business you're thinking about really two assets there, you have got the legacy copper business which continues to have a secular declines across our set of customers, whether that the consumer, enterprise, small business whatever. And then you have the fiber side of that business where we see continued growth and demand. And that's just not within the [indiscernible] footprint, its more international sales. So if you think around we have had the Ultra-Long-Haul backbone for a number of years now, earlier this year we expanded that with the XO acquisition which added fiber metro rings in the 45 of the top 50 markets. We obviously have significant fiber in the Northeast corridors, we have been building Fios over the last 10 years. So you should expect to see the fiber side of the wireline business continue to grow and become more relevant and then as part of that you have got the convergence of the network between the fiber network and the wireless network as we [indiscernible] 4G and preposition for 5G. So as we go forward here we think that the combination of those networks is incredibly important.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nMichael Stefanski: Mike thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thanks. First Mike, I just wanted to say congratulations on a terrific career in IR and thank you on perhaps all the help you have given us and Brady congratulations on your new position as well. I wanted to ask about consolidation, because it's obviously the top - and from what Sprint and T Mobile has said, we could see an announcement as early as next week. Can you talk about how you think a Sprint, T Mobile merger will change the competitive landscape and would you argue to the SEC and [indiscernible] in favor of approving a transaction like that?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes Craig, look I would tell you, there is a lot of various rumors and so on around the industry overtime around various M&A activity and I\u2019m not going to comment on other people\u2019s businesses. I would tell you, we have the right set of assets to compete irrespective of the industry structure and that\u2019s what we are focused on and I\u2019m very confident in our ability to be successful however things play out with other people?\nCraig Moffett: Thanks. Could I ask, since there\u2019s not much to say on that topic, one separate question then? Could you update us on the 5G fixed wireless broadband trials, what you are seeing and how that informs your expectations for what you are going to do in 2018?\nMatthew Ellis: Absolutely. So we will have more specifics on that later in the quarter and we will get the right folks talking about that. But I can say the trials are going very well and we are getting a lot of good experience using the millimeter wave spectrum and some other things we are seeing whether it\u2019s a fact that we can deliver service without needing line of sight, whether it\u2019s think about MDUs and the number of floors we can deliver service to being more than we expected. We have experienced delivering service in MDUs above 20 floors, which is more than we thought it would be going into the trial. So a number of good things coming out of the trials, we will get back to all of you later in the quarter with more specific details on the results of the trials and what that means for 2018, but nothing has change about our intent to launch the fixed wireless broadband offering during the course of 2018.\nCraig Moffett: Okay, bye guys.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you. Next question please Eunice?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael McCormack: Hey guys thanks. Matt, in the prepared remarks, you talked about over-the-top and some of the video pressure that we have all been hearing about a lot more recently. How do you guys look at that? When you look at the customers leaving you, is it leaving just the video piece of it and maintaining the broadband connection or are you just seeing a shift to different providers generally? And then secondly, the spread between those making device payments in wireless versus those that are on unsubsidized plans, how many of those in your best estimate are people that actually were making a payment plan to you guys, pay off the phone and are opting into sort of a lower price point instead of upgrading the phone?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, thanks Mike. So look on your first question. There is really nothing new here to us in terms of the trends we have been seeing over the past few years around whether it\u2019s cord-cutting or [cord-nevers] (Ph) or whatever else. In fact, we have spoken in the past two or three years ago, we really started to speaking about this and the fact we said the traditional linear TV bundle is not long-term sustainable and you saw our reaction to that when we launched some of the different plans that we launched at that point in time. But so, we are not surprised by what we are seeing around the TV, but I would tell you what is important, when you move to over-the-top for your video entertainment, the quality of that broadband connection becomes more important than ever and if you want a quality broadband connection Fios and fiber to the home connection is the best option out there. And we continue to see strong numbers on the broadband side of the business as a result of that and we are very confident that the Fios Internet offering will continue to be very strong in the marketplace. As I think about the spread between the unsubsidized and the subsidized payments. Look, what you have here is you do have customers who were on subsidized pricing, get to the end of two-year contract and they then move to unsubsidized pricing and not necessarily getting there through upgrading to a new device and do a net on device payment plan. But that migration as we say is largely completely now have 78% of the base which meets virtually all of the consumer bases now on unsubsidized pricing. So as we go forward here the gap between the this year and the last year number will get narrower and narrower. And that's what is going to help drive the service revenue trajectory improvement as we go forward here.\nMichael McCormack: And Matt I'm sorry just quickly on the hurricane issue, you guys called out the one penny impact. But anything with respect to volumes in wireless that may have been even better as the hurricanes might have?\nMatthew Ellis: Certainly we had in both Huston and Florida, we have period of times when our stores were closed and certainly that\u2019s an impact. But we also saw good volumes as soon as those stores reopened, customer realizing in times like that you want to be on the best network and so we saw an uptick as soon as those stores reopened. And I have to get credit to our teams, whether it be on the network side and all the things they did and also our teams in the distribution side of the business, getting those stores open incredibly quickly after those storms, they did a fantastic job.\nMichael McCormack: Great. and congratulations Mike and Brady.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you Mike. Eunice Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nJennifer Fritzsch: Great, thank you for taking the question. Matt if I may, I just wanted to ask on fiber we have all been brought up to be believe fiber is really expensive to deploy. And yet we see you coming into the lower end of your CapEx range. I'm not asking you for guidance on 2018, but are you seeing some savings with these XO properties. Are you deploying those laterals yet, or is that going to be more kind of a 2018 event? And then if I also just could ask on the other element of 5G spectrum. I think [indiscernible] you feel comfortable with spectrum might that not even sit in the spectrum auction. Can you talk a little bit of how you as you look at your inventory are you feeling comfortable still with what you have? thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, so I'll answer the spectrum question first. We believe that we have a great portfolio of spectrum. As you look at the 4G network only approximately 50% just over 50% of our spectrum portfolio server in that network today. We have got additional spectrum assets that will serve that network in 2018 whether that the [Refarm] (Ph) and 850 and PCS or whether it would be put in the AWS-3 to work. And additionally as you move into the 5G world, we look forward to closing the straight path transactions and the XO spectrum transaction as head into 2018. So we are comfortable with our spectrum positions. As we think about future auctions we will wait to see what is in there or make assessments at that time. but very comfortable with the portfolio we have today. And as obviously as we think about added capacity to the network we have more than spectrum as the tools available to us as we go forward, and we have talked about the different technology and architecture tools with LTE Advance and all the different pieces in there. We continue to be able to add capacity as we move to more software defined networking and those type of tools and in obviously densification. And that densification based of having more fiber available in the network. So to get to your first question, we continue to deploy fiber and we will continue to do that as we head into 2018 as you say I'm not going to talk to 2018 CapEx at this time, but you should expect to see us continue to be deploying fiber around the country as we go forward to service both wireless but also customers across the rest of our businesses and getting into IoT applications as well.\nMichael Stefanski: Jennifer thank you and Eunice next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thanks very much. I was wondering if I could build upon the prior questions around your spending trajectory. If we think about this lower-end CapEx target for the year, how should we consider the outlook against that backdrop of investment? Clearly, focusing on network quality is a clear focus for you folks. I\u2019m just trying to unpack the commentary a touch, whether it\u2019s a shift in some of the spending priorities that\u2019s taking place that\u2019s enabling you to get to the lower end? Are we seeing inflection with the benefits from software-defined networks flowing through the business at this point? Or anything to that effect, Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, good question, thank you Amir. So as I think about the CapEx for the year and where it\u2019s coming in towards the lower end of the range. That\u2019s still going to be around 17 billion of spend, so certainly not in significant number. Some of this is just a timing of the activity with the network teams between 2017 and 2018l. But look, I would tell you that the key thing here and you talk about has there been any shift in priorities and I would say absolutely not. The priority to continue to invest in the network whether that\u2019s adding capacity for the networks today or pre-positioning the network and being at the leading edge of building the future network technologies, that priority is unchanged and as we had into 2018, you will see that we will continue to spend to continue to do exactly those things. So no major change there, as we head into 2018, more spending on fiber as we pre-position for 5G and continue to make sure we have the leading network.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thanks a lot, and one follow-up, if I may. In touching upon that 5G commentary, in recent weeks, we have seen some notable developments around the broader ecosystem, in particular the announcement with Qualcomm to accelerate the global 5G standard in millimeter wave spectrum. It seems like mobile 5G, in terms of its availability, is now being pulled forward. Is that going to affect the type of services that you plan to offer? Could we see mobile 5G a bit earlier than anticipated here? Any color to that effect would be great.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So I think we were very proud to be part of that announcement with Qualcomm earlier this week and really what you are seeing there is as we have talked about now for the past two to three years. We said if we put our shoulder behind 5G development. We think, we can accelerate versus some of the timing of safety place. And in fact, there were some people who were saying they didn\u2019t even think 5G was going to be real and if you be able to use millimeter wave spectrum. So we have demonstrated that by our effort so far, we have brought the ecosystem together, we have push forward the timing of standards coming forward and not surprised by any of that at all. It\u2019s exact as we expected. In terms of the timing of mobile 5G, it\u2019s certainly not a 2018 activity. But you talk about does it change our view on the types of services we will be able to offer, absolutely not. We have seen a wide range of services that we will be able to offer on 5G has - why we have been so excited about it, quite frankly and while we put our shoulder behind get in the ecosystem to move faster on this than they otherwise would have been and we look forward to being in position to offer those services in the years ahead.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thanks very much for the input.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you and Eunice we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks guys. And just upon the CapEx again. Matt are you seeing any benefits from kind of the [SDN] (Ph) in terms of pricing of equipment. And can you just talk about as you move to 5G. should we think about CapEx stepping up a couple of billion dollars a year? there is a lot of articles in the press over the last couple years that it might talk close to $20 billion $50 billion to build out a nationwide 5G network. Any color around that would be great.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes so thanks Tim. So in terms of benefits from SDN and so on, let me show as you not just SDN but also network function, virtualization it does allow the value of some of the hardware you put in the network to change overtime, and how you operate network moves more to the underlying software there. So I think we will see those trends as we continue to expand the network. In terms of deployment of 5G, I think some of the people who are estimating those numbers are getting ahead of themselves and it\u2019s just too early to tell. So as we have more visibility into the timing of spend around 5G we will share that with you, but it's way too early at this point and I'm not going to comment on those estimates.\nTimothy Horan: And then just lastly on the $10 billion of expense reduction. How much of that do you think you'll reinvest and maybe growth in the business. I guess how should we would be think about the longer term margin trend over the three to five year period?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, so as you think about the money, really wants to be generate those savings it becomes part of the overall pull. But I'm excited about the opportunities that the teams are developing to grow the business going forward and it's important that we make sure that we have the resources in the business to invest in those things. and we can't be investing in those things if we have inefficiencies in the core business to that point in time. So we just think it's a responsible thing to do to make sure that we constantly look at the efficiency of the business and look forward to generating those savings and discussing that more with you in the future.\nMichael Stefanski: Tim, thank you and before we end the call I would like turn it back to Matt for a few closing comments.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks Mike. I would like to close the call with the few key points. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry into the next generation of technology with our strong network of assets. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and to generate long-term shareholder value. Finally before I close the call today, I want to personally thank Mike for this commitment and the support he has given to me and many others throughout his career of Verizon. And we wish him all the best in the future. We will also like to welcome Brady Connor to the IR team. I have known Brady for several years and he will be a great successor to Mike in addition to the IR team. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for participation and for using Verizon conference services.

Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Thanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Matt goes through the results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $1.07 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax gain of about $1.8 billion. This net gain consists primarily of the sale of certain data centers to Equinix. We also incurred pre-tax severance charges of $607 million and acquisition and integrated related charges of $152 million, primarily in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets, which we previously disclosed. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $458 million, or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.96 in the second quarter, compared to $0.94 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's adjusted earnings per share included $0.07 from the impact of the work stoppage. Also, our consolidated results for the second quarter included one month of data center operations that we sold to Equinix on May 1, 2017, and about two weeks of Yahoo operations. We have posted unaudited historical wireline segment results, which recast the segment for the impact of the sale to Equinix on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter of execution. First, we invested in our 4G network leadership position, resulting in a sweep of third-party network performance surveys for the first half of 2017, while prepositioning for 5G services. Second, we delivered solid wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment with an increase in both postpaid and prepaid accounts. Third, we successfully completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets to scale our media business. Network leadership is the central element of our strategy, and we are continually investing in our network to extend our leadership in 4G capacity growth with densification using small cells, which includes expanding our fiber capabilities. As we prepare for the network of the future, we announced the acquisition of Straight Path for $3.1 billion, which we expect will close by the end of first quarter 2018. Straight Path complements our spectrum portfolio and positions us to lead and further drive 5G technology and its ecosystem. We have begun the precommercial fixed wireless trials in eight out of the 11 markets and have our first batch of customers on this technology. As we have previously highlighted, we will have trial results later in the year, and I look forward to sharing them with you. We had a strong quarter, adding and retaining wireless customers as the momentum from the launch of our unlimited plans was sustained throughout the quarter. We delivered a strong wireless operational performance that reflects customer demand for our high-quality network in a highly competitive market. Finally, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and immediately began executing on integration plans that we've been working on for over a year. We are confident in the execution of our strategy, which we expect to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows, and return long-term value to our shareholders. Let's go deeper into the second quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by wireless and wireline results, media and telematics progress, and network and technology updates. Now on to slide 6. In the second quarter, total operating revenue was in line with last year. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined 2.0%. The primary driver was the decrease in wireless service revenue, which was consistent with our expectation. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%. We remain focused on improving our overall cost structure through operating efficiencies across network, distribution, and care. As we shift more transactions toward a digital model, we can improve the customer experience and further enhance operating efficiencies. Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 7. Our operating segments continue to generate substantial cash flows. During the first half of 2017, cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.9 billion and included a net after-tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion. Our high-quality cash generation is driven by the diverse base of wireless and wireline customers. Our ongoing asset-backed securitization program provided $2.9 billion of cash, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The impact of the transition to device payment plans and on-balance-sheet securitization should approach a steady state around the end of 2017. Thereafter, the sequential impacts will primarily reflect seasonality of new device launches. As a result, we expect the working capital headwind to subside in 2018. For the first half of the year, capital spending was $7.0 billion, which was in line with last year. On a year-to-date basis, our reported free cash flow of $2.9 billion includes the discretionary pension contribution net of tax of $2.1 billion, which flowed through our cash flow from operations. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset-backed securitization, which was introduced in the third quarter of last year. Our balance sheet is solid and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $117.5 billion of total debt, which comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on-balance-sheet securitizations. We have not changed our capital allocation plan or our expectation for cash availability, and we remain focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders. Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide 8. In a highly competitive wireless environment, we delivered a strong operational performance, protecting and expanding our high-valued postpaid customer relationships while balancing profitability. With a clear and comparable offer, our value proposition highlighted the strength of our network, resulting in industry-leading customer retention and improved new demand during the quarter as our offer appealed to customers in underpenetrated segments. Wireless operational performance was sustained throughout the second quarter, building on the customer momentum at the end of the first quarter with improvements in both sequential and year-over-year net phone add performance. Net phone additions were 358,000, compared to 86,000 in the prior year. Smartphone net additions were 590,000, versus 336,000 last year. Postpaid net adds totaled 614,000, including tablet net adds of 2,000 and other connected devices of 254,000, led by Verizon Wireless retail home devices. We added 64,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 83,000 last year, and we grew our postpaid account base for the first time in the past six quarters. Our postpaid phone churn reflects customer demand for network quality and reliability, while pricing provided choices to meet customer needs. Postpaid phone churn not only continued recent trends below 0.9% but also established a new low in the LTE era at 0.70%. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.94% was consistent year over year and down 21 basis points sequentially. Total postpaid device activations were up 3.0%, of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.6%, up from 5.4% year over year, and was 43 basis points higher sequentially. During the quarter, 6.2 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid net adds of 19,000 were up year over year and sequentially due to our stronger value proposition. Let's turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.9% in the second quarter as compared to a 5.1% decline in the first quarter. Service revenue declined 6.7% versus a 6.1% decrease in the previous quarter. This trend was primarily due to the lost overage revenue driven by plans introduced during summer of 2016 and the introductory unlimited offer. As we discussed during our last earnings call, we expected weaker year-over-year service revenue through the first half of the year, primarily due to line access and overage revenue trends. At the end of the second quarter, about 59% of our accounts have tools that offer customers the ability to self-manage their usage experience. During the second quarter, we experienced an improvement in the rate of decline in line access revenue, as we now have roughly 75% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans. We expect this trend will continue which, combined with adding new accounts and migrating customers to higher access points, will mitigate the lost overage revenue. Therefore, we believe the service revenue trend has flattened, and we expect that there will be an improving trend in the second half, and we should exit the fourth quarter inside a decline of 4.0%. In the second quarter, equipment revenue increased 16%. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, as compared to approximately 76% in the first quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan at the end of the quarter. Our wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 45.8%. The movement in the service revenue trend will also positively impact wireless EBITDA margin. Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total wireline revenue on a reported basis grew 1.2%, including the recently acquired XO operations. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.8% compared to a decline of 3.2% last quarter. This shift in the wireline revenue trend towards fiber is growing. Organically, fiber based products grew more than 3%, which supports our plans to further invest in fiber. Our emphasis on delivering value to all business customers, from the very small to the large enterprise, was recognized recently in a leading third-party study. More importantly, we won the large enterprise business award for the second consecutive year in the same study. Consumer markets revenue increased 0.6%, driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue growth of 4.1% was consistent with the past several quarters. During the quarter, we launched Fios Gigabit Connection in certain markets, which offers symmetrical speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. In Fios Internet, we added 49,000 customers. Fios Video results were pressured due to softer secular demand for traditional linear video, given growth in the over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 15,000 in the quarter. For the second quarter, Enterprise Solutions revenue fell 4.1% on an organic basis, which was due to persistent trends in our legacy products and pricing compression in the marketplace. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 3.5%. Partner Solutions revenue declined 6.8% on an organic basis, while the revenue mix towards fiber has been trending higher. Within business markets, fiber revenue is expanding, driven by Fios broadband demand, offset by continued pressure in legacy products. On an organic basis, revenue declined 4.9% and improved slightly sequentially. On a comparable basis, the second quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 20.8%, compared to 13.3%, which included the work stoppage, last year. Sequentially, wireline EBITDA margin was down 120 basis points, primarily due to lower revenue from Enterprise Solutions and Partner Solutions and an increase in operating expense as a result of leasing data center space related to the sale to Equinix. Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. On June 13, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets. Upon closing, we launched Oath, which is a combination of AOL and Yahoo brands, serving approximately 1 billion unique monthly users globally, and currently represents about $7 billion in annual revenue. We have been planning the integration of AOL and Yahoo for the past year and immediately began executing on integration plans upon closing. We expect to realize over $1 billion in cumulative operating expense synergies through 2020. We are in the very early stages of leveraging the scale of the combined assets to distribute and monetize content through programmatic advertising across our Sports, Finance, News, and Entertainment properties. These properties will provide unique advertising opportunities to targeted global audiences. Organically, AOL's revenue net of traffic acquisition costs was consistent with prior year's results in the quarter. As the integration progresses, we will provide additional information on the Oath business. Organically, IoT revenue, including telematics, increased approximately 20% in the second quarter. Telematics revenue was approximately $220 million in the quarter. Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our wireless and wireline assets to ensure that we have capacity, reduce the cost to serve, and to preposition the networks for the future. Our value proposition to our wireless customers is to provide a full network experience including reliability, coverage, and speed. We are on our wireless network plan to deliver the industry's best overall experience for our customers. Our network experience continues to be recognized by multiple third-party studies as the industry leader. Since the launch of unlimited, two of these studies have reconfirmed our network leadership in overall performance, including speed and voice quality over LTE. As expected, the introduction of the unlimited pricing plan increased the LTE network usage as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day on the industry-leading wireless network. We are confident in our network and have been engineering the network based on a long-term integrated plan to extend our high-quality experience while expanding our value proposition to customers. We remain focused on delivering increasing capacity over the long-term, utilizing a three-pronged approach: first, network features; second, densification; and, third, spectrum. Let's discuss each of these in detail. First, we are methodically deploying LTE Advanced features to increase capacity on our network resources and align with the timing of smartphone introductions that can take advantage of these features. Second, small cells are playing a vital role in creating capacity. The densification efforts have been a focal point of our network strategy over the past several years. This density also creates increased spectral efficiency and offers the best wireless experience. Finally, with nearly all of our network traffic now on the 4G LTE Advanced network, we are utilizing just over 50% of our low and mid-band spectrum portfolio for this network. We expect to use more of our PCS spectrum for LTE and are just beginning to redeploy 850 megahertz spectrum in certain markets. In addition, we are deploying AWS-3 and will start to add unlicensed spectrum later this year. Our spectrum deployments in conjunction with multicarrier aggregation technology are enabling us to increase network capacity. Our overall wireless network integrates features, densification, and spectrum to enable a step function increase in wireless network capacity over the long term. Fiber is a critical element in transforming both wireless and wireline networks to reduce costs and expand future capabilities. To enhance this strategy, our recent announcements to secure fiber demonstrates our commitment to increase our multiuse fiber footprint and build fiber deeper into the network. On the 5G wireless front, we are up and running in eight out of the 11 precommercial fixed wireless broadband trials on the millimeter-wave spectrum. We have the first batch of customers on the network. We will have trial results towards the end of the year that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments. Let's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. We are executing on our plan to lead in network, preserve and grow our customer relationships, and expand our presence in digital media and telematics to deliver fundamental results while allocating capital to continue to invest in our operations and return value to our shareholders. We delivered strong wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment. We evolved our wireless value proposition while driving profitable growth and reconfirming network leadership based on third-party study results. We expect that we will create incremental capital and operational efficiencies that result in additional cash generation. Our 5G strategy is progressing for fixed and mobility use cases, standards, spectrum resources, and fiber investments. Now that we have completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and introduced the Oath brand, our media business is focused on the integration plans, and we'll look to increase engagement on our platforms. In telematics, we see additional growth opportunities with our Fleetmatics and Telogis assets. We remain confident in our strategy, which puts us in a strong position to compete today and into the future while delivering long-term value to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Thank you, Matt. Eunice, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citi Research: Hi, good morning. Two questions if I could. One, I'm curious if you could delve a little bit further into the competitive environment. Last earnings call you provided a perspective of the how net adds and gross adds flowed over the quarter. I was wondering if you could do the same thing just so we could frame what was driving the improvement in your performance this quarter on the phone add out of the equation. And then secondly, just on 5G, if you can give us an update where you are with the trials and maybe if you have an update on the economics that you're seeing from those deployments. Thanks.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. So on the competitive environment through the quarter, I would say we saw it \u2013 outperformance in the quarter was pretty even. You saw the churn number; we came in at 0.70%. That certainly contributed to the net adds and shows that once we had a comparable offer out there against the competition, I mean, by being unlimited where the other guys are unlimited. Even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver, and we saw that throughout the quarter. So even as we headed into the back end of the quarter and the competitive environment picked up and some of the other offers that came out there, whether that be large bounties to switch carrier or offering free service, our performance in the back end of the quarter was consistent with where we saw it in the first part of the quarter. So we saw a great result from customers on both the gross adds side and the loyalty side once they had that comparable offer to do. So very excited about how that played out. As we head forward, second quarter is typically, seasonally, the low quarter for churn. So while we certainly expect churn to continue to be at low levels, we'll see if we get a normal seasonal uptick as we go forward. But from a competitive environment standpoint, I think we showed that we competed throughout the quarter without having to put any aggressive promotions in place in the market at any time during the quarter. In terms of 5G, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, we now have the trials up and running. It's going to be later in the year before we start to see results out of those trials. And then, in terms of the business model and economics that may come of that, it will be driven by the results we see from the trials. So too early right now to be more definitive on that, but we're still confident that we'll have a commercial product in market during 2018 and look forward to providing more details on what's coming out of the trials and the overall economics that we see when we get into the latter part of the year.\nMichael I. Rollins - Citi Research: Thanks very much.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Okay, thanks, Mike. Eunice, next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys, thanks. First, can we talk about your small cell rollout? Where are we in the path of that? I know it's a multiyear effort, but how far are we into the small cell rollout and densification? And, second, can you talk about the competitive environment in video and broadband? As you add up the OTT trends and traditional video losses, do you see an acceleration in cord cutting, or does it just seem like customers are spreading out among more video service providers? Thanks.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Phil. Good morning. So on the small cell rollout, we're exactly where we planned to be. I mean, our capital plan for the year, we're right on where we planned to be at the start of the year. And we are now \u2013 I would say we have small cell builds in all of the top metro markets at this point, and that's one of the reasons we have the network performance that we've had. We saw confirmation of that as recently as yesterday with another one of the third-party surveys that proves that during the first quarter of 2017, even once we were on unlimited, our network performs better than anybody else's, and that's in large part due to what we've been doing for the past number of years on small cell densification. I know you hear a lot of other people talk a lot about small cell densification now. Remember that we've been doing that for a longer time period than anyone else, and that's why we're in all of the top metro markets. And we will continue to do that. That will be a continued part of our network capacity plan. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have the long-term network plan that's based off continuing to deploy the spectrum that we own against the LTE network, densification, and the LTE tools that are available. So densification continues to be a very important part of our network plan.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Is there a point, Matt, at -\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: From a competitive environment (28:09) in the broadband and TV space, I think what you saw is we had a continued strong performance on the broadband side, but we also see the ongoing secular trend around video. So we continue to add high-quality broadband customers and will continue to compete on the video side, but certainly we do that in the face of the secular trends that are ongoing.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Is there a point, Matt, at which the small cell densification effort sort of starts to slow down in a few years, or is this a constant effort for the next three, five years?\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: I think it continues. It's not just around 4G, as we've talked in the past. As we see 5G being deployed on millimeter-wave spectrum, that's going to require a small cell deployment, and so as we put the densification in place of 4G, we're doing it in mind knowing that we've got the 5G that will be using the same dark fiber in other assets. So the densification activity will continue here for a good number of years.\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, Matt.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Eunice, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thanks. Matt, maybe can we get some more color on a couple of the forward-looking sort of items you gave us on the wireless side? First on the service revenue. It was down 6.7%, but you said that it would start to sort of flatten in the second half. And then the 4% sort of year-end exit run rate. Can I assume we're looking at something around 6.7% for the third quarter and then improvement, something in the sort of 5% range for the fourth quarter? Just if you could put some color there. And then some similarly on the margins. You said as the service revenue improves we'd see some improvement in the margins. Total margins in wireless have been down a little bit in the first half, you know in each quarter. Are you sort of suggesting it'll be down less in the second half? Or do you think that as we see the improvement into the year, obviously, there's some crosscurrents with the new phone, but could we get back up flat or even positive comps on the margin? Thanks.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, John. So on the service revenue, I think consistent with what we said earlier in the year, we see second quarter as being the low point and the 6.7% for 2Q will become something better then in 3Q. And in my prepared remarks I believe I \u2013 you heard me say that we'll be inside of negative 4% in the fourth quarter. So in terms of how do we get there, we talked about that 75% of the base in second quarter was on unsubsidized pricing. That compares to 53% a year ago. So there's north of a 20-point movement from second quarter last year to second quarter this year. As you get into the back half of the year \u2013 I'll use fourth quarter as an example. Fourth quarter year-ago, that number was 67%. This year, that number is going top out in the upper 70s. So we're at 75% now. We'll get up to, let's say, 77%. That will only be a 10-point delta in the fourth quarter year over year. So that pressure that's come from taking customers from the subsidized model down to the unsubsidized pricing is starting to wane, and really the second quarter is where we reached the point, we've got essentially the vast majority of the consumer base now on unsubsidized pricing. And then overage revenues also being, obviously, part of the story here over the past few quarters, first with the introduction of the price plans last year that had the Safety Mode feature and then bringing on unlimited. As we said, we now have 59% of accounts on one of those two plans. Overage was actually down 34% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Now represents a low single digit percentage part of total service revenues. So we're working through that headwind. We'll work through that headwind a lot faster. And so, as I say, based off that, I am very confident we'll be inside negative 4% in fourth quarter, and by the time we get on this call a year from now and our comparison is against this year being 75% on unsubsidized pricing, we'll be having a very different conversation about the service revenue trajectory next year. And then on margin improvement, as you know, service revenue is the highest margin component of our business, so as the trajectory on service revenue improves, the trajectory on margin will improve as well.\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Eunice, next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys, thanks a lot. I guess two if I could. I just wanted to follow up on that service revenue question, Matt. I mean, the math kind of suggests that by fourth quarter your service revenue will actually be growing from where it is in the second quarter. And I wonder if you could kind of talk about the inputs to that expectation in terms of kind of what you expect from a competitive pricing environment, promotions with the iPhone, et cetera, relative to that mix shift that you've been talking about, as you kind of go past the price down cohort and you move into this group of people that are kind of more pricing up. If you could talk about those two dynamics as kind of the inputs as your base case, would be helpful. And then the second question, if I could, would be on the media segment. I mean, if you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on what is that thing growing at today and what will it look like in the future? I guess we've talked about maybe turning down the search business and how that business might transform over the next six months or year, would kind of be helpful to kind of understand what that unit is going to look like. Thanks.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Yeah, good morning, David. Thank you. So the inputs to service revenue. Really as you think about that trajectory changing, when you've got growing accounts, growing net adds, when you see the continued improvement in the delta on the non-subsidized pricing and as we work through the overage, all of that will combine to a much stronger trend as we go forward from where we have been. In terms of the impact of any new devices coming along, look, we assume that we'll see something later in the year. We typically have very strong results when we have new devices come out because when customers get a new device with new functions, they want it on the best network, but we'll see what happens there. And certainly would expect that to be accretive to the overall revenue story. But our guidance for the year doesn't require any major uplift as a result of that. And then the media side, look, I will say it was very early in the process of integrating those two businesses. As we said, the revenue of AOL less TAC was flat year over year in the quarter. Tim and the team are just getting started integrating those two businesses. They're about 45 days in at this point. The integration is going well, and I look forward to being able to provide more color and commentary about exactly what they're seeing as they go forward. But as you heard Tim say a couple of months ago, the goal here is to grow this to north of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, and nothing that's happened since we closed has changed our view on that.\nDavid Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thanks, Matt.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Eunice, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. A question for Matt. And if I'm reading your guidance correctly, it seems like you effectively reiterated your outlook for the year, including what implies roughly a flattish EPS trend. There were a few moving parts this quarter. You did the Equinix data enter deal, and I think that may have been slightly dilutive to earnings. And, of course, you completed the acquisition of Yahoo. So I was hoping maybe you could just unpack your outlook for the full year and maybe let us know the extent to which those transactions may have been accretive or dilutive to your trends for the balance of 2017. Thanks.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Brett. So the guide, if you look at the language on the revenue side, we said we'd be reasonably consistent on an organic basis. So as we think about that, we would remove out anything that wasn't in the business for all of 2016-2017. So certainly the impact of those businesses have been having about $0.02 a quarter on EPS, so when I think about the guide going forward, it's on an organic basis. Still feel very confident organically we'll be in a consistent place to where we were a year ago, and then we'll bake in the impact of the various acquisitions as we go forward.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So does that imply that it's actually additive to your full-year outlook? (37:25)\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: As we get into each of those businesses, certainly from a revenue standpoint they are additive to the outlook. From an earnings standpoint, some of those businesses have an initial pressure as we integrate them, but not material to the earnings outlook.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then just a different question. As we think about unlimited, and you were talking about doing more digital customer interactions and customer care, have you already started to see a benefit there? In other words, as your customer base has moved to unlimited plans, is that cohort contacting you less frequently? And could this be a real area of offset to some of the overage that you're losing on the top line?\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, certainly with customers on unlimited they have fewer reasons to call. But we continue to want to improve the customer experience, and when customers can do things by themselves through a digital channel at the time they want to do it, that increases overall satisfaction, and it certainly allows us to improve the efficiency of the business. So we're continuing to do that, and we think unlimited certainly helps us do that as well.\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Eunice, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: Hi, thank you. Matt, I wonder if we could return to the network densification conversation you had a few moments ago. Can you talk about how you think about the trade-off specifically between acquiring more spectrum and network densification, and from an economics perspective, and has that shifted at all inside of Verizon? I mean, my sense is you're much different than a year or so ago. You spend less time talking about new spectrum acquisition. Is that a fair characterization?\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Look, we continue to look at that trade-off. It really comes down to taking a view on the most efficient way to add the capacity that we need, and we've talked for two or three years now about the fact that we believe based off of the valuations that spectrum have reached in some places, it's more efficient to densify. And certainly the costs of densification, just like with any technology, have come down to some degree since we started densifying with small cell. So the overall analysis we do hasn't fundamentally changed. Look, we continue to add spectrum from the secondary markets, too. So when spectrum is priced at the right level, we continue to be active in that space, too. And we just look at the relative economics between densifying and adding spectrum. But densification has proved to be a very effective way of adding capacity into what places we need to and from a cost efficiency standpoint as well.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks, Matt, and if I could just ask a quick follow-up. I'm going to risk putting words in your mouth, but is it fair to say that you still believe, broadly speaking, that network advantage is still possible and within reach for Verizon with the network densification strategy?\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Look, I think the results speak for themselves on this one, Craig, and whether it be the third-party results that you've seen, again, just in the last 24 hours. But even in an unlimited world, the third-party results clearly show that Verizon has the best network. And then when you look at our subscriber metrics for the quarter, once we were on a comparable basis, we saw record low churn down 0.70%, and we also saw a strong net add number. So the idea that network differentiation doesn't matter to customers \u2013 quite frankly, the results from our base show that that's not true and customers do value the benefit of a differentiated network experience even when it's at a premium pricing, which is where ours is. We wouldn't get those results if a better network experience didn't matter to customers. Clearly it does.\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Eunice, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys, thanks. Matt, maybe just a little deeper on the churn that we saw in the quarter \u2013 obviously a very strong result there. Is it an impact from more EIP customers and sort of the equipment balances keeping people steady? Was there anything you guys were doing with respect to protecting the base with maybe proactively moving to unsubsidized without the EIP payments? And then just following up again on the guide on service revenue, what's the more important driver here for the year? Is it handset additions maintaining sort of a positive posture, or is it the ARPA starting to turn? Or, obviously, it could be a combination of both.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on the churn, look, there's no magic in here. It's not that we've got more customers on EIP or we've been doing things behind the scenes to protect the base. It's around the quality of the experience. And customers see that quality of the experience, and they want to be on that experience rather than something else. So we're very, very happy with that number there, and it's just a reflection of what we give customers. In terms of the guide on service revenue, I think the biggest piece that you have in there is the continued migration of the base to the non-subsidized pricing plans. In the back half of the year, the year-over-year comps are against higher numbers there versus the first half of the year, and that's going to drive improvement in service revenue. Certainly net account growth is an important contribution, but I think just, though, the movement of the base and in unsubsidized, that's the trend we've been talking about, and we certainly see that ahead of us.\nMichael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: And, Matt, maybe just a quick follow-up on thoughts on towers. I know one of your \u2013 your biggest competitor, I guess, is looking for alternatives. Are you guys also evaluating some of those things?\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: We continue to look at all ways to manage the network at the most efficient pricing that we have, whether that be how we talk to towers or all the other resources we have in front of us.\nMichael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC: Great, thanks, Matt.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Eunice, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nJennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you for taking the question. Matt, if I may, on the spectrum side, I know you've talked much about densification, but you did mention other spectrum sources. It looks like there's going to be a 3.5 gigahertz auction possibly next year. And it seems like Verizon's done much lobbying for that effort. In your spectrum kind of wish list, is it fair to say you're probably more focused on higher-band spectrum at this point? Or if you could comment on that. And then second, if I may, on the One Fiber initiative, it's certainly early to call 2018 CapEx, but do you still feel comfortable that, with the fiber plans you've laid out, or some which we know about, some we probably don't, that that really won't be a huge increase in the CapEx lever next year? Thanks.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Thanks, Jennifer. So on the spectrum wish list, look, we're very confident in the portfolio of spectrum that we have, certainly in low band and mid-band, and we have a significant amount of spectrum still to deploy against the LTE network. We'd certainly be interested in the 3.5 [gigahertz] and look forward to that coming forward, but as I say, we're very confident in the spectrum that we still have to deploy. From a CapEx standpoint next year, look, it's too early to get into the guide next year, but as we think about how we deploy fiber and so on, that will be part of the plans, and we'll share those as we get towards the latter part of the year and certainly into January, when we provide the full-year guide.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Okay. Jennifer, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt, you talked a little bit about some of the pressures in the video business from over-the-top. How is Verizon thinking about that opportunity? Is there a case for you to have your own over-the-top product to compete? And how do you think \u2013 I know on convergence you've typically been conservative, but we're seeing a lot more of these converged wireless plus over-the-top offerings. And maybe just touching, then, on M&A and what your interest is in potentially owning more content to have some exclusive product for your customers. Thanks.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Simon. So on over-the-top, look, nothing to say. We're always looking, but we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to be competitive in that space and if it needs to be part of the portfolio or not. From a convergence standpoint, again, we're very comfortable with the product offerings we have today, and if there is more convergence, we certainly believe that will take place on our networks, and we'll be effective as being part of that. And then from an M&A standpoint, look, we're very comfortable with the assets we have today. If there's an opportunity to add something that accelerates the strategy at a reasonable price, we will. But we think we have the assets we need to be effective at this point in time.\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Eunice, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could touch upon sort of that network focus and the most efficient means to build additional capacity. When we think about your fiber footprint, you folks have certainly augmented it via acquisitions as well as some of the announcements that you've made to build out capacity. Where does it stand at this juncture in terms of not just the fiber footprint itself, but having the right type of fiber assets to deploy 5G? And how do you expect to augment that capacity going forward?\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. So as we think about the fiber we need for the business, certainly we need more going forward, as we've discussed in the past. The way that we're going to add that capacity will be probably through a combination of buying fiber that already exists if it's the right type of fiber. We can build fiber, and we can certainly lease. And we were doing that on top of some of the assets we already own, and add in the XO, those fiber metro rings earlier in the year gives us the base on which we will continue to do some of that. So fiber will continue to be very important the higher we build the network, not just for wireless but also various wireline applications, including Smart City deployments. So more to come there as we go forward.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful, Matt. And then just dovetailing on the prior commentary on over-the-top, just want to try and put those comments that you had made in terms of evaluating options with some of the comments that seem to have been made previously about you folks putting together an offering. I mean, has that changed in terms of timing or what your strategy is for over-the-top?\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: I'd say there's no change to our strategy at this point in time.\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. Thanks very much for the incremental color.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Great. Eunice, we'll take one more question, please, and then we'll wrap up.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, guys, and thanks, guys, and congratulations on a good quarter. Matt, the unlimited side, and incredible impact here, do you think this is sustainable? Are you seeing any slowdown at all? Maybe \u2013 I'm not sure if you said on the call \u2013 what percentage of your base are on unlimited or maybe a flow share. And then not to pound you on wireless margins, but it sounded like you kind of expect them to trend up for the next several years, not just for this quarter. Do you think we can get back to, on a consolidated basis, the type of margins we saw last year or even better than that? And I guess just lastly how do you balance out the growth in subscribers with the margins that you're generating which are still, obviously, industry-leading? Thanks.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So, look, I absolutely think the trend on unlimited is sustainable. Once we gave customers that clear and comparable offer, we see the value of our network and our offering compared to what else is in the marketplace. And, look, we'll see how the marketplace evolves going forward. But we're very confident that we will be competitive as that happens. From a margin improvement standpoint, look, as service revenue trends improve, we would expect that to flow through into margins. And then also we continue to have ways to take cost out of the business and improve efficiencies in the business, too. So you should think about that as you think about how we go forward in the wireless performance.\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you.\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Okay, great. And with that, I'd like to just turn the call back over to Matt on this busy earning morning.\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. We remain confident in our strategy of investing in our networks while maintaining and expanding our high-quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well-positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry in the 5G ecosystem with our strong network assets. We have the opportunity to do the things at scale while delivering value across our portfolio in order to generate shareholder value. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

And welcome to Verizon First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions, following the presentation [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMichael Stefanski: Thanks, Junis. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides, are available on the Investor Relations Web site. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our Web site. Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our Web site. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our Web site. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before Matt goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of the $0.84 per share on a GAAP basis, which included about $0.02 of earnings pressure, primarily related to recent business acquisitions. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight. Our reported first quarter earnings include a pre-tax early debt redemption charge of about $850 million and a non-cash pre-tax gain on a Spectrum License Transaction of roughly $125 million. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $435 million or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.95 in the first quarter compared to $1.06 a year ago. Recall that our first quarter 2016 adjusted EPS included $0.10 of earnings related to the three Wireline properties that we sold to Frontier. During the first quarter, we reorganized the customer groups within the Wireline segment. On April 11th, we released unaudited historical results recast for the four customer groups, including Verizon Business Markets, a new group that consist of U.S. based small and medium size businesses, state and local governments and educational institutions. This new group was formed to increase the focus on these markets. The historical total segment revenues remain unchanged from previously reported results. As a reminder,. we are still subject to the FCC and inclusion rules relate to the Spectrum auction, so we\u2019ll not be able to answer spectrum related questions. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. As outlined in our earnings call in January, our priorities for 2017 are to leverage our network leadership, retain and grow our high-quality customer base while balancing profitability, enhance ecosystems in Media and Telematics, and drive monetization of these networks and solutions. We are executing against these priorities while positioning the business for the long-term as we progress through 2017. The first quarter of 2017 proved to be a very active quarter for us; first, we extended our network leadership, as recognized by third party testing results; second, we launched an introductory unlimited wireless data plan to address evolving customers\u2019 demand in a highly competitive environment; third, we realigned our operating themes to enable business agility to deliver new products and next generation services. Verizon's core strength and the foundation of our future success in a connected world starts with the network, and we have enhanced our track record of U.S. industry leadership. We are consistently investing in our network to extend our leadership in both 4G and 5G. We also closed the acquisition of XO Communications fiber assets in the quarter. Our uncompromising commitment to our customers led to the launch of an introductory unlimited offering in the quarter. This measured approach in a competitive and highly penetrated wireless phone environment was positively received by both the consumer market and more importantly, our existing customer base. Our competitive unlimited offer, coupled with networks strength and reliability, allows us to attract, retain and grow high-value customer relationships across our entire business. At the end of the first quarter, we announced the realignments of our operating teams to facilitate organizational agility in wireless and fiber markets to scale and expand our Media and Telematics businesses and to maintain leadership in network reliability and new technology. These changes do not affect our segment reporting. We are confident in our strategy and priorities to provide the best network experience in the U.S., create long lasting customer relationships and identify growth opportunities in new businesses. Executing these strategies will enable us to continues to deliver returns on our investments and drive long-term value for our shareholders. Let's review the first quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by Wireless and Wireline results, Media and Telematics progress and a network technology update. Now on to slide six. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions in the period, consolidated revenue declined approximately 4.5%. The primary driver was a decrease in wireless service revenue resulting from the migration to the new pricing structures introduced over the past nine months, and the ongoing transition of the base to unsubsidize pricing. These pricing moves have been positively received in the marketplace. On a consolidated basis, excluding non-operational items, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.3%, which was slightly higher year-over-year due to steady improvement in operating efficiencies and cost management. Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide seven. We are generating substantial cash flows from our operating segments. Cash flow from operations is $1.7 billion, which included discretionary pension contributions of $3.4 billion. Additionally, our ongoing asset-back securitization program provided $1.3 billion in the quarter, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The discretionary pension contributions are net present value positive on an asset tax basis given the reduction in our variable rate PBGC premiums and the expected net return on planned assets. As a result of these contributions, our mandatory pension funding through 2020 is expected to be minimal, which will benefit future cash flows and improve the funded status at our qualified pension plan. Also, the rating agencies view debt funded pension contributions as neutral to credit rating metrics. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we are investing in our networks. Our capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, and we expect capital spending for the year to be within our 2017 guided range. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $116.5 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $110.2 billion of unsecured debt and $6.3 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. During the quarter, we completed multiple capital market transactions, including new debt issuances to fund the discretionary pension contributions, the acquisition of XO and to pre-fund the acquisition of Yahoo. These transactions included a $3.1 billion tender offer and $9 billion debt exchange, which reduced future cash interest costs and extended maturities. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe. Now, let's move into review to the operating segments, starting with Wireless and the impacts of Unlimited on slide eight. In our Wireless business, we have extended our network leadership position, while balancing operational performance in a competitive environment. Verizon is the U.S. market leader across high-value postpaid phone customers, and we have consistently stated that our top priority is protecting our base to build on our customer relationships into the future. During the first quarter, we made a disciplined decision to launch an unlimited offering, so let's spend a few minutes on the factors leading to our decision. As discussed on the last earnings call, we launched wireless plans in mid-2016 that offered safety mode and carry over data, reducing overage charges. Since the launch, the U.S. wireless phone market experienced greater competition with unlimited plans from other carriers. We chose to compete using equipment promotions during that time, while we evaluated different service pricing options, including Unlimited. At the start of 2017, competitive intensity escalated, resulted in loss of gross add share and an uptick in churn pressure. So we determine that the timing was right for the introduction of an unlimited option at the high-end of our existing plans. We are confident in our network capability to efficiently manage the expected usage growth from unlimited, because we have invested in technology, architecture and densification. Our early network performance is consistent with our high-quality of service expectations and within the current network plan. The customer response to the launch was favorable as evidenced by an immediate improvement in subscribe activity in the second half of the quarter. In the quarter, in which we added 49,000 smartphones, our phone net-adds had two distinct trajectories. Prior to our Unlimited launch, we had retail postpaid phone net losses of 398,000 customers. After the launch, we added 109,000 retail postpaid phone customers, which gives us momentum entering the second quarter. Overall in the first quarter, we lost 307,000 postpaid customers, consisting of phone losses of 289,000 and tablet losses of 255,000 offset by other connected devices. We introduced the Unlimited offering, primarily to protect our high quality base, and we achieved the desired impact as retail phone churn improved after the launch and was less than 0.9% for the eighth consecutive quarter despite heights and competition in the marketplace. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.15% increased year-over-year due to higher tablet churn, which is expected to remain elevated throughout the year as customers roll-off for free capital promotions from prior years. Total postpaid device activations were down almost 9% over the year prior, of which about 82% were phones. In a seasonally soft quarter, we had 5.2% of our retail postpaid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.8% last year. During the quarter, 5.7 million phones were activated on device payment plans. While we may progress in the prepaid market, this remains an area of opportunity for us, as prepaid devices declined by 17,000 in the quarter as compared to a decline of 177,000 in the prior year. Let's turn to slide nine and take a closer look at Wireless revenue and profitability. Total Wireless operating revenue declined 5.1% in the first quarter. We experienced the change in the service revenue trend, which had been improving sequentially. Service revenue declined 6.1% year-over-year compared to the 4.9% decrease in the previous quarter. The service revenue pressure was a result of decreased overage revenue, lower postpaid customers in the quarter and promotional activity. Overage pressure was primarily related to the ongoing migration to the pricing plans implemented last year and the introduction of Unlimited offerings. As expected, optimize as we benefit the most from stepping down in price, primarily single line users, were the early adopters of these plans. We believe this revenue trend will persist through the first half of the year, but remain confident that these plans will be up and neutral over-time as more users step-up in price, which has already taken place. New customer accounts added after the unlimited launch on average had higher account access fees. While we absorb overages in the near-term, we expect that the increase in account access fees will replace overages overtime. Equipment revenue decreased 4.8% in the first quarter. Sequentially, the percentage of phone activations on device payment plans remain steady at approximately 76% in the first quarter compared with about 77% in the fourth quarter. We expect the second quarter device payment plan take rate to remain consistent. At the end of the quarter, approximately 48% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan, while about 71% were in unsubsidized pricing. Our Wireless EBITDA margin, as a percent of total revenue, was 45.1% which was down due to the service revenue trend and the increased advertising activity associated with the unlimited plan launch. Let's move next to our Wireline segment on slide 10. At the beginning of February, we completed the acquisition of XO Communications which contributed revenue to enterprise solutions, partner solutions and business markets for about half of the quarter. Excluding XO, Wireline segment revenues maintained recent trends, declining 3.2%. Consumer markets revenue increased 0.7%, which was driven by favorable pricing, partially offset by lower customer demand. In Fios Internet, we added 35,000 customers for the quarter, over 22% of our broadband customers are in plans with speeds of 100 megabits per second or more. Fios video losses of 13,000 in the quarter were indicative of softer demand from linear video due to the increase in over-the-top offerings, mobile video consumption and competitive promotional offers, particularly in the New York market. On an organic basis, Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 4.3% in the quarter as a result of pricing pressure in the market. On a constant currency basis, this decline was 3.7%. The customer migration from legacy services, such as voice, to advanced communications product is generating a revenue headwind in the near term, while increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing serving cost over the long term. Wireline segment EBITDA margin increased to 22.7% for the quarter, up from 19% last year. Tight cost controls plus impact of last year's renegotiated labor contracts improved profitability. We expect full year improvements in margins with seasonal fluctuations throughout the year. Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss their progress in new businesses. In our Media business, AOL continues to deliver solid seasonal performance with growth in gross revenue. Revenue, net of traffic acquisition costs, decreased about 4% driven by a higher percentage of programmatic advertising. Along with our content assets, AOL\u2019s ADTECH capabilities have enabled us to provide unique content across multiple platforms. We have assembled video platforms to leverage the growing customer demand for digital media. Our targeted content pillars, focusing on news, sports, finance and lifestyle, are already increasing the viewership. To provide the necessary scale to effectively leverage these assets, we are looking forward to combining AOL and Yahoo and operate in the combined businesses under the Oath brand. We are actively working on integration streams with Yahoo to ensure a smooth consolidation when the transaction closes, which is expected during the second quarter. Consistent with past quarters, digital video consumption on the go90 app maintained in average data usage of about 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% to the up-traffic served on the Verizon wireless network. During the quarter, the app was updated to improve the user interface, increase content discovery and enhance the programming and advertising capabilities. In the Telematics business, we are quickly integrating the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions. With these assets, we are the global market share leader and are looking to expand our offerings in this space. Total Telematics revenue was $214 million in the first quarter. Organically, IoT revenue, including Telematics, was up approximately 17% in the first quarter. Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our networks to ensure that overall quality and capacity remains ahead of demand. Capital spending of $3.1 billion in the quarter was largely network related to maintain leadership in our markets. Fiber is a critical component of our network strategy and next generation deployments, as demonstrated by the success of our densification initiative. Earlier this week, we announced the strategic agreement with Corning with whom we have a long-relationship to supply optical fiber and hardware solutions of at least $1.05 billion from 2018 to 2020. This investment ensures that we have adequate supply of fiber. In the first quarter, LTE data traffic increased 57% over the prior-year. While still early in the cycle, the increased data traffic resulting from Unlimited is in line with our expectations, and network management tools have been effective. We are committed to remain in the largest and most reliable 4G network through technological developments in LTE, deploying small cells and refarming mid-band spectrum. As part of the densification, we are deepening our fiber assets, enhanced by the XO transaction. As previously announced, we are launching 11 pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless pilots during the second quarter and we look forward to sharing the results later in the year. Let's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. Our long-term growth model is to lead in network, expand our customer relationships and develop new businesses in Media and Telematics. While executing on our strategy and positioning for future growth, in the quarter, we listen to our customers evaluated the marketplace and launched an unlimited offering in order to retain and grow our high quality customer relationships. We realigned our operating teams to increase business agility to deliver new products and next generation services and develop new ecosystems in Media and Telematics in order to monetize the rising data traffic on our network. Overall, we are confident in our strategy and ability to execute and deliver long-term value to our customers, partners and shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you, Matt. Junis, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Matt, you were talking about fiber, and during his Media appearances this week, Lowell noted that the Company does in fact have a pretty strong interest in adding more fiber to the network. And you've indicated that this could potentially be achieved through M&A. And when noting that hwsaid, yes, there\u2019s never really a perfect fit in terms of architecture. So my question is, what type of architecture are you looking to add to the network that you have today? And is it reasonable to assume that the choice you have to make, if you either do this organically through higher levels of capital investment or to do it inorganically through acquisitions, which could potentially result in the Company operating at higher leverage for longer than we have expected? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: So I think if you look at what Lowell said earlier in the week, as we look at the network and is consistent with all being saying for over a year ago, since we announced the fiber initiative in Boston, that as we look at the networks of the future, they are going to be built with a lot of fiber deep into the network and that network is going to be built for multiuse cases, not for a single use case; so it's going to deliver consumer to the home applications; it's going to deliver small business applications; it's going to light up enterprise buildings; and it's also going to deliver smart cities and IoT solutions too. So as we think about how you build that network out, you\u2019re going to need fiber that\u2019s not out there today, which is one of the reasons we had the announcement earlier this week to make sure that we have access to the physical fiber as we start to deploy it more in places like Boston around the country. Now as you say, the architecture doesn\u2019t exist today in terms of what we could acquire. So there is options here, we can go out we could build that fiber as we\u2019re doing in Boston. And we also look at every way that we get access to that fiber. That\u2019s what it\u2019s critically about, is getting access to the fiber we need to deliver the solutions that we\u2019re looking to do. And there\u2019s multiple ways we can get that. So depending on the location that may mean us building the fiber network. If there is great assets already in place and as the opportunity to acquire them at a good price then we would certainly look to do that. And then there is also other ways to work with partners thhrough leasing and other arrangements where we don\u2019t have to build or outright buy. So we will look at all those opportunities as how we get access to that fiber, do we need to build the network of the future and provide the solutions that our customers are going to want as we go forward. So as you say, we could do that organically and inorganically. We\u2019re very comfortable and confident in the assets we have and adding on to them ourselves. But if the right opportunity came along, we would look at that. And I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent about dealing that and we\u2019ve also been consistent about the impact on the balance sheet. We believe in a strong balance sheet. But if the right acquisition comes along that allows us to add shareholder values in the long run and it\u2019s the right thing for shareholders and all stakeholders in our business, we would look doing that. But we\u2019d do it in a way that certainly reflected the need to have a strong balance sheet.\nBrett Feldman: And just quick follow up. Is it fair to assume that if the choice was do it organically, it does require higher levels of capital investment? Because if the answer is no then I guess the follow up to that one would be, what would ultimately make an acquisition attractive, is it really just speed to market?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, there is a number of different assets, aspects to it that would make it attractive; speed to market; the quality of the assets, that\u2019s there; and we look at all those things. But ultimately, if we have to build it ourselves, we\u2019re comfortable doing so. And we think we can do that relatively within our investment plans.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Rollins: Two if I could, one of the net add disclosure around the over 100,000 net adds since the launch of Unlimited. Given the seasonality that exist in the first quarter, can you compare that to year-ago period and give us a sense of how net adds performed since Unlimited, relative to what it was last year over the same timeframe? And then secondly, as you look at building small cells, I was wondering if you could put the fiber deal into context in terms of how many small cell that could give Verizon, and then how long does it take to build that? I know it\u2019s a three year deal that got announced. But what's the pace that investors should be thinking about in terms of how many small cells Verizon can deploy in a 12-month period? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: So I'll start with your first one. We really don\u2019t breakout the quarter typically in terms of the net add numbers, and so. But when you look at year-over-year, what you\u2019re really looking at here is the impact of going to the unlimited. And really given our customers, the functionality that they are looking for and that was a decision we made, and you saw an immediate impact in our business. And we certainly do look at that the month-by-month. And I can tell you that this isn\u2019t a seasonality in the first quarter, the change we saw in the first quarter. But really the 398,000 negative number through the first half and in the positive 109 in the second half, was all about the response to Unlimited as opposed to any significant seasonality in the quarter. And then in terms of your second question on small cells, so the fiber deal isn\u2019t just about building small cells. Obviously, we will build small cells with this, but there would be other use cases as we go out. So we\u2019re not in a position today that to say the number of small cells that we will light up with this fiber agreement with Corning. I can tell you, we will continue to build the best performing wireless network across the country; and we use small cells, we use the new technologies in LTE; and moving into 5G to do that and this fiber will help us to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Matt, just a couple of questions on for the financials, first on the wireless side. The postpaid was down 5.8%, definitely a change in trend as you mentioned. You talked about the impact Unlimited had and the fact that it being that move happening mid-quarter. Should we expect that trend to worsen from here, or do you think you've gotten most of the -- it's been down out of the way? And then secondly in terms of the guidance, you kept the guidance for the year that you had despite revenues being down 4.5% and earnings being down by 10%. Could you talk a little bit about some of the drivers to getting back to flat on both of those metrics for the year? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: So I\u2019ll start with your first one around wireless revenues and the ARPA decline. So as I look through the quarter, and let's see what happened in the wireless revenues. We have the continuation of the migration of the base to unsubsidized pricing. But in addition to that, what we also saw was a reduction in overage revenues. And this really was as much about the continuation of people migrating to the plans we launched last summer with safety mode and roll over data as it was about Unlimited. We've seen a good amounts of our base already roll-over to those plans where the overage starts to decline. And as we go forward, we should expect to see that continue in the second quarter and then we expect we\u2019ll see the trend in wireless service revenue starts to improve in the second half of the year. So we do think you'll see another quarter of some pressure in wireless ARPA before we see it head-up again. And look the other piece that\u2019s in the wireless number is when we were down close to 400,000 net adds in the first part of the quarter that's -- those were revenues that we didn\u2019t bare on the second half of the quarter but we saw the reverse in those trends and look forward to that piece continuing. So on the guide, if I go back to the guide real quickie here, what we said is on organic basis we\u2019ll be fairly consistent. So when you look at the first quarter, a year ago was $1.06 and that included about $0.10 from the assets we sold to Frontier. This year, we had $0.95 and as Mike mentioned, there was about $0.02 of pressure in there from the acquisition. So I think we\u2019re in line there. From a revenue standpoint, they\u2019re down 4.5% from an organic basis year-over-year. As I said, the service revenue we expect to improve and the trajectory in the second half of the year. The big thing around the revenue for the year is going to be equipment revenue. And as we\u2019ve gone through the unsubsidized pricing, we recognized that equipment revenue at the time of the activation of handset; we\u2019ll see what happens in the back half of the year; we\u2019ll see the new devices that come to market; we\u2019ll see how the holiday season goes, and that will be a key driver of getting to that revenue target.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: I wonder, Matt, if you could just talk a little bit more believe capital spending for the year; you\u2019ve obviously talked a about densification support, but what range is quite wide; you reiterated that today wireless was quite like this quarter. And so how should we think about mid range low end, high end and the trajectory through the year? And we were certainly getting a lot of questions about your Corning deal, $1 billion is a big contract. But I think Lowell was making the point that that\u2019s consistent with your overall capital spending needs. So is this something where it\u2019s consistent with spending or expecting, or have been doing and continue to do? Or is this a real step up in your fiber spending? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: So on the last question, the Corning deal. And as you say $1 billion over three years, it\u2019s certainly not a small number. But when you look within the overall context of our capital spend, it certainly fits in there. So as we go and build out fiber assets, I think you\u2019ll see us do that within our total capital spend. Yes, you will see us spend more on fiber as we go forward. But historically, you\u2019ve seen moves within our capital spend between different components. So this increase in the fiber spend will be offset by reductions in other areas, and that\u2019s the trend you\u2019re seeing consistently for us. In terms of capital spend for the year, the first quarter was certainly a lower quarter and we sometime see. But the first quarter is often a low capital spend quarter for us. So that\u2019s about where we expected it to come in. In terms of the guide for the year, it's too early in the year to say exactly we will be in that range, I am confident we\u2019ll be in that range. And as we go through the year, we\u2019ll provide more insights into where we think we\u2019ll end up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: I guess a couple if I could. Just first one, could you be more specific with respect to exactly what XO Communications contributed in revenue and EBITDA terms to the Wireline businesses for the two months that it did in the quarter? And then also Matt it looks like taxes were actually a source of cash this quarter, but we are expecting cash tax outflows for the year. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And then lastly, just a housekeeping question, I guess based on the comments you made about exit rate for subscriber additions in 1Q. Should we be extrapolating that run rate performance into 2Q and rest of the year? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: So on XO Communication, I wouuld say, you'd see nominal impact at the earnings level from the transaction in the course of the quarter. Your question around cash taxes, what you\u2019re seeing there is that you say, first quarter is typically live from a cash taxes standpoint, just because of the timing of when payments are due. As you go through the year, previously we had said the cash taxes would converge closely with the ETR rate. Because of some of the activity we had in the quarter with the discretionary pension contribution and the liability management activity, with cash taxes we\u2019re now actually come-in in a lower rate than the ETR for the year. So that's an improvement to the cash expectation for the year. From an exit rate of the first quarter, it\u2019s too soon to say just purely extrapolate that number out. But certainly, we\u2019re very confident that the offering is resonated very strongly with the base; both in terms of improvements in churn and also an uptick in growth that, we continue to see that; the rest of the quarter will play out based off of new devices that hit the market; and then also the competitive response, especially as we head into Mother's Day and the Dads and Grads period in June. But we do look forward to a better trajectory from the business with an offer out there that\u2019s certainly resonating with customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick: One sort of short-one and maybe one longer; first, churn in handsets remains below 0.9%. But it sort of looks like it was up a lot year-over-year, or was the problem in the first six weeks of the year much more gross-add driven and not really a churn problem; and then second, and it sounds like Lowell was not on. But I thought the CNBC interview went really well and explain the fiber densification in 5G plan. But where his Bloomberg comments really, they were confusing, and I think they confused a lot of investors. Were they misconstrued, or did he really open the door on deals like this Disney, CBS and Comcast? And if so, what's changed since he clearly shot down speculation of interest in CBS in December? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: So on the churn question, I think it's, as you say, the first half of the quarter we did see an uptick in churn and then we saw it come back down in the second half with the response to Unlimited. Look, we had a lot of customers in the base who love being on the Verizon network and the performance they get. But certainly managing their data was a pain point, it was another thing to do within their lives. And so they was some interest from the Unlimited functionality and as other people are offering that, we saw some people choose to make that trade off between quality of network, but not having to manage their data. And so as soon as we went to the Unlimited offering and we gave people the option of not having to make a trade-off, they could have unlimited data and beyond the best network we saw an immediate improvement in the churn number where our base saying this is where we want to be. And we\u2019re certainly seeing that continue as we head into the second quarter. Now your second question, so okay, there is obviously been a lot over the past 24-hours around this, so let's break this down. Lowell was asked a question in an interview about if a certain company called and wanted to talk, would he take that meeting. And he responded, sure we\u2019d take that meeting. And if emphasis he added on just like if a couple of other companies called, we\u2019d take the same meeting. What this really comes down to and is consistent with what he said on CNBC interview was, we\u2019re looking to how we execute our strategy; we\u2019re confident in executing our strategy organically. But if there is the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that adds shareholder value, we\u2019re always looking at those opportunities. But I think the story was a little taken out in context, he was answering a question about, if somebody called would we take a call and would we have a conversation with them. Of course, we would. But we\u2019re also very confident with the assets we have and the plans we have of developing the business in an organic fashion as well and generating shareholder value.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: So I know you\u2019re going to get tired of trying to be asked all the same questions the same way. But if I take your, the big answer that you just gave, describing the situation with respect to M&A. Is that to say that the status quo of your network densification strategy, do you view that as a sufficient solution then? And do you have confidence that that leads Verizon to a network superiority position? And then lastly, if you could just comment on, you talked about the momentum into the second quarter. Could you comment on whether you think the dynamics of the -- as we enter the second quarter, are actually a bit better, spread has moved off of it, some of its most aggressive promotions? Do you think that the competitive intensity has moderated even a little bit, or are we still in that same bad cycle that we were in Q1?\nMatt Ellis: So I'll take your first question then. But you mentioned, made a comment there Craig about re-lead in networks superiority, that would imply that at some point we didn\u2019t -- we have given up the lead in network superiority, and that clearly hasn\u2019t happened. You can look at any of the third party results of the testing they do over the past year, and you can see if anything we\u2019ve widen the lead. So network superiority will continue to be at the forefront of what we do. We\u2019re very confident that the customers value that. And we\u2019re very confident that we will lead as we move into 5G; we\u2019ll have that network out there first; have customer offering around that technology out there first; and that will give us an opportunity to work to continue to expand the business, just like we have with previous generations of technology. In terms of your dynamics in the second quarter in the marketplace, look we will have to wait and see. Right now, we\u2019re very happy with how the customer base is responding to the offers that we have out there. We\u2019ll have to see what the competition does. And we will continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but we will do that in a disciplined fashion. And we\u2019ll see other quarter plays out.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Just on the follow up question that network superiority, that\u2019s true every third party report seems to have Verizon by a widely ahead, but which leads to the question about spectrum. I realized you can't comment on the most recent auction. But can you just talk, Matt in general, how comfortable you are with your spectrum position as you sit now? And then four of the 11 markets, can you comment on what spectrum you\u2019ll be using for that last mile of the 5G?\nMatt Ellis: So for the 5G trials that we\u2019re doing, we're using the 28 gigahertz spectrum that we have the right to use as part of the arrangement we have with XO. In terms of your broader question about our spectrum position, we\u2019re very confident in it. Approximately 50% of our current spectrum holdings are delivering our 5G network today, so we have significant opportunity to -- about 4G usages there. We have significant opportunities to continue to grow within the spectrum holdings that we currently have; we\u2019re refarming spectrum as we've talked about for a while; we still have the AWS-3 spectrum; and then on license, we\u2019ll come into the portfolio we go forward to. In addition to using spectrum though, the way the spectrum is used continues to get more efficient based off of the network architecture and advancements in the technology; LTE advance we've talked a lot about, they continues to be additions to that. And so as we look forward, we\u2019re very confident that we have the spectrum we need to continue to deliver the best-in-class 4G experience.\nJennifer Fritzsche: And Matt, if I may, just one quick follow-up. So nothing you've seen since late February with the usage that's come from Unlimited. It seems like that nothing has changed in terms of the need for more spectrum, its just so be consistent with what your prior comments were.\nMatt Ellis: Yes, we obviously saw an uptick in usage, but it was expected. One of the reasons we waited until February to launch Unlimited was we said to oursevels if we're ever going to do Unlimited, we are not going to do it at the expense of the core brand promise, which is the network performance. And so we spend a lot of time in the back half of last year, asking ourselves is the network ready for Unlimited. We did a lot of testing around the network. And so we concluded that the network was ready for that. What we've seen since we launched from a usage standpoint and it's been in line with our expectations. The other important thing of course is when we launched it, we gave ourselves the opportunity to network manage when a user goes pass 22 gigs, and so that's an important point in managing the network in an unlimited world. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with the experience we've seen so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike McCormack: Matt, just maybe a comment on the margin trade-off of the ARPA changes that we've seen lot of promotional activity, and you guys have done some yourself there, that sort of versus the lower volumes that we're seeing out there. And I guess just trying to get a sense for whether or not wireless margins have seen their peak, if you will. And then with respect to the sub losses, Unlimited obviously had a positive impact. But it just seems like network quality is no longer resonating with consumers. I'm just trying to get a sense for how you guys think about differentiating against the peers going forward other just the simple rate card?\nMatt Ellis: So on your last comment around network quality resonating, I would say that completely disagree with that statement. We know from talking with our customers that network quality matters that they value the quality of our network. The fact that they have the reliability to get on the network and stay on the network work, no matter what they\u2019re doing or where they are, is tremendously important to them. And that shows up in the churn rate that we have coming in below 0.9% three quarters in a row and certainly, the improvement we saw there post launch. So this narrative that network no longer matters, I think we completely disagree with and I think that shows up in the numbers and the results that we show. In terms of the margin trade-off I think, look, when you\u2019re looking then to the ARPA decline this is a continuation of decline, because we're breaking apart the service revenue and the handset revenue. When you look at the ARPA number, which is really the billings we give to customer every month that includes the handset billing, that still up year-over-year. So we continue to feel good about that trajectory. And as you think about our move to Unlimited, we did it in a way where we will added the functionality but it wasn\u2019t a price reduction. We think that this ARPA will be ARPA neutral overtime. We\u2019ll initially seize the impact of optimizes and we\u2019ll also see the impact of reduced overage. But we also have the ability for customers to come on the network on a metered plan and then step up overtime, and even our base is stepping up from some of the lower data buckets to get on Unlimited. So there is some offsets there that we think means that Unlimited is not going to be a reduction in ARPA. And this is why we say when we introduced it, we did show in a disciplined fashion, which is something you should expect to see from us as we go forward and respond to the marketplace.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Just building upon that last question, when you folks originally introduced your outlook for 2017, there was an expectation for a push out in terms of the recovery or the growth of service revenues. Given where we are today, how should we think about the potential drivers for service revenue growth in future periods? You\u2019d originally called the Unlimited plan, introductory. And I am just trying to think about the different moving factors and where we could see that potential opportunity to drive service revenue growth in future, and then I\u2019ve just got one follow up from here.\nMatt Ellis: So on the trajectory, we still feel confident that we\u2019ll see an improvement in the wireless trajectory as we go through the year, and a stronger overall result from year-over-year number versus last year. Now, what we will see is in the second quarter we\u2019ll see a continuation of the impact of the optimizations, both through the customers that came onto the Verizon plan last summer and also on Unlimited. But then the back half of the year, we\u2019ll see the trend start to improve and we continue to be confident that we\u2019ll see wireless service revenue get back to positive on a year-over-year basis during 2018. So I think the big thing as you look there is we continue to keep pricing at the right levels. We have the opportunity to step customers up. And as we more successful in adding customers in the marketplace, as we showed in the back half of the quarter, that gives us the opportunity to move those trends in the right direction.\nAmir Rozwadowski: And then one follow up, and to some of the prior commentary you made. You discussed this idea of longer term shareholder value in the event that some opportune inorganic asset comes to market. What parameters do you gauge that shareholder value by? I know you have remained committed to de-levering the balance sheet to those pre-Vodafone levels during the 2018 and 2019 period. I was wondering, is there flexibility around that if the right asset was to present itself, or any color you can provide around that would be most helpful?\nMatt Ellis: So I think there has been a little surprise by some comments we\u2019ve made over the past few months around this. And really internally, there was no change in how we view this. We certainly have the target to get back to that leverage ratios and credit metrics as we discussed. But we\u2019ve always believed and maybe it's just because we\u2019ve said it more explicitly over the past few months. But look, if you give me two options; option A is, an opportunity comes up and I say no I can't do it because it mean I couldn\u2019t hit that leverage target; or option B is, I do a transaction that allows me to accelerate the strategy of the Company, improve my competitiveness in the marketplace and do it in a fashion that allows me to improve shareholder value versus the first option. But it means I have to push out when I get back to those leverage targets, is the right thing to do to do the second option. If it means we push that when we get to those targets because we have a great opportunity, we\u2019re going to do that. There is no change there. But I will say that we continue to be committed to a strong balance sheet, whether or not we have any inorganic activity.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nTim Horan: Matt, it seems like some of your competitors have really been aggressive on splashing OpEx and CapEx, and I know now just had a little bit more time to look at Verizon and what your competitors have done. I guess do you have the ability to do the same thing? And maybe a little color around the reorganization what that kind of mean in terms of expense reductions overtime? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: So I would say they have been talking about these reductions in OpEx over the past year or two. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about it for more years in that now. We continue to look at and manage the cost of the business down, and I think you see that in results. You certainly can see it clearly in the results in the Wireline segment, for example. So we look at managing OpEx and reducing it, not as a program for a year or two but something we do every year. Every year we have cost reduction targets for each of the business units and they diligently work on those and have a great track record of delivering them. As I think about CapEx, one of the great things about our business is we produce a significant amount of cash flow that allows us to continue to invest in the business. And we do that so that we position the business to be able to deliver products and offer our customers just for today but as we head into the future, because the nature of the business we\u2019re in, we're always looking at least one to two years out in terms of what we need. So we continue to do that and make sure that we're providing the connectivity solutions that our customers need as we go forward. However, saying that, we look at how we get -- continue to get more efficient in there. And you will see us continually do that, the cost to add capacity in the network continues to come down and it comes down because of the things our network team has done for many years and how we work with the vendors in the space. So we don\u2019t make as much of a big deal about what we do to manage OpEx and CapEx efficiencies. But I can absolutely guarantee you it's a key focus within the business and we have a great track record of doing that. In terms of the reorganization, I think look, this is just an opportunity to make sure we stay focused on the key things to us, which is the network and continuing to build the network; not just the network of today but the networks we need going forward; the focus on managing the customer base and growing the base, retaining the base and generating loyalty; and then generating those new businesses, whether that be in the Media Co, Telematics or the broad IoT space. So it was really to make sure the organization is aligned with those strategic goals of the Company.\nMichael Stefanski: Thank you for your questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt for some closing comments.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The first quarter showed our ability to compete effectively in a financially disciplined manner. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities, led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders. We are positioning the Company for long term growth; a key foundational element of our vision of the future is our strong network assets. Our strong networks will enable us to be at the center of this new connected world of people and things, and give us the opportunity to participate globally in the advancing digital ecosystems. We look forward to the tremendous opportunity to leverage all of our assets, and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-29 12:47:08", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. In addition to our comments today, on February 21st, Verizon will be hosting an Investor Day event in New York City, and we will be webcasting presentations by Hans and the leadership team. More information about this event will be posted on our IR website. Now, let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $0.47 per share and full-year earnings of $3.76 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings for the fourth quarter include a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $4.9 billion. This net loss consists of a previously announced goodwill impairment for Oath of $4.6 billion, acquisition and integration charges of $189 million, and severance and annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liability of $165 million.  In addition, we recognized the deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion related to an internal reorganization of wireless legal entities. Excluding the effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.12 in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $0.90 in the fourth quarter, up 4.7%, compared to $0.86 a year ago. On the same basis for the full-year, adjusted earnings per share excluding tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard was $3.87, up 3.5% compared to $3.74 a year ago. It has now been a full year since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated in the table on slide four. As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change was $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.28 per share for the full-year. The effect has been fairly consistent throughout 2018 with the fourth quarter slightly higher due to seasonality in wireless volumes. In 2019, we expect a smaller benefit from the adoption of the standard due to the deferral of commission costs. The reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year EPS headwind, which is expected to be about half of the 2018 impact in each of 2019 and 2020. For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted, financial results will exclude the impact of the revenue recognition accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods. With that, I will now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2018.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and good morning to everyone. This was truly a great year for Verizon. I\u2019m so proud of our team and what they have accomplished in 2018. As I traveled around and met with our employees and loyal customers, I have seen firsthand the great work that they are doing in pioneering solutions, focus on creating value and meeting customer needs. We\u2019re on the forefront of technology innovation as to provide our customers with fantastic experience on our networks. 2018 was a remarkable year. We delivered solid financials, returned value to our shareholders and strengthened our balance sheet as we continue on our trajectory to achieve a pre-Vodafone credit rating profile. Our capital allocation remains disciplined and focused on as we invest in our networks and put our Board in a position to maintain our consistent approach to the dividend. Financially, on a like-for like basis, 2018 was highlighted by a strong wireless service revenue and earnings growth. This is a testament to Verizon providing the best wireless experience on the nation's best network. Our bottom line performance was delivered through a combination of these revenue growth and our business excellence initiatives, which drove cash savings across the Company. We widened our network leadership position in 2018 and continued our momentum in delivering solid financial and operational performance. Our networks remain best-in-class and our performing better than ever, as evidenced by recent wins from J.D. Power and RootMetrics. We extended our leading wireless performance as we enhance our network and deliver the personalized experience for all our customers. 2018 was a year of 5G firsts. We were first to complete an overlay of data transmission on the 5G global standards. We were first to complete the first 5G data session on a smartphone. And in October, we proudly were the first in the world to commercially deploy 5G with our 5G Home product. As is seen in the year, our confidence is high as we\u2019re heading to the 5G era and the beginning of what many sees as the fourth industrial revolution. Operationally, we\u2019re now transitioning [ph] for Verizon 2.0, which is the realignment of our operations to better focus on our customers. This new operating model realigns our customer-facing units into consumer, business and Verizon Media Group. This will enable us to leverage our scale and infrastructure to create better solutions for our customers. We expect Verizon 2.0 will go live in the second quarter of 2019 and our results for the second quarter will be presented under the new structure. This transformation in how we face our customers is matched with the transformation under our business excellence initiatives where we recently announced our voluntary separation program and plans for our IT outsourcing. Together, these initiatives, along with our Verizon 2.0 operating model, position us to be even more competitive in a rapidly changing environment. Now, I'll hand over to Matt to talk about the financial and operating results of the businesses, starting with slide six. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Hans. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue as reported was $34.3 billion, an improvement of 1%; and for the full-year, 2018 revenue was a $130.9 billion. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, total revenue was $34.1 billion in 4Q, up 0.5%. For 2018, on a comparable basis, excluding impacts from revenue recognition, divestitures and partial year impacts from acquisitions in the media group, adjusted operating revenues grew approximately 2.2%. The primary driver of the increase was continued wireless service revenue growth driven by step ups in access and net account growth. In the fourth quarter, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, totaled approximately $11.0 billion, compared to $10.7 billion last year. For the full-year, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, totaled approximately $45.6 billion, an increase of 3.1%; and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.9%, slightly lower than last year's margin of 35.0%. Our business excellence initiatives produced cumulative cash savings of $2.3 billion in 2018. For the full-year, the mix of activity skewed more towards capital reductions than OpEx savings. The voluntary separation program gives us a good starting point for further benefits in 2019, and the program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the full-year period. Let's now turn to our cash flow results on slide seven. In 2018, Verizon significantly strengthened the balance sheet with strong cash flow while continuing to efficiently invest for sustained network leadership. Full-year cash flow from operations totaled $34.3 billion, up $10 billion year-over-year. Year-over-year improvements in cash flow from operations was driven by strong operating results, recurring and nonrecurring tax reform benefits, reduced headwinds from the wireless device payment model, as well as lower discretionary pension and benefit contributions. Full-year capital expenditures were $16.7 billion, in line with our revised guided range of 16.6 to $17.0 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $17.7 billion, up $10.6 billion year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $113.1 billion of total debt, comprised of $103.0 billion of unsecured debt and $10.1 billion of device payment securitizations. Our near term unsecured bond maturities are modest at $2.6 billion through year-end 2020. Total net debt was down $4.7 billion in 2018 and unsecured debt is lower by $5.2 billion. The reduction in unsecured debt and higher EBITDA were the primary drivers in improving our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio from 2.6 times at the end of 2017 to 2.3 times at the end of 2018. In addition, the balance sheet is stronger as a result of about $5.1 billion of discretionary employee benefits funding during the last two years. This was primarily related to our pension plans, raising the funded status from approximately 70% at year-end 2016 to about 91% at year-end 2018 on a GAAP basis. The strength in balance sheet provides us with a financial flexibility to grow the business. We expect excess cash flow remaining after investing into business and paying our dividend will be deployed in 2019 towards our balance sheet goals. Now, let's focus on the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide eight. Our customized experiences within our unlimited plans on the best wireless network have created a strong value proposition, and this is resonating with consumers. New customers are coming to Verizon at higher access points, and existing customers are stepping up in their plans. Additionally, we have seen our customers expand their accounts with more lines throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, total postpaid net adds were 1.2 million, up 3.9% including phone net adds of 653,000, which were up 51.5% over last year\u2019s strong results. In addition, we added 11,000 tablets and 556,000 other connected devices, predominantly wearables. Smartphone net adds were 873,000, up 34.9% compared to 647,000 last year. For the quarter, we increased customer accounts, adding 118,000 to our base. For the full-year, postpaid net additions of 2.5 million included 1.1 million phones, 1.6 million other connected devices, and 181,000 tablet losses. Our competitiveness in 2018 was highlighted by smartphone net adds of 2 million, up 13% versus the prior year. The overall experience of paring our unlimited plans with the best network continues to resonate with our customer base, resulting in outstanding retail postpaid churn of 1.08% and phone churn of 0.82% in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, postpaid device activations totaled 11.9 million, down from 12.4 million last year. About 81% of these activations were phones with wearables accounting for the majority of the other device activations. The reduction in activations was the net result of higher gross additions being more than offset by lower upgrades. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 6.3%, up sequentially as expected, but was lower compared to 7.2% for the same quarter last year. The elongation of the upgrade cycle continues as more customers hold on to their devices for a longer period. In the quarter, prepaid net losses were 90,000 compared to a net loss of 184,000 in the prior year. Our 4G smartphone prepaid base increased during the quarter and all of the decline in prepaid net additions was due to 3G and basic prepaid phones. We ended 2018 with 118 million total retail connections excluding wholesale and Internet of Things. Our industry-leading postpaid connections space grew 2.3% to $113.4 million and our prepaid connections totaled 4.6 million at the end of the year. Let's turn to slide nine and take a closer look at wireless profitability. Our wireless operating results provided the basis for growth and profitability in the fourth quarter. Total wireless operating revenue increased 2.1% to $24.3 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, operating revenue totaled $91.3 billion, an increase of 4.4%. For the quarter, wireless service revenue increased by 1.9%. For the full-year 2018, service revenue grew 1.7%, attributed to ongoing customer growth, step-ups to unlimited and the benefits of subscribers customizing their experience through mix-and-match plans. On a year-over-year basis, equipment revenue decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter due to lower upgrade volumes. For the full-year, equipment revenue increased 8.4%, driven by higher-priced handsets and increased sales of wearables. At the end of the quarter, approximately 48% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance. Our postpaid phone base on unsubsidized service pricing increased to about 84% at year-end versus 80% at the end of last year. The fourth quarter trends in service revenue, business efficiencies and upgrade volumes provided the basis to EBITDA margin to increase year-over-year to 40.5% compared to approximately 39.8% in the same period last year. In the fourth quarter, we generated $9.8 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 3.9%. For the full-year, we generated $40.9 billion of EBITDA, up by approximately $2.3 billion year-over-year. Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total operating revenue for the wireline segment decreased 3.5% in the quarter and 3.1% for the full-year. Growth from our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. For the full-year, consumer revenue decreased by 1.5%. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.0% in the quarter as Fios Internet growth was overshadowed by declines in video and legacy products. Fios revenue grew by 2.9% in the quarter. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher internet speeds. In the quarter, we added 54,000 Fios Internet customers. We now have a total of about 6.1 million Fios Internet subscribers. In Fios Video, the business faced ongoing headwinds as observed throughout the linear TV market. The Fios Video business ended with 46,000 subscriber losses in the quarter and 168,000 for the year. For the quarter, enterprise solutions revenue decreased 3.0%, partner solutions revenue decreased 9.2%, and business markets revenue was down 5.6%. Overall, secular and pricing pressures continued to be significant headwinds for these businesses. We expect legacy product revenues to continue to decline in 2019 at rates consistent with last year. In order to counter this decline, we continue to invest in fiber-based products and new applications that will open new opportunities for customers across our business lines. Through our One Fiber initiative we are building a single, highly-resilient and scalable fiber network that will allow us to efficiently provide advanced data services to customers across our consumer, business and enterprise customer groups. As a result, we remain confident that we can continue to generate growth and momentum in fiber-based products and new applications. Segment EBITDA margin was 16.9% for the quarter and 19.2% for the year, as our focus on operational efficiencies was more than offset by revenue declines and content cost escalations. Let's move on to slide 11 to discuss our media and IoT businesses. For the quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $2.1 billion, a decrease of approximately 5.8% year-over-year. As expected, revenue trends were up sequentially from 3Q, due to seasonal advertising spending. Year-over-year, we continue to see traction in growth in mobile usage. However, this is overshadowed by the macro pressures from declines in desktop volumes. From a technology standpoint, we have now completed our supply and demand side platform integrations. We are focused on technologies and resources in the business that will yield forward momentum. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $242 million. IoT revenues including Verizon Connect increased approximately 9.5% in the quarter. Our value proposition is evolving as our engagement with municipalities gains more momentum with the upcoming commercial rollout of 5G services. Let's move next to discuss 2019. Our focus on executing on the fundamentals of the business positions us for strong performance in the upcoming year. On a GAAP reported basis, we expect low single-digit percentage growth in full-year 2019 consolidated revenue, compared to the prior year, driven by the continuation of wireless service revenue growth. We expect to see organic earnings growth in 2019. However, our EPS will be impacted by the revenue recognition headwind we discussed earlier as well as a few nonoperational items, primarily a higher effective tax rate and increased interest expense due to placing additional spectrum into service. After the effect of these items, which we expect to be approximately $0.24 to $0.28 of pressure on EPS growth, we expect our adjusted EPS in 2019 to be approximately the same as our adjusted 2018 EPS, excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. At this point, we expect the adoption of the new lease accounting standard to have about $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter headwind impact on EPS in 2019. The 2019 effective tax rate is projected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. We expect cash income taxes to be $2 billion to $3 billion higher due to tax benefits that were realized in 2018 that we do not expect to repeat this year. Our internal capital decision process and return objectives have not changed. We are consistent and methodical in our allocation. We expect consolidated capital spending to be between 17 and $18 billion, including the expanded commercial launch of 5G. This capital intensity is consistent with historic levels. Let me now turn it back to Hans to walk through our strategic priorities for 2019.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Matt. Verizon\u2019s strategic priorities for 2019 all clear. I have outlined five priorities with my team that focus on our customers, financial performance, 5G leadership, our valued employees, and Verizon's role in creating benefits for our society. First, we will redouble our long-standing excellence in customer satisfaction. This customer centric mentality has always been one of our core assets and will become even more essential as innovation continues to accelerate. Second, we'll build on the momentum of our strong 2018 financial and operating results. Today, we're growing the business, strengthening the balance sheet, and improving the cost structure to compete in the environment. In the future, we will enable and monetize new use cases on our advanced networks. Our third priority is to extend our leadership in 5G. The cornerstone of our strategy continues to be our best-in-class network. We have demonstrated our network leadership through every cycle from analog to 4G. We run to and embrace the challenge of deploying the best technology for our customers. Whatever is technology such a small cells, dense fiber or LTE advanced features, Verizon has a proven track record of setting the gold standard for others to follow. In return, our consistent investment in our networks, particularly 5G will pay dividends as well as we advance and lead the industry into the fourth industrial revolution. Not too long ago, they mere thought of having a 5G network before the beginning of the next decade would have seen implausible, but we pushed the industry to get there faster. As a leader and catalyst of change, we advanced 5G development and delivered to the word the first two 5G deployments in 2018 with our initial four commercial markets, and this is real 5G. This is a completely transformative experience that gives customers speeds, measuring hundreds of megabits to gigabits, reduce latency, allow for connections per square kilometers by millions, and energy efficiency at a fraction of today's consumptions. Our 5G network is projected on delivering a game-changing wireless experience. The assets we have compiled and put into place in 2018 have enabled this vision. We have the spectrum to provide a rich ultra-wideband 5G services. Our deep fiber backbone connects our assets, enabling a high-capacity and efficient architecture. Our investment in the intelligent edge network creates new capabilities and gives us the flexibility to serve our customers. And it is our engineers and the know-how they've accumulated through this development process that binds our 5G solution together. No other wireless operator has this unique combination of assets. We are the leader in 5G as we have said before and proven once again. We don't wait for the future, we build it. Our fourth priority is our employees. Our winning team within new Verizon 2.0 will be the key to creating new solutions in today's world. We want to continue fostering [ph] organization environment that embraces change, sparks curiosity, and encourages strategic-risk taking while inspiring all of us. Internally, our shared purpose [ph] is to deliver the promise of the digital world by enabling people, businesses and society to innovate and drive positive change. Our fifth priority is carrying forward Verizon\u2019s commitment to responsible business practices and making the world a better place. At Verizon, we coined the word humanability, which means the power of technology to create new ability for humans to innovate and drive positive change in the work. I'm confident that Verizon\u2019s 5G network will be universal enabler of advanced use cases and technology that brings humanability forward. I\u2019m super excited to host our upcoming investor day on February 21st. We will bring the Verizon executive team and go deeper into our strategy, our vision of Verizon 2.0 and our enhanced customer focus. With that I will turn it back to Brady for the Q&A session.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Hans, I wonder if you could give us an update on 5G Home. When do you expect the standards-based gear to be available? And what does the CapEx guidance really imply in terms of homes passed this year and the progress towards the 30 million? And then, any commentary on the handset outlook for mobile 5G and what we should expect on that side this year?\nHans Vestberg: When it comes to the 5G Home, we are so thoughtfully deployed in the four cities that we decided for. So, what we\u2019re waiting for right now is the CP equipment for 5G Home. And as the industry is evolving, the first focus for the industry is actually to do chipset for smartphones and then secondarily the next generational chipset comes on the CPE side. We definitely believe that this year, we will get CPEs on the NR standard in the second half of 2019. So, that's where we are. We\u2019re building the network as we\u2019re speaking. And as soon as we see the availability of the CPEs, we will of course -- getting that out in the marketplace. And that of course subsequently answers the question on handset as well. We\u2019re going to see handsets coming out in the first half of 2019. As you know, we have announced two phones, one from Motorola and one from Samsung. The one from Samsung has not been seen yet but hopefully it will be seen soon. And as soon as those are ready, and we have been together sort of interoperability testing that, we\u2019re going to launch that. Remember now that the network is a multiuse network. So, the home and the mobility is the same network we\u2019re building. We\u2019re not building two different networks. So, it\u2019s more what type of devices you\u2019re connecting to the network. And then, ultimately, on the question on CapEx, I think Matt guided our CapEx, which has been consistent over the years. We are doing everything. Remember, the majority of investments in the 5G network is coming with the fiber networking we\u2019ve been doing, the passive asset we\u2019re doing, the intelligent edge network design that we\u2019ve been working on for years, and then, of course, you have the equipment coming at the end of it. So, we are actually -- been for several years investing into be prepared for the 5G, and this is including the CapEx guidance for this year for obvious reasons.\nOperator: The next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Maybe a couple of quick questions for Matt. On the wireless side, you saw ARPA decline a little bit in the fourth quarter versus the growth in the third quarter, and you saw decel in the service revenue growth. What's driving that decline that we saw this quarter? And, are the sort of benefits of moving to the unlimited sort of fully reflected in the decline we're seeing, and how do you expect that to turn going forward? And then, on the free cash flow, thanks for the CapEx and the taxes guidance. Any other sort of things you should be thinking about as we look to free cash flow in \u201819 from a pension contribution or working cap standpoint? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, John. So, on the wireless service revenue, I think, as you look at the fourth quarter number, what we have is, we continue to have good underlying momentum in the wireless service revenue, whether you're talking about the social service revenue line, or whether you're looking at the ARPU line. But, there is little bit of noise in the fourth quarter number that masks that growth. So, let me just give you a little more detail. In 4Q, both in \u201817 and \u201818, we had some nonrecurring items that gives us that 1.9% year-over-year increase, which as you say, slightly lower than the past two quarters but still certainly a good positive number. 4Q in \u201817, we had a positive adjustment related to our wholesale revenues, and that adjustment didn't repeat this year. So, we're lapping that adjustment. Additionally, this year, we had a couple of items go the other direction, including some service credits related to that we granted customers impacted by natural disasters. So, when you compare those, you remove those, the underlying core retail postpaid service revenue increased sequentially, had good momentum year-over-year, in line with what we saw in 2Q and 3Q. And importantly we start 2019 billing more accounts and at a higher ARPA than we started last year. So, it's a good place to be. I think, we continue to see opportunity to increase service revenue in 2019 by adding accounts as we did last year, but also increasing ARPA. There is still significant headroom for us to move customer to unlimited and step them up when they're in unlimited, adding more devices to accounts. So, I think the momentum we saw in \u201818 will certainly continue into \u201819 in a good way. On the free cash flow, so, we don't actually provide, as you know, a free cash flow guide for the year. We did talk about the fact cash taxes will be higher. As I think about cash flow for 2019, there's five major items I would think about, a couple of them in the positive direction. We certainly expect the core EBITDA of the business to increase year-over-year. Additionally, last year, we had $1.7 billion of pension and benefits contribution, so we would not expect to be at the same level in 2019. And the other direction I mentioned in the prepared comments, the higher cash taxes, will also have the payments related to the voluntary severance program; all of those cash outflow will be in 2019. And we do expect CapEx to be higher part slightly year-over-year too. So, when you net those items together, you can kind of get to a view for 2019 cash flow. But certainly cash flow in 2018, very strong, $34 billion, up $10 billion year-over-year. We're proud of the progress we made there and will certainly look to build on that in 2019.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will come from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan. You may go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. Two if I can. How should we think about wireless EBITDA in 2019, given your continued cost focus, and the comment that 2018 cost savings were more focused on CapEx than OpEx? And second, on the balance sheet, I wouldn't let you get away without talking about leverage, 2.3 times today and headed lower. Can you think a little bit for us about priorities for cash flow from here? Do you see buying assets like spectrum or fiber that could lever your back up or should we start thinking about capital return in the next couple of years? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: I'll start with the second one down on the balance sheet. So, you say good progress on the leverage ratio on a net debt-to-EBITDA from 2.6 to 2.3 during the year. As I think about hitting into 2019, our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. We'll continue to be disciplined in how we deploy capital. Our number one priority is investing in the business, whether that be CapEx or whether that be other ways we can invest in the business. After that, we certainly -- the dividend continues to be very important to our shareholders. And then as we said, we continue to strengthen the balance sheet. In addition to the reduction in the leverage ratio, I\u2019d also point out, in the past couple of years, we've made approximately $5 billion contributions to our pension and benefit plans. And so, our funded status on our pension plans in the last couple of years has gone up from approximately 70% to 90%. So, some really good progress there. We'll see how the year plays out. We certainly expect to continue to improve, strengthen the balance sheet. And we'll also look for opportunities to grow the business. And if there is still cash left over, we\u2019ll decide what to do at that point in time. In terms of the wireless EBITDA in 2019, look, I'll start at the top of the income statement, and we expect service revenue to continue to grow. So, that's the tailwind that we have coming out of 2018 and will build on as we get into next year. So, we'll have some growth there. And then, as we continue to focus on the cost side of the business, obviously, we've got 10,000 people leaving the business over the course of the next few months that will have a positive impact on the EBITDA. And we continue to look for other ways to continuously make our business more efficient and competitive. So, I think you should see some good EBITDA trajectory as we go through 2019 and that will help contribute to the cash flow, as we talked about.\nHans Vestberg: And I can only add that on the question about CapEx and OpEx and in \u201818, we had more cash savings on the CapEx. We will continue with our disciplined way of the business excellence program, both on CapEx and OpEx. And I think that in \u201818 we show that we did everything we wanted to do on CapEx. At the same time, we actually became more efficient. And I think, the program we have put in place is very rigorous and very good. And that brings us all are benefits that we need to get from the investments at the same time as we\u2019re getting the efficiency. So, that's very much part of it, but we also look very much for the top-line, as Matt talked about. I think, it's a combination with the new leadership team coming into the second quarter, I think we want to have a great focus on it.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: If you don't mind, I was hoping maybe you clarify some of the comments you made around the EPS guidance and some of the drivers. So, you're basically saying that you expect earnings exclusive of the new lease accounting to be similar or effectively flat this year. And I think you indicated that there's essentially about a $0.14 headwind from the ASC 606, you had $0.28 benefit in \u201818. I think that goes to about 14 this year. And I just wanted to clarify. I think you also indicated, there's another say $0.10 to $0.14 coming out of the higher tax rate and the increase in interest expense because of putting spectrum into service. So, all in, those items are $0.24 to $0.28. Is that the point you made?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Good morning, Brett. Exactly. So, yes, you heard the guide right. On a GAAP basis, prior to the lease accounting, roughly similar. And you're right, within there, and we\u2019ve talked about this I think on the third quarter call, you have these headwinds from 606, and that's $0.28 of the benefit in 2018. We said roughly half going the other way in \u201819. So, you're right. That's around $0.14, and then, a couple of other items below the line that we talked about in the prepared comments. So, as we deploy the AWS-3, we\u2019re capitalizing less of our interest expense. So, that creates a year-over-year headwind; that doesn't change the cash flows of the business one bit. And then, on the ETR, we have the same guided range this year as last year, 24% to 26%. Last year, we ended up with 24.2%. We had a number of nonrecurring items that had us at that lower end of the range. Going into the year, we don't necessarily have line of sight, the same amount of the nonrecurring items this year. So, at this point, we\u2019re planning on being closer to the middle point of that range, and we will see how that plays out. But, as you say, when you add those up, you\u2019ve got about $0.24 to $0.28 of headwinds. And so, that means you have operational year-over-year improvement of a similar amount that get you to that guide. So, I think what you see over the past couple of year here, Brett, is certainly in \u201816 and \u201817, we had a business that was pretty flat to the revenue and earnings line. And then in \u201818, when you adjust that for the impact of tax reform and 606, we had 3.5% increase in EPS, and that was even with some headwinds in there from the share count dilution from Straight Path and couple of other items. So, good EPS growth in the core business in \u201818, and then you see us building on that in \u201819. And we tried to provide a little more color commentary in the prepared remarks, so you get the flavor of it and get some of the puts and takes to get us to the overall guide. But certainly, it\u2019s based off of the core underlying business continuing to grow year-over-year.\nBrett Feldman: And if you don\u2019t mind, just a quick follow-up. You walked through the wireless components that are driving that core growth. What have you assumed for -- in your outlook for 2019 for Verizon Media services? I believe it was dilutive to earnings in \u201818, what are you assuming that impact will be this year?\nMatt Ellis: So, Verizon Media Group, certainly, we talked a lot about in the second half of last year. We didn't provide a breakout of the earnings, not going to now. But certainly, when you saw a negative 6.9% revenue growth in 3Q and negative 5.8% in 4Q, it wasn't as much of a contributor to earnings, as we would've liked it have been last year. The assumption, as we head into this year's is they will make progress on the revenue line. And as they make progress on improving that revenue trajectory, it certainly will have a -- will change the earnings side as well. So, we think that they\u2019ve got some good plans in the business, we now need to execute against those, get the revenue trajectory turned around, and that will then impact earnings in a positive way as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nDavid Barden: I guess, a couple for Matt. You are focusing on the wireline side, Matt, kind of pros and cons we saw, little bit of an uptick in enterprise; we saw a big step down in wholesale; and margins really kind of came off in that division. And I'm wondering if that's going to be kind of a focus for the voluntary separation program that you've undertaken, and that's where you are going to see some of that. So, if you could kind of walk us through the drivers on the wireline side. The second question is just for the sake of thinking about 2019, where are we going to see the IFRS 16 lease accounting changes kind of have an effect on the -- on the business on the income statement would be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, David. So, on the wireline side -- and I'll ask Hans to add a couple of comments as well around it. But certainly, the ongoing secular decline in some of the legacy technologies, that continues. What's encouraging in the business is as we build out our fiber assets and the opportunities that creates there, some of the incremental technologies we're deploying in the area, like SD WAN, we're seeing some good progress to offset those secular declines. So, we will continue with that. And then, as you rightly say, as you think about the margins, as you head into \u201819, wireline will see a good part of the benefit from the voluntary severance program. So, that in addition to the other ongoing cost actions that we continue to take, should be of assistance to the wireline margins in \u201819.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. And if we look at the whole wireline team, as you rightfully pointed out, we have a secular decline in certain areas there. But to be honest, we also see with the assets we're now bringing out with intelligence edge network, we see possibility for many new solutions, sort of coming out of our customers based on the fiber we're deploying, but also when it comes to SD WAN and a couple of other very important solutions that are bringing out. At the same time, the small and medium business segment is very important for the U.S. economy where we are well-positioned. The wholesale has of course come down a little bit. But remember, now, we are deploying more infrastructure than ever before. So, I think that over time, but it will take some time, we'll definitely see even more possibility there. We have a very focus on that team to actually break the trend. We have now been coming down for -- when it comes to growth, I think the team is really focused on getting new products out. And we have a really good customer base to hold the wireline business. And as we move into the second quarter and our customer centric organization, it will even be more important with these customers that we can orchestrate with all our product portfolio from wireline, wireless, the IoT business et cetera. So I think we're really focused on coming back to growth. At the same time, you see that we're taking out costs. So, we see that we're managing that. So, again, we have a surgical focus on actually top-line, but at the same time seeing that we are managing our cost basis at the same time. And I think that Matt and the team are on to that operation all the time and we will continue so in 2019.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. On the lease accounting, David. So, couple of different things. On the income statement, as you heard upfront, we expect $0.01 to $0.02 of headwind per quarter. That's going to come mostly above the line. There may be some initial adjustments that will hit below the line but mostly above the line. If you think about it, there are some costs upfront costs associated with leases that we historically would've capitalized under the old rules that we won't necessarily be able to capitalize all those rules -- all of those upfront costs under the new rules. So, that's where you'll see some of the change come through. From a balance sheet standpoint, we will be grossing up both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet. At this point, we expect in the $21 billion to $23 billion range. So, that's the impact, you should see come through in the first quarter of 2019 from adopting that new standard.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: I wonder if we could just stay with the discussion of wireline for a second. Matt, when you were talking in your prepared remarks, you talked about pressure from programming costs. I wonder, if you could just think about kind of the Fios Video business for a moment. It seems like you've been hitting on some of the same themes for a while now, and that it may be right for sort of reimagining what you do with that business. Can you just talk about your strategic thinking about how long does it make sense to stay committed to a linear video product for Fios versus sort of repositioning it along with your 5G product as really almost a pure connectivity service, focused on broadband?\nMatt Ellis: So, as you say, a number of the trends we've seen in wireline have been ongoing for a number of years, including the increasing content costs. So, we continue to look for creating different options for customers that make sense for the price points you can then put in front of customers. And so -- but we don't expect the trajectory of content costs to change significantly over the next few years, unless we take some actions. And if we have the opportunity to provide customers with different ways of getting to the video content they want, we will certainly be excited about doing that. So, ever since we did choice TV, about four years ago now, we've been looking ways to get customers better choice around the cost of getting their video product, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\nHans Vestberg: And I agree with Matt here. We will of course over time see that we can create optionality for our customers to choose between different solutions for their TV viewing. So, we will have that definitely in our pocket. Initially, of course 5G Home has been focused on other cities than our footprint for Fios. But ultimately, we need to see that our customers have all the choices when it comes to how they want to consume the video. We see the trends in the market. And as Matt said, we're working hard with our cost in Fios all the way from content to other cost elements and see that we're managing that well. But ultimately, we need to create optionality for our customers. That's what Verizon always has done and that we\u2019ll continue to do.\nCraig Moffett: I guess, if I just -- if I were going to paraphrase, it sounds like you still believe the linear video product is still helpful in your ability to market Fios Broadband, and the Fios Broadband is not more competitive on its own as a broadband only product?\nHans Vestberg: No. I think that first of all, there we\u2019re going to manage our customers and see that they are getting what they want, and we're going to follow the market very closely. But, we still have plenty of customers using our Fios business on the linear TV and we will continue to serve them if they think that's important. But at the same time, we\u2019re going to create optionality; and that's the way old the job that we have as a tech innovator to constantly innovate and bring new solutions to our customers as the markets are evolving. So, we're going to see that the ones having Fios getting that; we have upgraded our Fios technology during 2018 and 2017 after a while of holding back a little bit. You'll see that the ones that our customers that feel that is good service, they are getting more of the service as well. So, we will continue with that but at the same time, create optionality over time. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Just a couple if I could. First, going back to the comments for expanded commercial launch of 5G in 2019. Can you frame how much of the country Verizon will cover for mobile 5G by the end of \u201819 and maybe also by the end of 2020? And then, secondly can you quantify the specific potential earnings benefit from the voluntary separation program, once it fully rolls through the financials?\nHans Vestberg: If I start with the 5G, we have not disclosed where we are on the deployment. I can say, we\u2019re deploying as fast as we can. And much of the work that we've been doing last couple of years is of course to prepare everything from the fiber to the agreement with the cities to getting the intelligent management network from the transport network, core network all out to the access. As the industry matures, the equipment is maturing for NRs, [ph] so we can bring that in. And we actually have quite a lot of deployment already of those types already base stations. So, we will come back to that when we commercially launch that, what we have noted. It\u2019s nothing we want to disclose for competitive reasons. So, I wouldn\u2019t talk about it right now. But, I think what is important to understand this lead that Verizon has on 5G. We have been on to this for several years, including the millimeter wave where we already have commercial service, where we of course not only understand the engineering of the 5G technology and the spectrum, it\u2019s also all the way from operations, marketing, installations all of that. And that is extremely valuable insight when we want to go fast as soon as we see that we have all the pieces that is needed for launching 5G Home or 5G mobility with ecosystem there and all of that. So, again, we have triggered the industry to be probably one and half to two years ahead of the schedule of 5G. We think that is enormously important for Verizon to be on the forefront of innovation. And we want to push that and said, we\u2019re nothing holding back coming out to 5G; it\u2019s more that we just need to see that the ecosystem is equally ready as Verizon is right now.\nMatt Ellis: Hey, Mike. On the voluntary benefits, as we announced, 10,000 people coming off payroll in terms of the benefit this year, they come off in predominantly three different waves. Some came off at year-end and we\u2019ve got a couple of additional waves coming off, so that factors in. We will have a small amount of backfills, not exactly the same position but as we re-imagine the work, but net, net a significant -- down the vast majority of that 10,000. So, the timing at which people come out will matter. Remember, the charge we took was $1.8 billion. We haven't disclosed what we expect the income statement benefit in 2019 will be. But certainly, we expect to get a good payback on that initial cost of doing the severance. So, you should expect a pretty significant benefit in 2019. And as we continue to change the way the work gets done, those heads don\u2019t come back into the business and that should be a sustainable cost improvement as we go forward.\nHans Vestberg: And I just want to put it in context, and remember, we started with a large transformation in the network and by that a lot of new ways of working. Then secondly, on top of that, we also define a new way of working with our IT where we have a fairly large outsourcing ongoing; at the same time, we have the voluntary program. All in all, it's our way to prepare ourselves for the future to be even more efficient, so we can be even more agile in the future. And you saw also lot weak, I guess. We announced also that we're doing a work in the Verizon Media Group where we are reducing. And all in all, it's part of a large transformation for us to prepare, doing that when we are as strong as we are right now. So, we\u2019re actually coming out there when the competitive landscape continues to be around and what's happening, we want to be agile and much more quick on own investments et cetera. So, I think, it's a larger transformation, the third part of that transformation of course, the Verizon 2.0 that we are implementing in the second quarter in order to have much more customer centric solutions for our customers. And that's based on our assets, when it comes to the network or brand and our distribution and seeing that work excelling in this marketplace. So, that is -- you need to put that all in a context when you think about what we're doing right now. And I think I've been here now for quite a while, I see the response of the organization be very positive to all these changes to see that we continue to be the leader in these markets.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for getting me in, just two brief ones if I could. First, have you seen any signs of impact in the business from either a small and macro backdrop or the government shutdown earlier this month that we should consider? And then secondly on a wireless competitive landscape, can you just talk about what you saw in the marketplace in 4Q, and whether anything is really changed materially thus far in January? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Hey, Matt. So, on your first question, no major impact at this point on the macro economy or even the shutdown. On the shutdown, we did see some impact in our government business, as you'd expect, but nothing significant to the overall business. And then, in the wireless market, we see a continuation of the trends that we saw in 2018. The vast majority of promotions now are more on the handset side, the hardware as opposed on the service revenue. We continue to see that promotional activity in the marketplace, but we continue to believe that -- and see the evidence with the great network experience and having the right offers where we compete effectively. And I would reiterate what we said earlier, when you talk about that best network experience, when you look at a number of the third-party surveys that came out for the second half of 2018 performance, not only did our performance improve but we widened the lead against the competition. So, that continues to matter to our customers and puts us in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike McCormack: Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe just circling back on the wireline side. The enterprise decline seem to be a little bit more muted this quarter. Was there some sort of CP benefit that you got or anything else going on, on the enterprise side? And then, secondly on the competitive front, I guess both in wireless and wireline, any change from the recent launches in cable? I know we have charter launching wireless; and then on the broadband side, obviously rolling gigabit services across the footprint, any change that you\u2019ve seen across both of those segments? \nHans Vestberg: On the enterprise decline, there was nothing special from the -- it was a normal mix, and of course we had some good wins in the quarter, but there was nothing, so no CPE that was taking out. On the MVNO, and I can only comment that we're happy with the agreements we have. And for us, with the technology and the network we have, I mean, it makes sense to work with the MVNOs. And I think that we are very happy with the setup that we have with the two cable guys right now in the market. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: No. Exactly, I think the -- nothing we saw changed significantly in the fourth quarter from the trends we discussed previously in here in terms of the makeup of competitors in the marketplace. And look, as the supposed gig footprints expand, it doesn't seem to be impacting our competitiveness at all. So, we continue to believe, by having the best product out there is resonating with customers. And we welcome other guys into the market and look forward to competing with them.\nBrady Connor: This is all the time we have for questions today. Before the end of the call, I want to turn it back over to Hans for a few closing comments.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brad. And just to summarize up a little bit what we\u2019ve been discussing. I mean, first of all, we had the strong financial operating performance in the fourth quarter, but not only that, the hold 2018. I think, the wireless team has built a momentum, all the way from unlimited launch. I have to say, I'm proud of the team, they continuously innovate. And as Matt has said several times on this call, that give us a very good start for 2019 what they have been doing so far this year. So, we are coming in with -- in 2019 with good momentum, both from a business point of view but also our business excellence work we continue doing and we're in the start of it. And I think that both Matt and I, we would do it in the best way in the courses way, but also prepare ourselves for the future to be even strong Company. I outlined my five key priorities, you heard them, and I think that they should be resonated with all of you, both from the growth point of view, implementing the new structure, the 5G, and of course, our asset and our employees, and continue also to see that our brand evolves and that we're doing the right things for our society. I think that goes for any company in today's world where employees, customers and shareholders expecting it from you. And I think that's our normal strategy. So, it's nothing new, but it's more that we need to continue to leverage that in our humanability. We will continue to focus on innovation and our network. There's no debate that that is extremely important to us. And I'm proud of what the team did in the engineering, in the network, on the 4G network. It continues to lead and extend the leadership, which I think is a great contribution to the skills that we have in our technology group. And that, of course, continue in the 5G, which we have already our 5G Home commercial. We're going to see much more of 5G commercial, both mobility and home during 2019. And I hope that you\u2019re equally excited as I am. And I hope that you will join us for the Investor Day in February. We're going to bring the executive team there; you\u2019re going to meet the new leaders. We want to go a little bit deeper on the things we're discussing today in the structure what we're doing and of course, we want to talk about 5G. So with that, thank you for your time today and great that you\u2019re listening. Thank you very much.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-10-23 15:10:50", "content": "Executives: Brady Connor - SVP, IR Matthew Ellis - EVP and CFO\nAnalysts: Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley David Barden - Bank of America Philip Cusick - JPMorgan John Hodulik - UBS Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson Michael Rollins - Citi Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Jeff Kvaal - Nomura Instinet Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Partners Walter Piecyk - BTIG Matt Niknam - Deutsche Bank\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of $1.19 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to walk you through. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of $159 million primarily associated with the early debt redemption costs of $476 million; acquisition and integration-related charges of $137 million primarily pertaining to Oath; and a pension and benefit remeasurement credit of $454 million. The net impact after tax was approximately $120 million or $0.03 per share resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $1.22. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter up 3.1% compared to $0.98 a year ago. It has been three quarters since the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The effect of this change is illustrated within the table on slide 4. As a reminder, it results in a reduction of wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent during all three quarters of 2018 with a $0.06 per share impact in the third quarter. We continue to expect the accretive benefit to full year earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenues and commission costs converge. This will create year-over-year EPS pressure in both 2019 and 2020. For the remainder of this call, unless otherwise noted financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to take you through the results for the quarter.\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Brady, and welcome everyone to the first earnings call in the 5G era. Installations of 5Gs Home by Verizon, the world's first ever 5G commercial product, began earlier this month continuing our proud history of driving innovation. It is just the first service of many to come on this new and exciting technology. In the third quarter, we continued our strong operational and financial performance by executing on the fundamentals with laser focus while retaining and expanding our high-value customer relationships. Our methodical and disciplined capital allocation model affords us the flexibility to compete and win in the marketplace while investing in our best-in-class networks, strengthening the balance sheet, and returning value to shareholders. Also, during the quarter, our Board approved the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. Critical to our ongoing profitability is the work we are doing across our business excellence initiatives that are transforming all parts of our Company. In 2018, this has included adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the network restructuring began last year, and more recently evolving our IT strategy and the announcement of the voluntary separation program. These initiatives are focused on positioning us to meet the rapidly evolving demands from our customers for years to come in a competitive environment. Let's move next to slide 6 to discuss our network and technology. During the quarter, we extended our leadership position, delivering the best network performance and overall experience to our valued customers. We won more J.D. Power awards than any other wireless provider for a record 21st time in a row and ranked highest in wireless network performance in all six regions of the U.S. In the most recent Nielsen report on streaming data quality, our reliable network ranks highest in video success ratings. And finally, we continue to extend our RootMetrics leadership position obtaining the highest percentage of wins nationally. While we are excited to be at the dawn of the 5G era, our 4G LTE network will continue to be a foundation of our services for many years to come. We continue to make enhancements to our 4G network through fiber and small cell densification as well as the deployment of new technologies to provide additional functionality and quality. 5G technology will provide meaningful value above the current network experience. At Verizon, we believe that true 5G requires an ultra-wideband solution, utilizing millimeterwave spectrum to address the full array of use cases that 5G enables. Our network preparation for nationwide 5G deployment requires deep fiber resources, a vast array of small cells, critical spectrum holdings and mobile edge computing capabilities. All of which we have been assembling for years. 5G Home by Verizon continues our legacy of consumer firsts. We are now providing wireless broadband service using millimeter wave spectrum. This revolutionary product offers customers a wireless in-home Internet experience with speeds and capacity that rival leading wide broadband products available today. The initial launch of 5G Home on proprietary standards in four markets positions us for a larger rollout in 2019. We are gaining valuable insights ahead of the industry that will drive refinements to the customer experience prior to the arrival of global standards-based equipment. We have said all along that we intend to be first not only in launching the world's initial 5G commercial product but also the first to deliver true 5G mobility to consumers. During the quarter, we completed the world's first end-to-end global standards compliant call with a smartphone test device using our network facilities in Minneapolis. As soon as devices and equipment are available the deployment of our 5G network on the global standard will begin for mobility and residential broadband in the new 5G ultra-wideband era. Let's turn to slide 7 and take a closer look at consolidated financial highlights of the quarter. On a reported basis third-quarter consolidated revenue was $32.6 billion up 2.8%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard total revenue was $32.5 billion up 2.6%. The primary driver of the increase was improved wireless service revenue due to customer step-ups to higher access plans and an increase in the average connections per account. On a consolidated basis excluding special items third-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% which was up from prior year's margin of 36.0%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 billion or 3.4% due primarily to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business. Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash savings of $1.3 billion year-to-date, from a mix of capital and operational expenditure activities. The program remains on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative savings for the four-year period. Let's now focus on cash flow results on slide 8. During the third quarter we continue to drive strong cash generation. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $26.2 billion an increase of $9.8 billion from the prior year. This was driven by strong operating results supplemented by the benefits from tax reform and the completion of the transition of device payment plan securitization to on-balance sheet financing. Year-to-date capital spending of $12.0 billion supported the increased demand on our industry-leading 4G network, the launch of 5G Home, earlier this month, significant fiber deployment in markets nationwide and pre-positioning for additional 5G services. We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be between $16.6 billion and $17.0 billion. This reflects the benefits from our business excellence program which has allowed us to make all of the planned investments while aggressively advancing the 5G ecosystem and transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network. This architecture will provide both CapEx and OpEx efficiencies compared to the networks of the past. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $14.2 billion year-to-date. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels which give us confidence to operate through different financial market environments. We ended the quarter with $112.9 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $103.7 billion of unsecured debt and $9.2 billion of on-balance sheet securitizations. We have made good progress this year towards our goal of strengthening the balance sheet. Operational cash flows and the benefits from tax reform have resulted in a decrease in our total debt of $4.2 billion year-to-date while allowing us to make discretionary contributions of $1.7 billion to employee benefit programs. This has driven a change in the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA from 2.6 times to 2.4 times since the beginning of the year. Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on slide 9. Total wireless operating revenue increased 6.1% to $22.9 billion in the third quarter primarily driven by strong trends in service and equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increased by 2.6% driven primarily by customer step-ups to higher price plans and an increase in average connections per account. Our mix and match unlimited offering provides customization options to suit the individual needs of our customers while providing a superior network experience. In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 13.7% on a year-over-year basis driven by higher-priced handsets and increased sales of wearables. Our postpaid customer migration to unsubsidized pricing has stabilized to 83% of our phone base. Comparatively, the same quarter in the prior year was 78%. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter consistent with the prior year. The combination of service revenue growth and efficiencies gained within the business have led to segment EBITDA growth of $664 million, an increase of 6.7% year-over-year. For the quarter wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.4%. Let's now turn to slide 10 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. In the third quarter, wireless operational performance sustained momentum from the previous quarters by expanding our relationships and subscriber experience with postpaid customers. Total net phone editions were 295,000 compared to 275,000 last year including postpaid smartphone net addition of 510,000. Postpaid net ads totaled 515,000 including tablet net losses of 80,000 and other connected device gains of 300,000 led by wearables.\\ Our postpaid phone churn of 0.80% is a result of our network quality and reliability coupled with the diversification and personalization of our unlimited offerings. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.04% was up compared to 0.97% in the prior year. We expect postpaid phone churn to increase seasonally through the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. Total postpaid device activations of which approximately 80% were phones were down 1.4%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0% down from 5.5% in the prior year. In the third quarter, prepaid net additions declined by 96,000 compared to an increase of 139,000 in the prior year. Within this we had smartphone net additions of 15,000. The change in the size of our overall prepaid base reflects our ongoing activity to focus our prepaid offerings on value-added segments. Now, let's move to our wireline segment on slide 11. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.7% in the quarter as growth in our high-quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by technology shifts and ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.8% driven by legacy core declines and cord cutting partially offset by Fios broadband growth. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.1% due primarily to our broadband offerings. Fios broadband Internet experienced growth of 54,000 customers due to demand for high-quality Internet connectivity. Fios video results continue to be impacted by ongoing shifts away from linear video offerings with losses of 63,000 in the quarter. Our Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets revenues declined by 4.0%, 6.3% and 7.0% respectively. Enterprise Solutions revenues declined by 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Results in each of these businesses reflect the pressures on legacy products and price compression, which at this time continue to offset the growth in fiber-based products. Segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.9%. We expect price compression on legacy products, secular trends and increasing content costs to continue to put pressure on the wireline margins. Let's now move on to slide 12 to discuss our media and IoT businesses. For third quarter, Oath revenue was $1.8 billion, which was 6.9% below the same quarter last year. We are seeing revenue pressure from search and desktop usage, which is more than offsetting positive growth in mobile usage and video products, including our distribution partnership with the NFL. Because search and desktop products make up the majority of the Oath business and we believe pressure in those sectors is likely to continue, we do not expect to meet our previous target of $10 billion of revenue by 2020. The leadership team at Oath is focused on returning to revenue growth by completing the integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo! advertising platforms by year-end, implementing initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets and building services around our core content pillars of sports, news, finance and entertainment. Additionally, we are utilizing Oath's technical capabilities such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality across all of Verizon. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue including Verizon Connect was up approximately 12% year-over-year. Let's now move to slide 13 to summarize our third quarter results. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance, while building momentum for our ultra-wideband 5G network. Our launch of the world's first commercial 5G product signals the beginning of an era that will transform the way people live and work. Our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network enabling efficiencies throughout the core infrastructure and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the edge of the network. We are excited about our current positioning in the marketplace our financial strength and the opportunities ahead of us. With that I will turn the call back to Brady, so we can get to your questions.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks and two if you don't mind. I just want to come back to CapEx and the lower outlook there, it sounds like you are certainly enjoying some efficiencies as a result of your cost savings program. I am wondering if there are any timing considerations. So for example are we in maybe a little bit of an air pocket as you ramp down the 4G spend but you haven't quite hit run rate on 5G? And then on ARPA you continue to see some strength there. I was hoping you could deconstruct that a little bit. How much of it is strong product level ARPU trends particularly in phones as people take unlimited? And to what extent is it being driven as more devices are attached to accounts? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks Brad. Good morning. So on CapEx you certainly see the benefit of our operational excellence activities we have been doing throughout the year. This really started a year ago when we reorganized the network organization and we are seeing the benefits of some changes and how we run that organization using new capacity utilization models, changes to our inventory management systems, adoption of procurement analytical tools and a whole host of other things. So this is activity that began last year. It is showing up this year. I will tell you we are getting everything done that we wanted to get done in 2018. We are just doing it more efficiently than we initially originally expected to. And I don't see - you used the word air pockets. I don't see an air pocket here. We have been pre-positioning the network for the transition from 4G to 5G for a number of years now. So we will get into obviously our views on 2019 and beyond when we talk again in January. But we've got everything done this year we expected to. And the team has done a great job of just doing it more efficiently so that will open up more opportunities for us as we go forward. On the ARPA side as you mentioned we've certainly seen some good increase this year and it's been largely coming from step-ups. We have been seeing an increase in connections per account. But as we get customers onto unlimited and they see the quality of the experience there and then they step up from one plan to another plan we have been seeing some good overall results in ARPA. I will tell you there is still a good amount of runway there as well. So excited with the momentum that we have in wireless at the moment and I think there is still some way to go with it.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMatthew Ellis: Brady, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt. you talked about 5G quite a bit. I don't know if there is any early commentary that you can give us on the launches and what you are seeing so far. And then as we think about next year and I think you said you would accelerate that. What is the timeline looking at like in terms of getting the standards-based gear and in particular a path to having a self-installed solution for 5G Home? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Simon. So, yeah, as you say we're excited that we are now in the 5G era. I will add that we started doing installs earlier this month. And we've seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs. The technology works, our customers are getting the experience they expected and we are getting a lot of good learning which will benefit us next year when we roll-out the product to that much larger audience. 5G Home will become more significant as we expand coverage and we get on the global standards equipment in 2019. And I would expect that that would start to have an impact on consolidated revenues as we get into 2020 and beyond. And you mentioned self-installs. A big part of what we are learning in these four markets is that install process. So when we get to rolling out across a broader geography on the global standard next year, we will just have a level of learning about the customer experience that will differentiate us from everyone else.\nSimon Flannery: Okay. So is that sort of mid-2019 that we start to see this gear coming on in scale?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, we are really dependent on the industry to develop it. We will be ready to deploy both on the network side and the customer side when the equipment is ready whether that be from the network OEMs or the customer equipment manufacturers. So sometime in 2019, we will push the industry to get there as quickly as possible and we will see how soon that happens.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Matt, could you kind of elaborate a little on the voluntary separation program. You know what the goal is? What the timetable is and what the margin impact is expected to be? And where we see that across the wireline and wireless organizations? And then the second question is with respect to delevering you've had good success there on the back of the cash flow windfall from tax reform and operations. With looking down the pike we've got C-band spectrum potentially coming to market, millimeter wave spectrum coming to market. What are the limits and the parameters around the balance sheet that inform what you are willing to do on the spectrum from so that we can kind of anticipate where the balance sheet looks like in the next 12 months? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, David. So on the voluntary separation program the way that I would suggest you think about it is - it's part of our overall business excellence initiative whether that be the adoption of the zero-based budgeting methodology, some of the other things that we have done. Really what we are looking at is while we are certainly glad to see the financial performance we have today and made good progress there what Hans and I are focused on is making sure that we are not just successful today but we can be successful into the future as well. And that we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along in the marketplace. So what this really is about is saying do we have the - if you were setting up our business from scratch today would you set it up the way it is? And there are significant process improvements that we have around us. And so the voluntary separation program is part of continuing to evolve and transform the way we do business to continue to improve the efficiencies across the business and we will be driving those changes over the course of the next 12 months. In terms of the size of the impact of it - it is too soon to tell. We are in the middle of the period where employees can choose to accept the offer. So in terms of the size of the initial charge that will come through in fourth quarter or the size of the benefits that we will start to get in 2019 it is too soon to say. When we have information on that we will certainly look to share it with everyone. But this is just part of the continued drive to transform the business, to make sure that we are successful in the long run and have the right cost base to be able to compete irrespective of how the industry develops. On the balance sheet, certainly glad to see the progress we've made this year. Strong cash flow certainly helped by tax reform, but also the operation of the business driving a lot of that benefit. So, you have seen the leverage come down from 2.6 times at the start of the year to 2.4 times now, and so glad to see that progress there. I'm not going to get into specifics about parameters about what we may or may not do around any type of acquisition whether that be spectrum or anything else. The key for us is making sure that we have a balance sheet that gives us the flexible structure to take advantage of whatever comes up. So if you kind of think across those two questions you had, we'll make sure we got the cost structure that we can take advantage of opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. And then we've got the balance sheet flexibility to make sure we can take advantage of any opportunities that come along. So we can be very adaptable no matter how the industry develops going forward and the opportunities that come up.\nDavid Barden: Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, Matt. Thanks. First, wireline margins were pretty stable, but you talked about continued pressure. How do you think about that from here? Is your comment of about 20% from the last call still a good level or should we expect some degradation? And then second, you called out a $0.27 to $0.31 tailwind from ASC 606 this year, and that that will fade to essentially zero in the next two years. As we think about the underlying growth in revenue and EBITDA driving earnings, do you think we can expect the Company to grow reported earnings in 2019 and 2020? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Phil. So, on wireline, yes, certainly expect to see the margins over the near term to be in that range we discussed on the last call around that 20% level. Would be a little above, a little below depending on the quarter. But certainly with the revenue trajectory in that business that will provide some pressure on that margin. So we are focused on continuing to address both the revenue trajectory and the cost side of the wireline business, but that's something we've been doing for a while and we'll keep working on it. As you talk about the impact of 606, and yeah, we still see about $0.27 to $0.31 of GAAP benefit this year. But when you back that out 3.1% EPS growth on an adjusted basis year-over-year and that's certainly what we are focused on doing. So as you think about next year, you really have to take this year's number back out the $0.27 to $0.31, put a growth rate on and then put around half-ish or so of this year's benefit in next year. And that will get you in around the right ballpark. But, net-net we are certainly focused on getting - showing growth at the EPS level and at the top line. But we just obviously got some noise from the accounting as we go over the next couple of years, and 606 flows its way all the way through our financials both for the current year and the prior year we are comparing to.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Two if I could. You have some commentary in there on the revenue growth or declines at Oath. Any commentary on the losses we got, have you in there for about less than $1 billion this year? Does the sort of I guess change in approach to Oath mean that you could find some cost savings there as well and maybe get that business closer to profitability as we look out to 2019 and 2020? And then more broadly on the 5G rollout the FCC passed some small cells citing reform. Does that change the sort of internal targets you have for the rollout of the small cell and 5G infrastructure and possibly allow you to go a little faster as you look out to 2019 and 2020? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks John. Yeah on the 5G rollout certainly we were glad to see the FCC rules around the small cell adoption, doesn't necessarily increase the velocity that we see. Our teams have been engaged with municipalities across the country on getting permits to put up small cells whether for 4G or 5G. Certainly like the fact that they are providing a little more guidance for how quickly that should happen. But I don't see it having a material impact to our build out plans. We are going as fast as we can. And while the federal level rules are helpful it is still a very local activity municipality-by-municipality. So a lot of good work going on there. On Oath from a profitability standpoint certainly as we said in the comments revenue not progressing quite as fast as we'd like, but from an EBITDA standpoint the team's made good progress on their synergy targets coming out of the closing on Yahoo over a year ago. The integration is now largely complete. We think we will have that substantially complete by the end of the year. So the cost side of that business is being managed well, and we just need the revenue side of the business to achieve its potential too and then we will be happy with what we are doing in the Oath business.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew Ellis: Brad we are ready for the next one please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess just if I want to return to the question a couple of questions ago about growth. You've always said in the past that you can be something like a GDP grower. If I kind of step back from today's results what are the moving pieces that get this business back to being a GDP grower at some point?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So Craig when you look at the results we posted today, I'm not sure we have to say what it would take to get back to that level. I think you are seeing growth in the business year to date both at the top line and the bottom line. And it is driven by largely by what's going on in the wireless business. When you have the best network and when we get it paired up with the right consumer offerings as we have and our wireless consumers can take advantage of that network and the way they want to do so you see the results we have. We see customers step up and as I said earlier we have still got significant runway in terms of the ability for customers to step up. So like the number of increasing connections we had during the quarter increase in ARPA as well, and we very focused on continuing that momentum. There is a high level of stability in the core of our business. So that's driving top-line growth as we reported this morning. And then as we also manage the cost side I think we will continue to have the opportunity to post good results.\nCraig Moffett: If I could just follow-up I mean presumably just given the maturity of the industry with respect to penetration it's presumably an ARPU or ARPA story as you get to 5G. What kind of ARPU and ARPA growth do you think that you could eventually get to in this business, obviously barring any unforeseen big changes in competitive intensity.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So we continue to look for new pockets of demand out there. You know, b0ut this maturity comment we've talked about for a long time now but we posted smartphone net adds of 510,000 during the quarter. So we are continuing to add to our base of customers. There is still a significant opportunity to do that. We have the opportunity to get a number of our customers stepped up from their current price plans. They often come in on a bucketed data device and then over time they step-up into unlimited. And we now have options there for customers to step-up to different levels of unlimited plans too. So we still have runway here in terms of developing the wireless business in the 4G world. And then before we know it we will be talking about transitioning the largest base of wireless customers in the industry over to 5G devices too. So I am certainly comfortable that our wireless business will continue to grow as we go forward.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. You talked a bit about the cost cutting. And in the past I think the cadence you were looking for was an incremental $1 billion a year. So that would get you through a cumulative $10 billion over four years. You mentioned you are at $1.3 billion through nine months. So is there an opportunity to create even more cost savings over time than the $10 billion? Or is the $1.3 billion progress to-date just pulling from the future pulling forward some of those savings? And then secondly if you could just help us think about what the right cadence is over the next couple years in just broad cost-cutting terms? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Mike. So as we think about the cost cutting certainly glad to see the progress the teams have made this year. And as they have gone in and started looking at the business in different ways we are seeing lots of different opportunities show up. And now we are in the phase of really executing against a number of those. So certainly glad the progress we have made. Is there the opportunity to get more than $10 billion cumulatively over four years? We will wait and see. I am not good to provide any change to that number at this point in time but certainly we are being as aggressive as we can and making sure we are running as efficient a business as we possibly can and that will continue. In terms of the cadence of those savings over the four year period nothing really to update. I think we are still in the first year. And as you can imagine as you start a program like this there is a lot of energy upfront just deciding the things you want to do identifying the opportunities deciding how you are going to go after them. And so you are not necessarily turning them into savings immediately. So I think we've still got some good opportunity ahead of us from a cadence standpoint.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Okay, Brad, I think we are ready for the next one.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead with your question.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you for the taking the question. I wanted to ask about the public safety sector. Obviously with AT&T officially having FirstNet it seems in their advertising they are going hard after this sector which some have identified the TAM is as many as 9 million subs. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy there? Because you have exposure to hold onto these customers. What are you seeing in that? Are you seeing any early signs of churn or anything like that? Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: We continue to perform very well in that sector and it is built on years and years of strong partnerships, and we will be continuing to focus on that sector. Look, when you have large market share in many segments as we do, it provides opportunities for different people to decide to go attack them, whether it'd be in public sector with FirstNet or whether it'd be some of the things we've seen other competitors do over the past few years. I think we have been very effective at defending the market share that we have. It's based on building deep relationships with our customers, and builds on the reliability and the performance that they see on a consistent basis. So, we will continue to do that across all parts of our business, Jennifer, and it's really about just service execution. And when we do that on a consistent basis we typically win.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Okay. Brad, let's move to the next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead with your question.\nJeff Kvaal: Thanks a lot. Two questions if I may. The first is on CapEx. I think you have been pretty clear with us that we should not be expecting a surge in spending associated with 5G. I am wondering if that premise or how we should be measuring that surge from. Is that from where we began the year in 2018 with guidance or from where we are ending the year in 2018 with CapEx? And then secondly on churn, obviously great improvement over the past couple years although that improvement has reversed a little bit. I am wondering what you can tell us about what's happening with churn and what we can expect from here. Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Jeff. On CapEx, so really as you say no surge level. We'll give guidance for 2019 when we get into the New Year. We will be spending on 5G. You may not see a change in intensity, but we are spending on 5G today. We will continue to spend on 5G just as quickly as we can. But as we've talked about in the past, 5G uses a lot of the assets we already have in place. As we've been densifying the 4G network over the past three, four years now, we've been doing it with an eye also to pre-positioning the network for 5G. And we are seeing the benefit of that. As you see us roll out 5G and get the network ready to deploy and not seeing a massive surge in CapEx, and we've been pretty consistent on that messaging, and I think it's starting to show up. So, look, I think you'll see CapEx stay within reasonable bounds of what you've seen from us in the past. And we will continue to take advantage of the efficiencies in the network whether that is through the Intelligent Edge Network design, which will create efficiencies. Whether it's across the other things we're doing on the business excellent side I spoke about earlier. We will continue to look for ways to build the network that we want to build to provide the best customer experiences, but doing it at the lowest possible capital intensity. So, obviously we will talk more about the plans for 2019 in 90 days or so, but feel pretty good about the activity we have in the network as we complete 2018. From a churn standpoint you are right. We've seen good performance over the past, the past couple of years. And as I have mentioned, when you get the combination of the best network, which we've obviously had for a long time and when you get the customer proposition right as well, you get great results whether that's on net adds or whether that's on the churn side of the equation. And we've seen that now for over a year on the churn side. So look there is additional players in the marketplace today obviously with using the MVNO agreements and some other things. So we may see just a few points tick up there, but we'll continue to have very strong churn performance as we look forward here and expect to do so.\nJeff Kvaal: Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Brad, let's move to next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. You may go ahead with your question. Mr. McCormack you may need to check the mute button on your phone.\nMike McCormack: Hey, guys sorry about that. Hey, Matt maybe just a quick comment on what appears to be a pretty good uptick in gross adds - gross phone adds on a year-over-year basis. Thinking about what the drivers might be there. Obviously last year you had introduced the unlimited plan earlier in the year so it seemed like you had maybe a tougher comp. Just trying to get a sense for whether we are seeing any prepaid migrations or anything else in the marketplace we should be aware of? And then on the Fios video side I guess no real surprise but yes downtick in sub losses there. Is that really just a function of lack of connects or are we seeing an uptick in churn on the Fios video site? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks Mike. So on the phone gross adds and you mentioned the comp in 3Q. And as I'm sure everyone recalls 3Q last year was when we saw the first sequential revenue growth in about three years. So as we came into this quarter we knew we were lapping a good quarter from a year ago. So to see the performance in wireless this quarter is certainly something that we are pleased about the way that the organization has performed in the marketplace. When you think about the phone gross adds, as I said it's really the combination of the great network experience. And when we went on unlimited people were concerned what was going to happen with the network experience. And we talked at the time that the network team had tested prepped for moving to unlimited. And all we have seen since we have been on unlimited is our network performance continue to improve. And in fact as we sit here in the second half of 2018, I think we are continuing to see us widen the lead and set the standard for the rest of the industry. So, that's part of it. And then you get the right offer out there. So we launched unlimited. And since we launched unlimited we have added other flavors to it. We see customers enjoying that experience and expect them to continue to do so. In terms of the prepaid-to-postpaid migration the thing I point your attention to is within the third quarter in our prepaid business we had smartphone net adds of positive 15,000. So while there certainly is some level of migration from prepaid to postpaid it's not driving the 510,000 smartphone net adds that we recorded in the quarter. So we are very happy with the performance that we saw there. And again comes back to combining the right network experience and the right customer proposition and good things happen at that point. On the Fios video side I think just what we are seeing here is - is you touched on is it's the secular trend. Whether it be cord-cutting or cord-nevers that certainly continues. What I am pleased about on the Fios side of the business is we saw Internet net adds of 54,000. That says there is strong demand for broadband. And as we have said before if you're going to rely on OTT for your video entertainment you want to make sure you have got a great broadband experience. And whether that be Fios broadband or now for those customers who can get in-home broadband through 5G. We believe we have the best in-home experience out there for those customers who want to get their entertainment from an OTT fashion. So we will continue to see pressure on the TV numbers, but I would expect us to continue to grow the broadband side of our Fios franchise.\nMike McCormack: I am sorry Matt. Do you see an uptick in churn there or is it just less connects coming in on the video side?\nMatthew Ellis: Well it's certainly less connects coming in and we see more new customers come in as broadband only. We still see a number come in as triple play. And the churn side, I think is part of the equation too. But I would start off with its less gross adds coming in upfront and us seeing more customers - the mix of new customers as broadband only versus traditional triple play.\nMike McCormack: Great. Thanks Matt.\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, Brad, I think we are going to take two more questions. So let's go to next one please. Brad, you with us?\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. You may ask your question.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Hey, Matt the upgrade rate, the decline in it has really helped your cash EBITDA in recent years. Record low, it looks like 5%. Can you give us a sense on kind of how the fourth quarter has been going so far relative to the XR was launched? And even just looking into 2019, can you continue to expect a benefit to your cash EBITDA by lower and lower upgrade rates? And then my second question on the prepaid side, I mean, prepaid is obviously tiny relative to the overall business. Does it make sense to even maintain a prepaid product? And would you be interested in scaling up that through an acquisition if Sprint T-Mobile were required to make some divestitures or if TracFone was looking to sell that business? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Walt. So on the prepaid side, while certainly postpaid is the bigger part of our wireless business, we want to give customers the opportunity to experience the Verizon network however they want to come on board. So we value our prepaid customers. We certainly look to focus our prepaid business on the parts of that business that add value. And not all part of the prepaid segment does, so you have seen us change our approach there. You should expect us to look for ways to provide offerings to customers across the full spectrum of customers, whether that be prepaid, postpaid, or whatever. And we will continue to evolve the offerings there. But as you say, prepaid is certainly a small part of our business, but it is an important part of our business. And we will continue to evolve and adapt the product offering there over time. I'm not going to speculate on any other - anyone else's customers or so on. That is not what we are focused on. We are focused on our offerings and we will continue to do so. In terms of the upgrade rate decline, and while there has certainly been some benefit there, I would say the bigger benefit to cash flow has come from just the operational performance of the business. Certainly the lower upgrade rate has helped. I don't see that changing anytime soon. Certainly as we get into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see seasonal uptick in the upgrade rate. But whether it will be at the same levels we saw in the last couple of years or whether we will see a slight year-over-year decline, it's too soon in the season to tell. Obviously, we are not one month into the fourth quarter and the heavy part of the fourth quarter activity is still ahead of us. In terms of there are new devices out there, as you know, and they have been performing about as we had expected. And whether that be - you mentioned the Apple devices. And also the Google Pixel is a great device, a new device out there, and we are seeing very strong demand for that as well. So we will see where the upgrade rate comes out for the quarter as a whole. But I don't see a major change from the trends we've seen over the past couple of years.\nWalter Piecyk: Great, thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Walt. Hey, Brad, I think we got time for one more.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead with your question.\nMatt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones. One on enterprise, if you can share any color on how competitive intensity and pricing trends have been going in Enterprise of late whether there has been any change there. And then just go back to the question on Oath, are there monetization opportunities you would evaluate with Oath given the relative scale relative to some of the larger players in that space? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Matt. So, on Oath the team is focused on the right things. As I mentioned, they are driving demand in mobile and video offerings. And as I said, we have some great assets and talented people in there at this point. The business growth is not yet consistent with the quality of the assets of the people, but they are working hard and we believe they are going to get there. And that's what we are focused on, is supporting that team and the efforts they have. I would also point out the value that it's harder for people to see that came with the Oath business around some of the very strong technical skills, whether that'd be in data analytics, artificial intelligence, VR. And really taking those skills and deploying them across the totality of the Verizon business is providing significant value, too. On the Enterprise side, I would say no major change in the competitive intensity. We're certainly seeing businesses looking to do more, and change the connectivity profiles of their businesses, but we also are seeing pricing pressure in there as well. So what's going to determine our success there is if we continue to develop the products enterprises are looking for, not just for today, but for tomorrow. And as we continue to do that, that will be the determinant of our success in that space. The team is very focused on doing that. They've had a number of good wins this year. And if we keep on that trajectory, I think we have a chance to like where we will end up.\nMatt Niknam: Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Matt. Hey, Brad, that's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt for some closing comments.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The 5G Era is here and we are positioning the Company for long-term growth by taking advantage of the full array of opportunities they have to offer. During the quarter, we again delivered solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by building the best networks creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model, and creating value for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-07-24 15:36:07", "content": "Executives: Brady Connor - SVP, IR Lowell McAdam - Chairman & CEO Hans Vestberg - Incoming CEO Matthew Ellis - CFO\nAnalysts: John Hodulik - UBS Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Philip Cusick - JPMorgan David Barden - Bank of America Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Michael Rollins - Citi Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson Jennifer Fritzsch - Wells Fargo\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Lowe McAdam , our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hans Vestberg, our incoming Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials which we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Before I turn the call over to Low for his remarks, let me start with a walk through of the second quarter consolidated earnings on Slide 3. For the second quarter of 2018 we reported earnings of $1 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings this quarter included charge for product realignment of $658 million, mainly related to the discontinuation of the go90 platform and associated content. Severance charges of $339 million, and acquisition integration related charges of $120 million primarily consisting of costs pertaining to Oath. The net impact of these items after-tax was approximately $0.9 billion or $0.20 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard adjusted earnings per share was $0.99 in the second quarter compared to $0.96 a year ago. On a comparable basis adjusted earnings per share before the impacts of tax reform and revenue recognition were up 3.1% year-over-year. Let's now turn to Slide 4. Consistent with the approach we established last quarter we have provided a table that illustrates the ongoing effects from the adoption of the revenue recognition standard on our financial results. As a reminder, the adoption of the revenue recognition standard results in a reduction of the wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue, as well as the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent throughout the first two quarters of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, the cumulative impact of revenue recognition was $0.14 per share. For the full year we expect the impact of earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenue and commission costs converge. But the remainder of this call, financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Lowe.\nLowell McAdam: Thank you, Brady and good morning everyone. This is the last time I'll have to discuss Verizon results with you so I'd like to take a minute and offer some perspective after serving as Verizon CEO for the past seven years. When I first took over from Ivan in 2011, the company was well positioned for the future. We were leading the charge in the wireless industry by pushing the ecosystem and driving new user experiences with our robust launch of 4G LTE service. We were growing our fiber to the home business, Fios, and expanding penetration in highly competitive markets. The company had a strong balance sheet and financial profile so that we had the flexibility to execute whatever strategy we chose. If I look at where we are today, once again the company is well positioned for the future. Our financial and operating results for the first half of 2018 are strong as evidenced by our service revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. Verizon has 100% ownership of our wireless business and it's industry-leading network and customer base. We have driven the 5G ecosystem by pushing the industry to adopt the next-generation several years ahead of original expectations. And we are positioned to be the clear leader in the deployment of 5G services based on our technological expertise, asset base, engineering talent and spectrum portfolio. This leadership position is attracting opportunities in areas such as over-the-top TV, smart cities, transportation, education and healthcare; just to name a few. I believe the impact of 5G on consumers will be much bigger than any previous generation but the biggest impact will be on businesses as we provide the platform for the fourth industrial revolution. We know the consumer requires a mobile first digital information experience, and the new businesses that we have added such as Oath and our IoT platforms are poised to be at the forefront of enhancing our ability to meet this growing customer demand. Our Fios business and our recent one fiber expansion have proven that fiber-based network solutions will continue to be in high demand and can take significant share in mature markets. The cornerstone of our strategy will always be network leadership and customer experience. Verizon has an outstanding leadership team, a unique portfolio of assets, solid financial profile and a strong balance sheet that enables us to deliver on the promise of the digital world. I'm also pleased to mention our recently announced tentative agreement with our unions to extend our labor contracts through August 2023; this will give all of our employees the ability to focus on our customers and execute our strategies without disruption. One of my least fond memories as CEO was a strike five days after taking over; I'm glad Hans won't share that experience. What Brady didn't tell you when he started the call this morning is that the four of us are in Houston, Texas; it's an honor for us to be in Houston today to talk about our second quarter results, spend valuable time with our employees in the area and celebrate the quality of our customers in this great city. We have an excellent relationship with the city, with Mayor Turner, and with the greater Houston area, and we are very proud of our overall customer experience, network performance and community involvement, especially during some of the hardest times like Hurricane Harvey. Verizon and the nation's best wireless network worked tirelessly to provide customers, loved ones, and first responders with an unparalleled level of reliability and quality when it matters the most. It is with great pleasure that we announce here today Houston as the third of our four initial commercial launch markets for our 5G residential broadband service that will be rolled out later this year. This is an exciting time for our company and the industry; I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that Verizon is making and our recent appointment of Hans Vestberg as CEO solidifies the leadership of this great company for years to come. As I've said before, I'm confident that Hans is the right person to bring Verizon and into it's next chapter and he is the energizing force we need to position Verizon to lead the upcoming fourth industrial revolution. Matt will now take you through the details of our second quarter financial results which highlight the strength of Verizon. Hans will then outline our strategic priorities and talk about the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks Lowe, and thank you for the many years of leadership and the support and encouragement you have provided to all of us. I'd like to start by reviewing the consolidated results on Slide 6. Consolidated revenue was $32.2 billion on a reported basis including the impacts of revenue recognition. Excluding the impact of Oath and divested businesses, consolidated revenue is $30.2 billion, an increase of approximately 2.6%. The wireless business continues to be the primary driver of growth generating solid service revenue results. On a GAAP reported basis, we are expecting low to mid-single digit percentage consolidated revenue growth for the full year. The update of full year revenue guidance is due to better than expected equipment revenue trends. Excluding special items, second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.6%, down from the prior year's margin of 36.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.2 billion due to service revenue performance and as we continue to drive operational efficiencies across the business. Strong revenue momentum and solid margin performance keep us on-track to achieve low single digit percentage growth and adjusted EPS in 2018 before the net impact of tax reform and revenue recognition. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2018 to be at the low end of our guided range of 24% to 26%. Let's now focus on cash flow results and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Our business segments are generating substantial cash flows. During the second quarter of 2018 cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.8 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion from the prior year and $3.1 billion sequentially; this was driven by strong results from the business, benefits from tax reform, and the completion of the transition to on balance sheet financing of our device payment plan receivables. But the second quarter -- capital spending was $3.3 billion bringing the year-to-date spend to $7.8 billion. We currently expect capital expenditures for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our guided range of $17 billion to $17.8 billion driven by efficiencies from our business excellence initiatives and CapEx management process, as well as the Intelligent Edge Network design. 2018 capital expenditures include deploying 5G for both, residential broadband and mobility launches. Free cash flow totaled $6.5 billion in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with $114.6 billion of total debt which was comprised of $106 billion from secured debt and $8.6 billion of secured debt. As we stated at the beginning of the year, we intend to use the majority of the benefits from tax reform in 2018 to strengthen the balance sheet. We began to realize these benefits during the second quarter and our total debt balance declined by $4.4 billion sequentially. Our capital allocation methodology remains consistent focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders. Now let's move on to reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. Total wireless operating revenue increased 4.7% to $22.3 billion in the second quarter. Service revenue continues to generate strong results producing a 2.5% increase excluding the impact of revenue recognition driven by customer step-ups to higher access plans and increases in the average connections per account. Sequentially, service revenue increased by 1.5%. On a reported basis including the impact from revenue recognition, service revenue increased by 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Customer migration to unsubsidized pricing continues to approach a steady state, currently at 82% for the quarter as compared to 75% a year ago, and 81% in the first quarter. In the second quarter equipment revenue increased 6.8% driven by higher priced handsets more than offsetting a reduction in activation volumes. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter consistent with the prior year. Our wireless EBITDA was $10.3 billion in the second quarter which represents an increase of 5.5%. As a percent of total revenue EBITDA margin was 46.2%, up from 45.8% a year ago and was relatively flat on a sequential basis. Let's now turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. Wireless continues to deliver solid results driven by the quality of our network experience and strong customer retention. In the second quarter net phone additions were 199,000 including 398,000 smartphones, postpaid net adds totaled 531,000 including tablet net losses of 37,000 offset by 369,000 other connected devices led by wearable's. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.75% is a result of our compelling customer experience on the nation's best network. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of customer retention at 0.80% or better. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.97% was slightly up compared to 0.94% in the prior year. In the quarter, postpaid device activations were 4.6% lower than the prior year of which about 80% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0% as compared to 5.6% a year ago. During the quarter, 5.8 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid activity in the quarter reflected a total net loss of 236,000 devices compared to 19,000 prepaid net adds in the prior year. 150,000 of the prepaid losses in the quarter were basic phones. Now let's move to our wireline segment on Slide 10. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.4% from the quarter due to ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition, partially offset by growth from our high quality fiber-based products. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.4% driven by legacy core declines partially offset by Fios growth. Fios consumer revenue increased by 1.7% primarily due to our broadband offerings. In Fios we added 43,000 internet customers and had video losses of 37,000 in the quarter. Internet ads were driven by strong demand as customers value their broadband connection more than ever before. Video results continue to face macro pressures from chord-cutting [ph]. Enterprise Solutions revenue decreased 4.2% from the quarter driven by declines in legacy services partially offset by growth in our fiber-based products. On a constant currency basis, revenue is down 5.1%. Partner Solutions revenue declined 2.8%, the increasing customer demand for fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business and is mitigating declines in copper-based products. Within business markets revenue decreased 7.4% mainly due to reductions in CPE sales and ongoing headwinds from legacy services. Fiber-based products continue to grow and are becoming a more significant component of recurring revenue. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 19.6% excluding the impacts of revenue recognition. Price compression on legacy products, secular trends and increasing content cost continue to pressure wireline margin performance. Excluding the impact from revenue recognition we expect margins to be around 20% for the near-term. Let's now move on to Slide 11 to discuss our Media and IoT businesses. During the second quarter the Oath team continue to build out and operationalize it's content strategy and make progress towards the integration of Ad products into one interlinked cross platform and cross device solution. As we highlighted on our last call, the video platform became integrated in the first quarter. During the second quarter, half of the demand side platform for Ad inventory was integrated and Oath is on-track to complete integrating the remaining components of the platform within the second half of the year. We expect to see momentum build after advertisers and content owners have the ability to come to us on a single platform. For the second quarter Oath revenue is $1.9 billion which was relatively flat on a sequential basis. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue including Verizon Connect was up approximately 13%. Let's now move to Slide 12 to summarize our second quarter results. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results and our business is well positioned for growth into the future. Consolidated revenue growth was led by wireless service revenue turning positive, inclusive of the headwinds from revenue recognition. Our unlimited offerings are evolving to provide a new level of flexibility enabling people to customize their experience on the nation's best network. Churn rates remain low signaling excellent customer satisfaction and retention of the nation's best wireless customer base. Last year we announced our goal to drive $10 billion in cumulative cash savings throughout the business over a four year period. Our business excellence initiative which includes zero-based budgeting is off to a solid start in 2018, it has yielded approximately $500 million of cumulative cash savings on a year-to-date basis. Most of the incremental cash savings realized in the second quarter related to network activities and are reflected in the lower total capital spend. The program remains on-track to deliver against our goals over the four year period. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased year-over-year driven by the strength of our revenue performance and operational efficiencies realized across the business. Finally, we are making significant strides in honoring our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet. We substantially reduced net debt within the quarter and the business is generating strong cash flows as we prepare for the upcoming launch of 5G. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to discuss our strategic priorities.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. First, let me say that it's a great honor to be named successor to Lowell, and I'm humbled by the opportunity to lead this great company. I'm looking forward to being part of leading the digitalization era into the more technology advanced market in the world which will have significantly positive impact on consumers, industries and our society for decades to come. During my tenure with your Verizon I've been actively involved in setting the strategy and priorities for the company alongside Lowell, the board, and the rest of the leadership team. We have a laid our focus on execution on the fundamentals, we're positioning the business of future growth, maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and driving sustainable financial performance for long-term value creation. We remain committed to announcing our network leadership position, strengthening our customer relationship, and driving efficiencies throughout the business. Verizon has assets in place to develop and provide the most advanced next-generation network which we called Verizon's Intelligent Edge Network. We are positioned for growth in the current generation and we are leading the way to fully capture the significant opportunity that lies ahead in the transition to the fifth generation of wireless services. We continue to be the clear leader in 4G performance driving further innovation, growth opportunities and implementing new network capabilities that will further enhance our customer's experience. We have made the strategic invest in millimeter way [ph], spectrum that enable ultra-wideband 5G services. Our fiber [indiscernible] would build out on the way in over 50 markets outside of our higher ILEC footprint that will allow us to take full advantage of the many used cases that will come to bear in 5G. Our Intelligent Edge Network design allows us to realize significant efficiencies by utilizing common infrastructure [ph] in the core and providing flexibility at the edge of the network to meet customer requirements. Our Oath and IoT assets will provide a platform for us to participate in the use cases that 5G will enable. We're rapidly approaching the launch of our first use case for 5G with a roll-up of residential broadband services. As you know, Sacramento and Los Angeles are two of four initial commercial launch market and you heard Lowell earlier announce Houston few minutes ago. News and updates on our full [ph] market will be provided soon. Residential broadband is here the first of many use cases for 5G that will be deployed on our multi-use network. Progress is well on the way across all of the use cases and we remain focused on providing 5G mobility in 2019. I'm super-excited for the future, we're on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution and we have the assets in place to take full advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead. Now I will turn the call back over to Brady so we can get to your questions.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Hans. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Lowe, first I'd like to say congrats on your retirement and your career at Verizon, it's been really -- I've really enjoyed working with you over the years. And also quickly for Hans, it will be great working with you as you take the reins going forward. So Lowe, during your tenure as CEO you've really -- Verizon has really stuck to it's core competency of wireless network leadership while other companies have moved to diversify into adjacent areas. How confident are you that this is the right path? And as we look ahead to 5G deployment and adoption, do you believe that Verizon can sort of widen the gap and create a sustainable advantage versus other carriers [ph]? Thanks.\nLowell McAdam: I think your strategy is based on the assets that you have in your portfolio and where you think you can go with a high degree of success. We talk about competing to win, we don't want to play to play, we want to play to win. We've looked at the things that we've done, network leadership is at the core, it's part of the values of the company, every individual here is proud of what we do on network leadership; and we've stayed close to that core, branching out though into things like Verizon Connect and Oath is a very logical near progression for us, and we see the advantages that will strengthen the core going forward. If I look at the things I'm proudest of, it's the things that you mentioned that we've done and pushing the envelope on 5G and 4G are some of those. I also love to say a little bit with a smile on my face, I'm glad we didn't follow a lot of the things the analysts and the bankers told us we had to do and that's put us in a position now that Matt outlined where we've got a strong balance sheet, we've got a clear strategy, and I think we are going to put a significant distance between us and the competition; and the first mover on the network generation changes usually gains a significant amount of market share, and with the assets that we have we think we're in that position with 5G.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: I also wanted to share my best wishes to Lowell, good luck with your retirement. Good to hear the news about Houston; you've talked about a $30 million plus opportunity for the residential broadband, can you just help us think about the pacing of that? How are you thinking about the initial timing of the rollout? How many markets we'll see in terms of pops covered over the next 12-24 months? And then on the mobility side, you're starting to talk about that a bit more, we've heard some of your competitors talk about how many markets to launch this year; how rapidly do you think you're going to roll that out? And is that all going to be microwave or you're going to use some lower balance [ph] for the mobility 5G? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: So when it comes to the fixed wireless access, so as I said in the beginning, we will have an initial commercial launch of four markets this year, that's going to be based on our sort of software that we developed in the beginning calling TS [ph]. We are preparing the whole network with Intelligent Edge Network to be ready to launch 5G based on the and/or [ph] standard that is coming out right now; and vendors -- and again, equipment manufacturers and OEMs are preparing right now. So we will be ready as soon as that has the majority to be released to our customers; so that they will come back when we'll go for the full 30 million households which is our own ambitions that we have explained before. So that's where we are on the fixed wireless access. On the mobility, we do the same. Remember the Intelligent Edge Network is a multi-use network, so it's a same rate base station that is going to provide our fixed wireless access as mobility. So we are and as I said before, I mean we are now in deployment on fiber in more than 50 cities. So we are preparing everything to be ready for the majority of the equipment and the software's as well as having the CPE and handset market ready for launching those products, and right now that's the ambitions we see in 2019, we have not named the cities but as you can here we are deploying in 50 markets with fiber sales [ph], and I think that's an important point of it. So that's where we are and we will come back and give you updates all the time on the new things we're doing and today we're now launching the third city here in Houston, we're super excited over that; so we'll continue to flow all the information on what we're doing on 5G.\nSimon Flannery: And when should you launch the first of the Sacramento, LA, Houston? Is that going to be in the third quarter or more likely the fourth?\nHans Vestberg: Good question. Well, as we say -- we say that in the second half of 2018; so we promise we will come out and tell you as soon as we know exactly the date.\nOperator: The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick: Hans, can you talk us through what's happening on the CapEx side to move towards the lower end of the guide; are you doing less this year than you expected or just getting more for it? And where are you in the shift of spending and focus from macro towers to more fiber and small cell? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I think this is a great question; remember when I came in -- we decided together with Matt, Lowell and the whole management team to actually flip the whole network to the -- sort of the horizontal Intelligent Edge Network. And I also experienced there were two important factors where we did that; one, we wanted to deliver new type of services based on a horizontal network, especially the ones coming from 5G and we want to see some of them coming up very shortly. The second was that we also could be so much more efficient with new technologies in multipurpose equipment. At the same time we put in the new process for capital efficiency that Matt and I are sharing, and I think that's what you're seeing right now; we are actually doing much more than before when it comes to deployment. Then as we say here, we are already deploying 5G things at the moment, we're preparing all the network for it, so that's embedded in the numbers that you see. At the same time we also are making a big shift in our whole spending; I mean if I look what we spend in 2017 in the capital result CapEx than in 2018 it's very different; so we're also making shift at all time but this is nothing that we're limiting, we used our more efficient of using our capital and my engineering team are very happy with the investment that we're doing at the moment. So I think that we are also -- as you said, we are moving over to much more small cells than making bigger towers and macro cells. And I will say, if you go back a couple of years ago our -- majority of all our investment was on macro towers and today the majority is on densification with smaller cells. So we have shifted dramatically over the years and I've only been part of it now for more than one year but I've seen how the engineering team is responding to the new way of working and setting up the whole new network structure. So that's what you seen in the figures.\nPhilip Cusick: If I can follow-up; anything you can tell us given that efficiency about where 2019 CapEx might be upward or downward from 2018? Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: We'll stay consistent with what we've done in the past where we'll talk about 2019 we get closer to that but I think we've been pretty consistent in our commentary that -- look, we expect CapEx to be reasonably consistent and as we [indiscernible] is to accelerate any spend on 5G as we see it but it's little too early in the process to get there yet. I'll just remind you as Hans said, a lot of the spending that we've been doing around densification supports both 4G and 5G. So the network really is in a great position to be preposition for us moving into 5G here without it requiring a significant step change in total spend. We've done this before, has moved from one generation of technology to another, and keeping total CapEx spend fairly consistent and we're confident we'll do that again.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Matt, could I just ask some questions on the finance side, just on the lower tax guide -- could you talk about the reasons why that is and is that flowing through to the cash flow side of the equation, and do we need to address that in the free cash flow number as well? And then the second one is, could you talk about -- I think as we've done historically, some of the changes in the union contracts forthcoming -- how should we think about that impact on the cost structure, I know you gave us about 20% margin in the wireline side for this year but is that -- did those negotiations give you some window in potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: I'll start with the tax question. So, as you look at the first half of the year the ETR [ph] was impacted certainly by tax reform but we had a couple of one-timers in there, especially related to the pension contribution we did in first quarter that you wouldn't see necessarily flow through to the second half of the year, so that's why we're guiding towards the lower end of the 24% to 26% range for the year as a whole. In terms of it flowing through to the cash flow; you know, I would say certainly you should expect cash taxes to be positively impacted this year by tax reform. We didn't have that in the first quarter because we had no scheduled payments; as you know, second quarter we had the first of two scheduled payments for the year and so started to see those flow through, expect to see lower tax rate flow through to our cash tax payments in the rest of the year and that's certainly behind the commentary that we gave around the ability to strengthen the balance sheet this year. So expect to continue to see the benefit from the lower tax rate. I'll let Lowell answer your question around the new union contract.\nLowell McAdam: David, we're really pleased with the relationship that we've built with the union. During the last contract we get together at the senior level very frequently, we've been able to deal with some issues that had been thorns on the side for both, the union leadership and members, as well as the company. So when we decided to attempt to get a contract literally a year ahead of expiration -- that was a major change in our relationship, and I would like to thank the union leadership for the way -- the approach that they took during this. As far as your financial projections; I would say just continue with the projections that you've seen, we do have increases and contributions and that sort of thing but it's not a significant change to the bottom-line trajectory that you've seen the way it was after our last contract. But the beauty of all of this is now the management and all of our employees can focus on our customers and deploying 5G and deploying fiber, and they can all focus on work and their families and the customer instead of getting ready for a strike; and so we're very, very pleased about this outcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And I'd also like to extend my congrats to Lowell for a distinguished career, and to Hans for the opportunity that lies ahead. I was hoping I could ask about postpaid ARPA; that metric has been under pressure for the last several years although it's shown a lot of stabilization recently. And even though you don't breakout phone ARPU intrinsically, we all know that it was phone ARPU that was causing that pressure as subs moved into EIP, and more recently into the unlimited plans. It seems like the EIP transition or the unsubsidized transition is fully behind us, I'm not entirely sure we are in the migration to the new unlimited plan; so I guess I was just kind of hoping you could talk through the drivers of postpaid ARPA going forward. Do we still have any headwind on the phone side, is that becoming a tailwind? And then of course you've highlighted you are seeing a lot of other devices including wearable's come into your accounts? Are we starting to get to the point where that's becoming a meaningful positive driver on ARPA as well? Thanks.\nLowell McAdam: As you look ARPA, you're right that the transition to the device payment plans is essentially complete, the year-over-year difference in terms of the percentage of the base unsubsidized pricing is now in single digits as far as a year ago it was much more significant; so that shows up in ARPA. The other good things in the ARPA though is -- you continue to see the demand for our products and services, so we continued in the quarter to have our customers step up in terms of the plans they are on, whether that be from a metered [ph] plan to unlimited or even within our unlimited plans that we offer. And then we continue to see increases in connections per account whether that be wearable's or additional phones on the account; those things are coming through to ARPA and you see the impact there on service revenue overall. So certainly ARPA is stabilizing and we think as we continue to offer the right plans to customers and we continue to give them the opportunities to add additional devices to their plans that it's an area where we can continue to help drive revenue growth going forward.\nBrett Feldman: Have you broken out how many of your customers are on unlimited plans? I apologize if I missed that.\nLowell McAdam: We have not. As we said previously between unlimited and our Verizon 2.0 plans where customers have the ability to control over Edge, that would be significantly above 50% and certainly the number of customers unlimited continues to grow but we haven't broken that out at this point but it's becoming certainly a larger and larger percentage at the base.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.\nMichael Rollins: First on the strategic side; as I listened to the management commentary over the past year -- is the underlying goal for Verizon to become a leading provider of broadband in the home and on the go across the country? And if this is the direction how long would it take and how much can be driven by internal investments versus possible M&A? And then just one thing on the business trends; postpaid phone were at the industry level has risen more than twice the rate of population growth, do you have any thoughts on what's driving this change and the sustainability for postpaid phones at this new level of growth? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Maybe I can start with the network question that you had on broadband. I think when I look into the assets we have and I've been now working here for quite a while; I really like the assets we have and the ones we're building, that will give us the opportunity to be much larger, broader than providing and I think the announcement that we did today that we now are having using it as well and we will continue without communication on the new cities we are going to deploy on; 5G gave us that opportunity. But we need to remember when we talk about 5G -- 5G is an access technology, there is so much more you need to do to actually have it, when I look what we are doing all the way from the data center with fiber unified transport, multi-service routers, they are all way -- I see that this is a big undertaking but we are in the midst of it and I've said a couple of times before -- I mean we have been onto this Intelligent Edge Network right now for quite a while and we see the benefits and we see the opportunity that is great. So you're right, of course it's going to take time to have it across the country but as I mentioned, we're already now deploying fiber in 50 cities. So we will come back and give you more color to it but I think we are preparing the network to be really using the networks and levering the efficiency markets; so that's for us a very important piece of it.\nMatthew Ellis: On the postpaid phone, you know we continue to see consumer demand there. And we believe certainly we'll give customers the opportunity to get on the nation's best network and we have the right price plans, we see good things happen there; so I can't comment in terms of the industry volumes overall but we certainly continue to see good consumer demand and we expect to continue to have postpaid phone net growth going forward, and we'll see how that plays out across the rest of the industry. One other comment I'll just add on the network side is, in addition to the broadband pace -- as we've talked about the strategy, it's -- once you have that pace what we -- the services that we can provide above that connectivity layer are also very important as we go forward, and we think we're in a great place to be able to deliver on that too. So hopefully that helps your questions, Mike.\nLowell McAdam: And Mike, I think I'd just add one thing; it's funny when you're at this point in your career you get to look back and you see an awful lot of similar questions but just asked in a different way; I remember when we brought Verizon together back in '99 and we had about 20% market penetration on postpaid and there was no smartphone and people were saying, where is the industry going, you can't possibly get anymore penetration than you've gotten. And at that point I pointed to areas like Sweden, Hans's home country that was at 50% penetration, and we're -- see we've got all sorts of headroom and now we're over 100% penetration and you see wearable's, and with 5G, and Hans mentioned this, and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, you're going to see so much more penetration on all of the different business applications that are going to change people's lives. I really don't think much about postpaid or smartphones or any category you want to look at as an opportunity for future growth, there are so many things that we have literally 0% penetration on today that are going to be big businesses five years from now; that's why I'm so excited to see the way we're positioned and the leadership teams philosophy around dealing with customer pain points and providing on the products that they're going to need that will be indispensable five years from now; so that's my perspective on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Good morning, and let me join the parade of people saying congratulations to Lowell, it really has been a pleasure and also congratulations to you, Hans, I look forward to your great success. Let me ask a strategic question about video if I could; you've discontinued go90 in the quarter, there have at least been press reports about -- at least some discussion about how you move forward with Oath and whether Oath addressable advertising might actually be more successful outside the company instead of inside the company. I wonder if you could just talk about the role that you see video playing -- and now that you've had some time to play around with some of the different strategies around video and addressable advertising, and then as part of that if you could specifically comment on the situation in the press reports about Oath that would be helpful.\nLowell McAdam: Let me deal with those in reverse order there Craig and then I'll let Hans come in and put a period on it. The questions around Oath -- I don't know where they're coming from. There is no intention of spinning out Oath in any particular format. We see the synergies that we expected to see and we see the future that we had hoped for. Matt talked about in his remarks the integration efforts that are going on, they are on-schedule, and so we see no reason to do that and there's no credible report out there that are otherwise in my view. So I'd be clear about that. On the video side, look that is the major driver of traffic that we see on the network today; we only expect that to go up overtime. But we're not fans of linear but I'm not trying to criticize anybody else's strategy here, it's just the fact of the assets that we have and the investments that we want to make, it's much better in our view to do digital; so we're -- as we've always said skating to where the puck is going, so that's where we're focused. I was very heartened by our time in Sun Valley two weeks ago, Hans went and we met with all of the major content providers, the sports leagues, healthcare, education, gaming, all of those segments and every one of them when they know what is going on with 5G, and especially, the latency certainly along with the capacity but when they see the latency their eyes light up about what's possible. So my view is, and I know Hans shares this -- we've developed these strategies together, he has always been one of my go-to-guys over the last five years to see where the industry is going but it's our belief that we're positioned perfectly to have the partnerships that we need to be successful; we're not going to be owning contents or we're not going to be competing with other content providers, we're going to be their best partner from a distribution perspective and I think that makes great sense for the company going forward.\nHans Vestberg: And I can [indiscernible], I've been around now for quite a while, both as leading this but I've been seating together with Lowell, the management team, and the board on the strategic decision we've done and I'm fully onboard on all of them. And when I look at the assets we have, I'm really happy with them and I'm encouraged to see what we can do with them both, leverage them. And we also are going to get more of the synergies that Lowell talked about all of them [ph], and just talking about the Oath, for example; I mean today with the massive confidence we have in Oath when it comes to AIML [ph] and we are in the transformation of our network to virtualization that's a great synergy and creating a lot of newer possibilities for us on the front and we're constantly working how we can actually leverage our assets on our sort of the Verizon side and Oath side and we will continue to find those ways forward. So I feel good about the assets we have and I agree with Lowell that -- and we can partner with anyone and again, we are betting on that, we're going to have the best network, Intelligent Edge Network, we want to have a great 5G, the best; and of course, we can attract partners that we can work with and I think that is the model that we have and that we can continue to develop. And I see only opportunities when we go to 5G when you can build to connectivity platforms and applications, and sort of define where you're going to play in that or where you're going to have partners. So I'm feeling encouraged about the assets we have and what we can do with them.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo.\nJennifer Fritzsch: Can I just explore the wireline CapEx component -- it's down about $500 million from the first quarter and yet I hear you're doing it 50 fiber [ph] cities. Can you talk Matt maybe about the -- should we begin to see that wireline portion of that CapEx ramp as this fiber build comes together? And then I guess what does that mean for what I'll call traditional wireless spend? And then just separately on millimeter ways background, we do have an auction coming up in November, you guys have a lot of spectrum here; can you comment on interest if that might be part of your focus from the fall [ph]?\nMatthew Ellis: So on the CapEx side, certainly as you look between first and second quarter you got timing in there; but as we build out fiber and as you say, we mentioned the 50 cities outside of the ILEC footprint where we're deploying fiber today -- you'll see a blurring of the line of the CapEx between the segments, so obviously that fiber build shows up in our wireline segment but the largest customer for that build is the wireless piece of the business, so this is part of densifying the network, prepositioning the network to not just excel in 4G but also be ready for 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum as you mentioned. So I would expect to see a continuation of those spend but the total CapEx number as I said earlier, you should see consistency there, and as you -- what you're seeing is the continued evolution of our CapEx from one generation of technology to the next, and fiber build out is a key component of that. So you should expect to see a continuation of those trends and as part of the Intelligent Edge Network that will deliver 5G, and we're excited about it as we go forward. And I'll let Hans talk about millimeter wave.\nHans Vestberg: When we think about data usage of our network we usually talk in a couple of different ways in order to define what we need, and first of all we have the choice between densifying and deploying on more spectrum, I think that the last round of Oath spectrum we decided to densify and I think that is now paying out very well for us. Secondly, looking to all new type of technology and features coming out in a network that can optimize everything from carrier engagement, etcetera. And lastly, we of course look into what spectra we need to have; that is putting us in a very disciplined way how we use these three type of assets when we decide what to do in order to have the best return-on-investment. Of course, we are looking into any auction that's coming up and see how that fits in in that pattern of decision-making with these different type of options, so we will look into that. However, we're also feeling pretty good about the position we have on millimeter wave right now; but again, we will look into if there are any holes we need to feel in this process but again, it will be in that discussion all the way from densification, looking into new features on the technology, and then looking into what spectrum is needed, and then we have the disciplined approach to our return-on-investment.\nOperator: The next question is from Matthew Nicknam [ph] of Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: One, on 5G, what are you hearing from your larger commercial enterprise customers in terms of demand for specific use cases? I'm wondering if that can facilitate any sort of acceleration in your pace of builds heading into next year? And then secondly, maybe for Matt on tax reform, you talked about using the benefits this year at least to strengthen the balance sheet; how should we think about optimal leverage for the business today? And how do the uses of access cash and tax reform benefits -- how do I potentially evolve into 2019?\nLowell McAdam: Let's start with the 5G and enterprise; you're right, when we think about the eight different currencies that 5G is going to explore or we'll have -- I think that enterprise is the receiver [indiscernible] when it comes to latency, security, launched throughputs and all of that. We are in constant dialogue with our enterprise customers to see how we can build new type of services with them, and of course, we were building the Intelligent Edge Network and here we have the definition of Edge, how we do a specific slice for an enterprise, and that could be private 5G network with low latency or something like that. So we see that as a great opportunity, there are some features if I be little bit deep on technology that come out on the next revision of the N or 5G technology which is on the sick revision 16 [ph], that will be even more important for our enterprise customer. But again, we are building these as we speak and we have dialogue with all our enterprise customers to see that we are actually innovating together with them, new type of service where you sort of doing your real-time enterprise based on wireless which haven't been done before. So I think we are very far on our innovation and exploration in this area and I see great opportunities in it.\nMatthew Ellis: On your question around tax reform and certainly flowing through the cash flow and the capital allocation; look, the capital allocation we've talked about this numerous times and we are focused on being able to invest in the networks, providing a return to our shareholders, we know the dividend is important and we've increased the dividend for 11 years in a row now, and we've also said we want to strengthen the balance sheet and get back to those pre-Vodafone credit rating profile, and certainly tax reform helps accelerate our ability to do that, that's our focus for 2018. You saw good progress in the first half of the year, not just on the debt paydown but also -- when we say we strengthen the balance sheet we include what we did with the pension contribution as well; so we're making good progress there, too early to give specific views on 2019 but certainly as you know, tax reform will help us get to those leverage profile's quicker than we would have done otherwise and look forward to updating you on 2019 when we get closer to it.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Matt. Brad, we have time for one more question, let's go and take one more please.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Tim Hurrian [ph] of Oppenheimer.\nUnidentified Analyst: Do you still think you're going to be able to use wireless customer data in terms of location and usage to do more targeted advertising -- and if so, kind of the timing on that? And then secondly, it does seem like wireless and wireline networks are converging; I'm just curious, how do the unions kind of feel about this? Do you have the flexibility to kind of really converge these networks in a timely basis? Thank you.\nLowell McAdam: Okay Tim, thanks for the question, and I'd just say to all of you that asked questions today, thank you for your best wishes. First, on customer data, our hallmark on this Tim is transparency; we don't want to use data though -- unless customers know how we're using it. And so far we've been able to do a broad data analysis and target our advertising not based on individual customer data but overall data. And I think that anonymous usage -- we're very clear with customers about, and it's certainly got a lot of value to the old facets. On the convergence side, we're honoring the contract within the footprint and we're very open with the union about what we're doing, and we're very clear that areas that we manage outside of the union contract will stay clean as we go forward. So again, transparency is important to us, we think we can do exactly what we need to do without causing any footfalls and we're open about it; so we don't view that as a hindrance to our strategy going forward.\nBrady Connor: That's all the time we have for questions today. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Hans for some closing comments.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. And I would like to close this call with a few key points as I prepare to start my tenure as CEO of Verizon but I have to start by thanking Lowell for a fantastic journey and the fantastic job you have done, and you're going to be here in the transition and I'm really grateful for that. And yesterday like this when we're in the field, here in Houston, meeting employees, investors, we're meeting partners, and of course the city -- I think it shows the relationship you have built over the years, and handing that over to me and the team I think is enormous. So I have to chime-in [ph] towards everybody, as I said, it's a fantastic journey you've had Lowell. And coming back to the first half of 2018 where we've achieved solely financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace, and we are -- we're pleased where the business is positioned as we start the second half of the year. And we remain focused on the core strength of developing superior customer relationship and building the next-generation network for long-term growth, and I've talked about Intelligent Edge Network and the importance for our business, and I'm pleased to see where we're all with that. We're also committed to our strategy, and prior [ph] just led by investing in our network, leveraging the assets across all of Verizon, using platforms such as Oath to further monetize data and video consumption, maintaining disciplined capital allocation process and creating value for our customers and shareholders. We're confident in our ability to execute on our strategy, and we're positioned to take full advantage of the many opportunities that will take shape as we lead the evolution into 5G. As we say at Verizon, we don't wait for the future, we build it. Thank you for time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-04-24 13:29:05", "content": "Executives: Brady Connor - SVP, Investor Relations Matthew Ellis - EVP & CFO\nAnalysts: Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley Philip Cusick - JPMorgan Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs John Hodulik - UBS Michael Rollins - Citi David Barden - Bank of America Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson Jennifer Fritzsch - Wells Fargo Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Scott Goldman - Jefferies Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any questions, you may disconnect at this time It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are now available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. As of January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting standards that will impact the way we record certain transactions going forward, and some that will require recast of historical information. These new standards include ASC 606 for revenue recognition, changes related to the presentation of pension items on the income statement and updates for the cash flow reporting of restricted cash and collection of receivables with off-balance securitizations. We plan to recast the 2017 Form 10-K following the filing of our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q to address the adoption of the pension and cash flow reporting standards that require retrospective treatment. Before Matt goes to the results, I'd like to walk through a few items. For the first quarter 2018 we reported earnings of $1.11 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items I would like to highlight. Our reported first-quarter earnings include an early debt redemption charge of about $249 million and roughly $107 million of acquisition and integration costs primarily related to Oath. The net impact of these items after-tax was approximately $266 million, or $0.06 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.17 in the first quarter compared to $0.95 a year ago. Included in the differences approximately $0.21 due to the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard. On a comparable basis, adjusted earnings per share before the impacts of tax reform and revenue recognition was up 1.1% year-over- year. Next, I'd like to discuss the revenue recognition standard impact on our results. In order to provide additional clarity regarding the impact of the revenue recognition standard on our quarterly results, we have included the table on slide four that illustrates the effect across the business. The impact of the revenue recognition standard resulted in a reduction of wireless service revenue, offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue, as well as the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. For the remainder of this call, we will discuss results excluding the impact of the accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods unless otherwise noted. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Brady. Good morning, everyone and, thank you for joining us today. Let me start with a recap with our priorities of 2018 which we laid out earlier this year. We are laser focused on executing on the fundamentals, positioning the business of future growth and delivering sustainable financial performance for long-term value creation. We are enhancing our network leadership position, strengthening our customer relationships and driving efficiencies throughout the business. The cornerstone in our strategy is to provide customers with the best network and user experience. As reflected by our strong customer loyalty. We have again been recognized by RootMetrics as the best overall network outright for reliability, speed, data and co-performance for the ninth straight reporting period. As streaming video has become the primary driver of data usage, Verizon stands alone in providing the leading performance of video delivery. Recently, our wireless network was recognized by another third-party as having the best video success rate and the largest percentage of video streaming in high definition across the industry. Through our investments in spectrum, including millimeter wave, deployments within fiber network architecture and expansion of software defined networking capabilities, Verizon remains the clear leader in 4G and has the assets to provide the broadest, fastest and most advanced next generation network in the world. The demand for our fiber-based products continues to accelerate. And our Intelligent Edge Network design gives us the ability to meet customer needs of broadband to mobility services, an environment where quality of connection matters more now than ever before. In addition, the evolution of our Intelligent Edge Network architecture provides the flexibility and efficiencies to offer increased capacity and throughput, low latency, unmatched reliability and enhanced speeds. We have started the year with strong momentum and have delivered solid financial performance, including consolidated revenue growth, led by continued progress in the wireless business. It has now been a full year since we launched our original unlimited plans, and the offerings have evolved to provide value and choice for customers. We will continue to mold our compelling value proposition and provide the quality of network and user experience that customers demand. In an unlimited wireless world, we are driving revenue accretion thorough increase in the number of customer relationships and deepening the participation within our existing base by adding more devices and services. In addition, we are pre-positioned in the network to further enhance wireless growth opportunities with next generation technologies. Our 5G deployment is progressing as planned. We are quickly approaching the initial launch of our residential broadband service later this year, which will be the first use case of a broader 5G strategy. We are driving the ecosystem for future growth across the entire array of 5G services. With regard to our Oath business, we are deepening the engagement with our user base, creating opportunities for further monetization in the future. Consolidated EBITDA increased as we leveraged our scale into operational efficiencies thorough business excellence initiatives. Our disciplined capital allocation model allowed us to strengthen the business, while investing in our networks of future growth and long-term value creation. Let's dig deeper into the first quarter operating performance with a consolidated level, followed by Wireless and Wireline results and our Media and Telematics businesses. Now onto slide six. Consolidated revenue was $29.9 billion, excluding the impact of Oath and divested businesses, an increase of approximately 3.2%. The primary driver was solid performance in the Wireless business with improved service revenue results, as customers enjoyed unlimited access on the nation's best wireless network. We are on track to deliver low single digit percentage consolidated revenue growth on a reported basis for the full year 2018. On a consolidated basis excluding special items, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8%, which was down 70 basis points due to higher wireless equipment revenue and the inclusion of Yahoo in this year's results. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.5 billion due to steady improvement in operational efficiencies and increased penetration across our high quality customer base. With that, we are on track to realize low single digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS in 2018 before the impact of tax reform and revenue recognition. Let's turn now to slide seven, to review cash flow results and the balance sheet. In the first quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $6.6 billion, up $5.3 billion from last year. This was primarily driven by stronger operational results, lower discretionary pension contributions and as we have previously communicated, the reduction of working capital headwinds from the completion of the device payment plan portfolio transition from off-balance-sheet to on balance sheet financing. As part of our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet and providing financial flexibility to grow the business, we made a discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to improve the funded status of our pension plans. As a result, we do not project to have any mandatory pension contributions until approximately 2026. Total capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion over the prior year. We maintain our 2018 guidance range for capital expenditures of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be more evenly distributed throughout 2018 than in previous years. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up $3.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $119.1 billion of total debt, comprised of $109.0 billion of unsecured debt and $10.1 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Total debt was up $2.5 billion year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in our asset-backed borrowings of $3.8 billion. The total debt balance is expected to decline as we begin to realize that cash benefits of tax reform later this year. Now, let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with Wireless on slide eight. Total Wireless operating revenue increased 4.7% to $21.9 billion in the first quarter. Service revenue performance produced solid results in the quarter driven by customer step ups to higher access plans. The quality of our overall customer experience and value proposition, as well as our measured approach to promotional activity in a highly competitive environment. On May 8th of last year, we used a chart on the lower half of the slide to communicate the impact of unlimited on service revenue trajectory and our expectations for future trends to improve. We are pleased to report that service revenues for the quarter was flat versus the prior year. We saw year-over-year improvement throughout the quarter with service revenue turning positive in the month of March. We now have 81% of our post-paid phone base on unsubsidized plans compared to 72% for the same period last year. On a reported basis, including the revenue recognition standard, service revenue was down 2.4%. We expect the momentum in the service revenue trajectory to continue and we are on track for growth to turn positive on a reported basis around the end of the year. Equipment revenue increased 22.1% driven by the mix of higher priced handsets and increased activations. Approximately 49% of post-paid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter, similar to last year. Our Wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.3%. This represents an improvement of 120 basis points driven by the strength of our service revenue results and ongoing focus on operational excellence throughout the business. Let's now turn to slide nine and take a closer look at Wireless operating metrics. First quarter is seasonally the lowest volume period of the year coming off with a holiday retail season. Overall, we gained 260,000 post-paid net ads, consisting of phone losses of 24,000 and tablet losses of 75,000, offset by 359,000 other connected devices primarily wearables. Smartphone net additions to the quarter were 220,000, as customers looked to connect their sophisticated devices to the best wireless network in the U.S. Our unlimited offerings continue to provide a compelling value and overall customer experience that has led to post-paid phone churn of 0.80% for the quarter. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of customer attention at 0.80% or better. Total retail post-paid churn of 1.04% decreased year-over-year. Total post-paid device activations were 2.3% higher than the prior year of which about 80% were phones. In a seasonally low, we had 5.0% of our retail post-paid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.2%. During the quarter, 77% of phone activations were on device payment plans. Prepaid activity in the quarter reflected a total net loss of 335,000 devices, of which 261 where basic phone losses. Let's move next to our Wireline segment on slide 10. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment decreased 1.8% for the quarter, as growth from our high quality fiber-based products was more than offset by secular pressures from legacy technology shifts, trends from cord cutting and pricing pressures in a highly competitive environment. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.7% primarily driven by legacy core revenue declines. Fios consumer revenue increased 1.2% driven by the growing demand for high quality broadband service. The mix shift away from triple-play bundles pressured revenue trends, but the margin impact was largely offset by the corresponding reduction in content expenditures. We added 66,000 Fios Internet customers on the strength of our high speed fiber offerings, as customers seek the best broadband experience. Fios Video losses of 22,000 were indicative of a continued secular trend for cord cutting on the traditional linear video bundle. Excluding the XO acquisition, enterprise solutions revenue decreased 4.2% in the quarter, driven primarily by declines in legacy products and pricing pressure in the market that more than offset growth in demand for fiber based services. On a constant currency basis, the year-over-year decline was 5.7%. Partner solutions revenue decreased 0.4% with our XO. We see fiber demand as the main driver for future growth opportunities within this segment. In business markets revenue declined 5.7% [ph] without XO. We have good trajectory with our fiber based services, but these are offset by declines in legacy products. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 20.4%. We continue to benefit from operational efficiency gains, but steady increases in content cost and secular pressures within legacy technologies remain headwinds. Let's now move on to slide 11 to discuss our Media and IoT businesses. The integration of the Oath assets is progressing well. Accelerating our mobile first strategy and positioning us at global reach and future growth in premium content distribution and programmatic advertising capabilities across our key verticals. As expected, Oath gross revenue decreased sequentially about 13% from the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion due to seasonally lower display advertising volumes. Our organizational integration was largely completed in 2017, and the focus in 2018 has now shifted to streamlining platforms and products, unlocking cost and revenue synergies on the way. During the quarter, we achieved a full integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo video supply-side platforms into a unified platform and go-to-market strategy. This positions the business of future growth, as we establish our role as a value added partner for advertising customers. In the Telematics business, as part of the ongoing integration of the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions, we have created the new Verizon Connect organization. Total Verizon Connect revenue was $234 million in the first quarter. Total IoT revenue, including Verizon Connect was up approximately 13%. Let's now move to slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy of laying the foundation for future growth, while maintaining a strong leadership position in 4G LTE coverage, reliability and capacity. The execution model remains unchanged in terms of delivering strong financial results, allocating capitol to position the business for future growth, while strengthening our balance sheet and returning long-term value to our shareholders. Our Wireless value proposition is allowing more and more customers to experience unlimited service on the best network in the United States. We exited the quarter with strong momentum and produced operational and financial performance in a highly competitive environment, while investing in all our businesses and driving cost efficiencies. Last year we announced our goal to drive $10 billion in cumulative cash savings throughout the business over the next four years. Our business excellence initiative, which includes implementing zero-based budgeting has already yielded positive results in the first quarter, realizing approximately $200 million of savings thorough process improvements, work streamlining and automation. The program is on track to deliver against our goals over the four year period. In addition to the operational improvements in the business, the benefits from corporate tax reform will be realized throughout the remainder of the year, which will provide additional flexibility and enable us to execute on our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet. We are pre-positioning our networks as fiber infrastructure, spectrum resources, and the rollout with our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network architecture. We are excited about the initial commercial launch in our 5G residential broadband offering later this year, as the first slice of a multi-use asset. We are on the forefront of innovation that will drive the full suite of services and used cases that will be delivered by 5G technologies. We have successfully completed our 11 city 5G pre-commercial trials where we demonstrated propagation over 2000 feet from the node on millimeter wave spectrum. We have moved into the commercial deployment phase for the residential broadband launch in the second half of this year. Deployment of commercial nodes on our own fiber asset is underway in the initial markets. And earlier this month, we performed successful end-to-end 5G data sessions in these locations using commercial equipment that will be deployed from the launch later this year. The ecosystem for 5G is progressing with advancements being realized around global standards and technology developments. Progress is being made at the state and city level to drive sustainable economics around sell-side deployment, creating the pathway to better serving in their communities. Millimeter wave spectrum enables a whole new array of services that will be delivered through ultra-wideband 5G technologies. We are well-positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities that 5G has to offer. With that, I will turn the call back over to Brady, so we can get to your questions.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Matt. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer section. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead\nSimon Flannery: Thanks a lot. Good morning, Matt. I wanted to follow up on the 5G broadband rollout. When do you think you'll give us more visibility about the three to five markets, the timeline around when you're rolling that out, how many homes? And then related questions, I think you said pre-standards. When do you think the standards-based CPE will be available so you can really scale this? And then finally, what's your video strategy here? Are you going to have an OTT offering to the bundle with the broadband product? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Good morning, Simon. Thank you for the question.\nSimon Flannery: Morning\u2026\nMatthew Ellis: So in terms of the timeline for the three to five markets, as we said earlier this year, and when we made the announcement in November 29, those - all of those markets will launch in the second half of this year. So we announced at Sacramento will be one of those cities and the other cities will announce as we get closer to launch date. But we are very much on track with being in a position to launch each of those cities later this year. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are in the process of deploying assets in each of those markets and look forward to bringing that service to consumers in those markets in 2018. As you mentioned, the launch this year will be on our proprietary standard, and this gives us the opportunity to get a product out in the market before others and to demonstrate that millimeter wave does exactly the things that we said it does. But obviously over time, we want to move to the standards-based CPE, and we expect to be getting that CPE based off of the NR standard, probably in 2019. Look, what I would I say is the network is being pre-positioned to be able to launch 5G as soon as customer equipment is ready, whether that be in-home CPE for residential broadband or weather that be handsets with 5G mobility. We'll be ready as soon as equipment is ready on the global standard. And in your final question was around a video strategy for the residential broadband launch. So that's - we've got that underway. We continue to look OTT options, and as we've said previously, we're not looking to launch a need to product, but certainly expect to have an overall product offering to consumers in those three to five markets that will be compelling to meet their needs\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Brad, I think we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: I wonder if I can follow up first on my question from January about your target leverage. Has the Company come up with a way to think about leverage under the new tax regime, especially with no cash pension obligations for the next eight years?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So Phil, we continue to look at the - our goal to improve leverage. And really to get back to that pre-Vodafone credit raiding and we've had plenty of conversations at the rating agencies around that and how our leverage looks in a post- tax reform world. But look, we're in a great position as we demonstrated this quarter. We grew the EBITDA side of the business. And then as we talked about as the benefits of tax reform from a cash basis later this year, we'll see improvements in the debt side of it. So we're on track to improve the leverage and look forward to - not too distant future as we're having that conversation with the agencies about the timing of being in a position to get us back to where we want. But I think if you look historically where our leverage ratios were on an adjusted basis, when you adjust for the sellco ownership, you have a fair idea of where we're trying to get to. So there is a few points of turn to go, but not a massive amount.\nPhilip Cusick: Okay. And if I can follow up on Simon's question as well. As some carriers and vendors are pulling back from 5G. How has Verizon's thinking evolved in 5G this year? Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. We continue to be very excited about the opportunities that 5G has. I don't think in the U.S. we've seen people pulling back from 5G at all. In fact, I think you have seen a lot of very bullish commentary. So we will be launching the residential broadband later this year. We're on track with that. Certainly happy to have the assets in place to do that, whether that be - what we've done with the network over the past few years, as we have densified the network, putting more fiber out there, which really pre-positions us to deploy 5G, gaining the 28 and 39 gigahertz spectrum that puts us in a position to be ready to deploy when the equipment ready from the OEM. So we are very bullish about 5G. We think there's tremendous upside, whether that be residential broadband, whether it be mobility. Really the most exciting pieces as you get into the new use cases that don't exist on the current technologies around IoT, B2B type applications. So we are full steam ahead on our 5G deployment.\nPhilip Cusick: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we're ready for the next question\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. I'm actually going to follow up on what you were just discussing. When we talk to investors about 5G and we talk about the fixed use case, I think they all understand the addressable market and it's just a matter of how effective the product is going to be. But when we talk about mobility - and, as you noted, many of these use cases don't exist yet - are you comfortable accelerating capital investment into developing a mobile 5G network without visibility on those use cases? And if not, is there going to be a point where we might see an inflection in CapEx higher where you see that forming?\nMatthew Ellis: Good morning, Brett. So I don't see us having a massive acceleration in CapEx. As you heard, we reiterated our guidance for 2018. That guidance of 170 to 178 [ph] is the same range of actual spending we've had over the past four years. So what investors should have grown accustomed to seeing for Verizon is consistent total capital spend on a disciplined methodical manner. But the items within that spend evolve over time as the technologies evolve. So this year we've already started spend on 5G. The spend on those three to five initial launch city's began earlier this year, so that's ongoing. You should expect to see spend in additional cities be underway by the end of the year, so that we're in a position to launch additional geographies in 2019. But that's within our current CapEx guidance. And as we look forward, we continue to believe that we can deploy the network within the typical range. If we see an opportunity to accelerate because of the market, we're not afraid to do so, but it will be based off of the opportunity we have in the marketplace. But this really comes back to the design of the network over the past few years, by identifying the 4G network we've put a lot of the infrastructure in place that we need to deploy 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum. So we don't see this as being a massive uptick. This is not the same thing as when we adopted 4G and went from a CDMA based 3G network to the 4G LTE network. This is a very different network rollout. And I think you will see that in the CapEx as we go forward. So look, as you mentioned the different revenue buckets. We're very comfortable that certainly the mobility bucket gives us the opportunity to deepen our relationship with our existing customer base and look to grow that base. Residential broadband is an existing market that we have opportunity to grow share in. And then the new use cases at lower latency and higher throughputs and the ability to connect many, many more device is to each individual node will create significant upside as well. But this is a multi-use asset that we think will have a strong return over time.\nBrett Feldman: And just to be clear, your comment about capital intensity during your 5G upgrade, you were referring to both the fixed and mobile components of it? That was not unique to the fixed employment?\nMatthew Ellis: It's the same deployment. I mean, we are not building a 5G network for residential broadband and a different 5G network for mobility. We are deploying a 5G network that will have multiple revenue streams off of it. So we're very excited about the ability to do that. And in addition to have a multiple revenue streams, we are using a lot of existing assets we have in the field already today.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nBrady Connor: Brad, let's take the next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, thanks. Matt, obviously a lot of changes going on in the media space. And one of your largest competitors, AT&T, is investing in traditional media assets while you guys have focused more on new media platforms. Are you seeing anything that would change your view on that approach or any value created by combining through your distribution assets with what you see in the traditional media world? And has your guys' thinking on that evolved over time? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. I mean, certainly it has evolved over time, but it is very consistent with what we've said earlier this year, at this point in time as we look at the ecosystem, we're very comfortable with the approach of making sure we have distribution rights to digital content. And you saw that with the NFL deal, the NPA deal, and I would expect to see us continue to add to that portfolio of digital rights, to distribute across various Yahoo platforms, other platforms as we go forward. So look the content space is evolving rapidly. And we think the best approach for us at this point in time is to be the independent distributor of rights out there. And we're very comfortable that we will be very effective doing that. So, no major change in terms of our approach from when we spoke on the earnings call 90 days ago.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, but just a quick follow-up. But the possibility of you guys making a more profound investment in traditional media assets like networks, whether they be cable networks or broadcast networks, should we think of that is still off the table or subject to change as we see things evolve in the media landscape?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. I would certainly say not at this time. When we look at the landscape out there, its evolving very fast. And I am not going to say never on anything, but I look at it right now in a foreseeable future, I don't see that being the right time to jump in. So we are pursuing the strategy that we've discussed. We're going to continue to add content to the Oath platforms, bring some of that content across our other distribution, whether that's wireless or Fios and we think there is significant runway to that strategy and we'll continue to monitor the broader ecosystem.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Brad, let's take the next question please.\nOperator: Your question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. First, just cost-cutting that the $10 billion program generated about $200 million so far. Can you discuss the pacing of cost-cutting prospects for the balance of 2018? And also it's been you know, about a year since [Technical Difficulty] unlimited. Can you discus what the current consumption of data traffic [Technical Difficulty] smartphone and how you keep [Technical Difficulty]?\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, Mike, you are breaking up the last part of that question. I think you are talking about unlimited and data consumption. Can you clarify the back part?\nMichael Rollins: Yes, if you could just talk about the consumption of smart phone users and how it's impacting network quality.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah, absolutely. So look, I will tell you we have seen significant increase in data usage. As we move to unlimited, as expected. We also saw a change in where that usage was taking place, as the busy hour of the day changed, and also the geography where that changed. So we've seen that increase level off. We are still seeing year-over-year increases, but not the same levels that we saw after we launched unlimited. And it's got back to more normal growth rates. But you asked about what we're seeing in terms of quality across the network. And I just come back to all of the own data that we use ourselves from testing our network and others out there and what we see from third parties. And our network continues to be the standard by which all others are measured. And that has continued to be the case even after we launched a 5G. So when we launched 5G we said that we had spent a good amount of time making sure that the network was ready for it. I believe the performance over the past 12 months has demonstrated the fantastic job that our network team has done, meaning, as we moved into an unlimited world and we saw data usage increase, we continued to deliver the high quality of service that people expect from us. So I expect that to fully continue. But the network is performing incredibly well and we continue to add capacity. And so we're in great shape there. Your first question around cost cutting. So 200 million approximately so far this year. As we continue to move forward, will have additional savings kick in as well. Certainly the ones that require deeper amount of process change will come in later in the quarter of the program than some of the other ones. But we - you should see it more back end loaded. I think it will be reasonably even throughout '18 and then you will see some of the structural changes kick into a greater degree over the back half of the four-year program. But we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far, but we really just started and there's a long way to go.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nBrady Connor: Brad, let's take the next question please\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first one, just another cadence question, Matt. I guess last quarter you gave us the heads up about the seasonal weakness in the Oath business in the first quarter. And I think relative to wireless EBITDA outperformance and wireline EBITDA kind of in line, it seems like Oath and related corporate initiatives were maybe a little bit of a weak spot. Could you paint the picture for how that relatively sizable segment now might track over the course of the rest of 2018? And I guess the second question would be related to the business market related aspects of tax reform. Have you been able to see any economic effect on your business, business as a result of tax reform, kind of those conversations changing kind of the outlook brightening? Anything related to that would be helpful. Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. Good morning, So Look, I'd like to tell you, I have seen a significant change in the level of demand from our enterprise customers. But look it's really too early. I think if we look at it from our own IT department, they were not immediate because we got tax reform turning around and doing significant changes in their IT spend and their telco spend. So we'll see if that picks up as the year goes on, but nothing significant in the trajectory so far in that group. In terms of the cadence through the year, I think we said on the last call that we expected Oath to be down seasonally or sequentially from 4Q to 1Q just with the seasonal change in advertising volumes, and we certainly saw that, the results came in as we expected. So really from this point forward, we should expect to see a sequential improvement from what we saw in the first quarter, really for two reasons. One, you just got the seasonality impact that builds throughout the year. And then secondly, we're getting the underlying platforms integrated between the legacy AOL, the legacy Yahoo platforms. And so when advertisers come into our business going forward, they can come in thorough one platform rather than the multiple platforms they come through today. So as we get the rest of that integration work completed, it will make us easier to do business with them, we think that will show up in the results. But that's an ongoing exercise, and I don't think we'll really start to see that until really the back end of the year. And so as we head into '19 where the momentum should be significantly different than it is today. So hopefully that gives you a little insight there.\nDavid Barden: Thanks, Matt. And if I could just do one quick follow-up, maybe related to John's question on media appetite. As you knit these two businesses together, the idea was to have the third biggest scale digital media platform in the world maybe. And do you feel like you've accomplished that goal and that you're getting the benefits of that scale? Or is incremental scale something that's necessary to really get you to the next level?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. We have the scale today. That was why the Yahoo acquisition made so much sense. It got us to around a billion monthly active users. So now the challenge for the business is to deepen the relationship with those customers. Look, if we grow the number of monthly active users, that's great. I'd be very happy to do so. But the biggest opportunity for us is to deepen the relationship we have with those consumers. We do that by bringing additional compelling content such as NFL, NPA across those assets. And you saw what we did with those properties, and more to come there. And then once you use content like that to get them on the platform, you have other content there that keeps them on the platform. And when we keep them on the platform, that gives us the opportunity to increase the attractiveness to our advertising partners. So you will see us focused on increasing the engagement with the base that we have, but we have the scale that we need to be successful in that business.\nDavid Barden: Great. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Matt, I know you talked about not a strong level of interest in media, but it was widely reported that you at least looked at it and put in a bid for the Fox asset. So I guess if I think about assets that are for sale, you are at least looking at Fox. It sounds as though there's maybe some spectrum coming from - whether Intelsat or Dish Network always out there. And then you've also talked about your balance sheet objectives. Can you roll all that up for us and talk about how your priorities - how you would rank your priorities across spectrum, other operating assets or balance sheet reductions? And then - and just one quick nuance in that, your Fox bid was reportedly all stock. Would that suggest that you would not be willing to add leverage for a big acquisition?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. So, good morning, Craig. Look, I'm not going to comment on any specific M&A rumors. That's not been our policy and I'm not going to start now. But let's talk about content in M&A in general. So I have commented already this morning that we've certainly are comfortable with the approach that we have around content across the Oath platforms and other parts of our business. And we are very focused on executing against that. M&A to us is tool to help execute our strategy. If M&A allows us to accelerate the execution of our strategy at a value that provides a return, is something we look at. But it has to be consistent with the strategy and it has to have value. We don't operate in a vacuum. Lowell and I have to be aware of activity and opportunities around us and we have an obligation to make sure we understand those. So we keep an eye on everything going on in the ecosystem. But when we do M&A, it's because it fits with the strategy. And if you look at the past year, the only significant transactions we did, whether Yahoo, XO and Straight Path, they very clearly accelerate our strategy, whether that be around adding the necessary scale to our media assets as we just talked about just a couple of minutes ago, or pre-positioning our networks for being continuing the excellence in 4G world and also being in a position to succeed in 5G, whether that's adding fiber through XO or adding the spectrum assets through XO and Straight Path. We put ourselves in a position where we are in a - where we can execute our strategy and compete and generate value for shareholders over the long-term. So I wouldn't necessarily want to prioritize what's the most interesting thing for us to look at. We are very comfortable executing our strategy on a mostly organic basis, if the right opportunities come up, we take a look at them. The vast majority of things we look at don't create value and therefore we pass on them because that's the responsible thing to do to create long-term value. The strength in the balance sheet is important to us. The position in the business for long-term future growth that creates value for shareholders is also very important. And I think we've balanced those things very well over the past few years, and I expect to continue to do so\nCraig Moffett: That's very clear. Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJennifer Fritzsch: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. Just on the service revenue guidance, you achieved it excluding the new accounting recognition ahead of schedule and I guess two questions. Why the guidance still for midyear? Could you continue to see it in the second quarter? And then secondly, is Comcast MVNO service revenue included in that line? I think some are wondering if that's why we hit it ahead of schedule. Thanks\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. So let me answer the last one first there. I mean, yes, certainly our service revenue includes all service revenues related to connectivity to our network, whether that be our post-paid, whether that be prepaid, or MVNO. Those service revenues that we generate from operating the network. But I would not so say that any of those pieces fit them. And within the wholesale side of our business, in addition to the MSOs obviously TracFone's there by far the biggest part of that business for us to date. But look, when you look at why we got there this quarter, I think it's predominately because of our post-paid business continues to do well. You see continued to add 220,000 smartphones. The network continues to perform well, churn is very low, and that is driving the service revenue trajectory. As we described last year, we continued to add connections to our account, continue to deepen the relationship with our base, and that allows us to continue to grow the post-paid component of service revenue.\nJennifer Fritzsch: Great. Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much. And good morning, folks. I was wondering if I could build upon Jennifer's prior question in terms of thinking about the cable operators. If we think about your guidance, what is your expectation around competition from the cable folks with regards to their wireless services? And any sort of potential while reciprocal competition that may come from some of the incumbent players? Just trying to get your understanding of the lay of the competitive landscape over the next several quarters as some of these services ramp.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So look, as these services have started, it's pretty much been as expected in terms of the volumes that we've seen. So I would expect there to be continued competition in the marketplace. I think some of the activity you saw in the first quarter is a result of that, and I think that you saw we had a disciplined approach to that activity in the quarter. And you should expect that to continue. We will be very focused on maintaining our high quality base of customers, and we will do the things that we need to in a responsible fashion to do so. But look, anytime you add the additional players to the space, that has the opportunity to increase competitiveness, but that's baked into our plans for the year. In the grand scheme of overall volumes, the amounts of activity coming from the new in MVNO's is still relatively small and we would expect it to be that way. But look, as they get traction that will bring in more traffic to our network that we can monetize as well. So we're happy with that side of the equation too.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thanks, very much Matt. And then, if I may, a quick follow-up in thinking about your 5G strategy. You folks have laid out a case in terms of the millimeter wave solution ramping better than anticipated from a tech perspective. And clearly your multiuse fiber infrastructure is creating a foundational layer to upgrade with lower capital intensity or without the requirement for accelerated capital intensity. But how should we think about mobility? Is there a need for a coverage layer of spectrum - an additional layer of spectrum in order to launch 5G from a mobility standpoint? And given some of the options available, whether it is 3.5 or any other option available, how should we think about your strategy to deploy mobility on 5G?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. So, thanks. We can launch 5G mobility on our existing assets. And - but as we look forward, we have over our history continue to add spectrum to our overall portfolio. If there's opportunities to do so at a reasonable price, we would certainly do so again. But we are comfortable that we can launch 5G mobility with the assets we have. 5G mobility will be initially very much heavily focused on urban areas. And we have the assets in place there, and we will be ready to launch that as soon the OEMs of handsets available with 5G chipsets in them.\nAmir Rozwadowski: Thank you very much for giving the multi-color.\nBrady Connor: Thanks. Brad, we're ready for the next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Goldman of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nScott Goldman: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up to that question and one earlier as well. Matt, as you look at - you've talked a lot in the past about your ability to meet capacity with the spectrum you have, as well as the incremental tools around MIMO and 256 QAM and so forth. But it looks as though we are heading for a couple years of maybe a few auctions coming out of the FCC in terms of millimeter wave, the CBRS, the C band. Can you just talk about your potential level of interest in acquiring more millimeter wave on top of what you have already acquired through Straight Path and XO or perhaps those lower 3 GHz plus bands there? And then just a follow-up on a question earlier. You talked a bit about the trajectory of Oath from a revenue perspective going forward and a bit about the scale there. Just wondering how we should think about what the margin profile of that revenue looks like both in 2018 and perhaps as you get two or three years out into that business. Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Scott. So look, we have participated in numerous spectrum auctions over the years. And there is also been auctions that we've either chosen not to participate in or that we have participated only in certain areas, such as the AWS [indiscernible] auction. We are very comfortable with the spectrum assets that we own as we move into the 5G world. But at the right price, spectrum is interesting. But as you've seen on 4G, there are multiple ways for us to add capacity to our network. And weather that be densification, whether that be more spectrum or weather that be deploying the evolving technologies, we take advantage of all of those things, and we look to add capacity. And overall, the service that our customers get, at the cheapest possible way, and over time that's evolved. But we will certainly take a look at any auction that comes up, and if it makes sense for us to participate, we will. And if it doesn't, then we'll - we have other avenues to continue to deploy our networks and meet the needs of our consumers. On Oath, as you talk about the margin profile there, as they add to the revenue base, we should see the margin profile of that business improve, certainly in the latter part of this year, and then as you get into '19 and '20. But the capital intensity of that business is very different from our network businesses. And so you should expect a different margin profile there, certainly lower than you see within wireless. But when you net out the lower capital intensity with the margin profile, the intent is to certainly have a compelling return on investment.\nScott Goldman: Great. Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Hey Brad, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last question is from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Securities. You may go ahead.\nMike McCormack: Hey, guys. Thanks. Matt, just maybe a couple of follow-ups here. With respect to the competitive landscape, I know obviously you want to maintain your best customers, but what's the overall philosophy on positive handset adds? How important is that you Verizon? And as you think about the next few quarters coming up, the appetite for you guys to get perhaps more promotional to get back to positive on that? On the cable wireless stuff, and maybe you can't share much, but any sort of early takeaways on the type of customers that are opting into that? And anything you can share with respect to usage patterns would be great? Thanks,\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Mike. Look on the cable - the type of customers, I don't think we're seeing anything particular there in terms of being one type of customer or another. But I'll let the cable guys give you more color on that as they see fit. The usage that we're seeing from those customers is as expected. So you know, nothing significantly different from what we see from the rest of that base. You asked about the competitive landscape, and look, so we had 220,000 positive smartphone adds. Phones overall were slightly negative, but that's not unusual for first quarter. We've seen that the past few years and I think when you see the year as a whole, you see that become positive as momentum builds through the year. I see no reason to believe that this year will be any different. We will be measured and disciplined in terms of our promotional response to the marketplace. But we've been very successful at maintaining our base. You see the churn numbers again very strong four quarters in a row at 0.80 or better. So we are maintaining that base. We deepen our relationship with our base in terms of the number of connections. And then we certainly look to add new accounts. And I think we've been successful doing that. We have more accounts now than we had a year ago. And when you are increasing the number of accounts and you're increasing the connectivity with existing accounts, that's a good approach and we will continue to be focused on doing that and growing revenues and growing margins. So that nothing really changes in 2018 as we think about how we're going to approach the wireless market.\nMike McCormack: Matt, I'm sorry, just a quick follow-up on that percentage of customers that are on unsubsidized versus those that are making a phone payment, that delta continues to be pretty wide. But can you just give us a sense for how much of that is bring your own device versus proactive retention versus phones that are paid off?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. Look, as you see the elongation in the ownership cycle, you're going to see that - you know, the fact we have 81% of the base on unsubsidized pricing, but only about 49% have an active loan. As people pay off the device and they keep their devices longer than just two years, I expect you know to see that delta in that number. We've seen some level of BYOD, but that has leveled off over the past couple of quarters but we expect that to continue to be part of that delta as well. But it's actually been a pretty stable relationship over the past two or three quarters as we've largely completed the transition of the base from subsidy to the device payment model.\nMike McCormack: Great. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it over to Matt for some closing comments.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. During the first quarter we achieved solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We started the year with strong momentum in our business and expect the trend to continue as we progress throughout the year. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a discipline capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders. We are positioning the company for long-term growth and taking advantage of the full array of opportunities in the 5G era, which is now upon us as we move into the next cycle of growth in the industry. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and focused on building the best network for the future to produce long-term value. Thank you, for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."}], "2020": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-30 13:36:14", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been pleased in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. In addition to our comments today, on February 13, Verizon will be hosting an Investor Day in New York City and will be webcasting presentations by Hans and the leadership team. More information about the event will be posted on our IR website. As a reminder we're in the middle of a millimeter wave spectrum auction so we will not be able to comment on our current millimeter wave spectrum holdings or strategy.  Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.23 per share resulting in full year earnings of $4.65 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a net pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $2.4 billion including an early debt extinguishment charge of $2.1 billion; an impairment charge of $236 million primarily related to the write-down of goodwill within our media business; and a net charge related to severance and annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities of $135 million. In addition, we recorded a $2.2 billion tax benefit related to the sale of preferred shares in a foreign affiliate. The cash impact related to the tax benefit of this sale will be realized in 2020. Excluding the effects of these special items adjusted earnings per share was $1.13 in the fourth quarter up 0.9% compared to $1.12 a year ago. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $4.81 up 2.1% compared to $4.71 a year ago. Let's now move to slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition and ASC 842 for leases continued throughout 2019. As we illustrated in previous quarters we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.03 for the fourth quarter and $0.12 for the full year. For 2020, we expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09. In addition to ASC 606, accounting standard ASC 842 for leases which was implemented at the beginning of 2019 results in a gross up on the balance sheet for all operating leases. This new leasing standard affects our earnings per share primarily due to the expensing of certain upfront lease costs creating a headwind of $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.05 for the full year. We do not expect a year-over-year impact from the lease standard in 2020. Full year adjusted EPS growth of 2.1% illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide reflects strong underlying performance of the business, partially offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense and the adoption of the leasing standard. Additional details of our quarterly performance will be covered by Matt later in this call. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2019 and a discussion of our strategic priorities for 2020.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and thank you, everyone, for joining this fourth quarter earnings call. Let me summarize quickly a little bit everything we have done in 2019, which is building a great fundamental for 2020. The transformation was built on a network, process changes, brand changes, go-to-market changes and of course, also a lot of new talent coming into our team, all that we\u2019re doing during 2019.  We've fortified our network with new architecture. We had a lot of process changes with a voluntary program. We rebranded and put one brand for everything we're doing in the company. We made a new go-to-market, including new management teams. That has been a big change in the company that is solidifying our way of accessing the market an even better way in 2020. So all that's happening, we continue to actually execute well on our day-to-day business. Our network continues to be the best in the market. We just had new confirmation from J.D. Power, RootMetrics that again our network, our 4G network is clearly the best in the market. Very happy with the team that they keep up that work. The other thing that we have been very focused on is of course to continue to lead the market in wireless and for consumers. And here we're seeing Ronan Dunne and his team continue with a good pacing. Unlimited came out with new offerings seeing that our customer getting optionality, optionality when it comes to the wireless offering, but also on the cable side within mix and match that we came out with earlier this year. We also added in a lot of partnership as we now have network service as a strategy. We added in the Apple Music and more lately, of course, we included with Disney+. Both of them has been a win-win for both our partners, for our customers, and for Verizon. And this is the strategy we want to have going forward. On the business side, we also did a lot of important partnerships where we had the same model. I think about the partnership with for example AWS Amazon on the 5G mobile edge compute, again, a totally new way of accessing a market that we have not been into. And speaking about 5G, we had our commitment 30 cities. We made 31. We said we're going to launch 5G Home with the NR standard. We did that and we said we're going to launch the first 5G mobile edge compute. We did that in Chicago in December. So all-in-all, a year with so much execution and at the same time we continue to achieve what we want to do. And we round that up with our financials in the year-end operational metrics. I'm really happy to report that, we had our best year since 2013 when it comes to phone net adds, a growth of 28% year-over-year. And again, that is how our team has been working with a new model. And on the financial side, we continue to see that we had a good wireless service revenue over the year with 3.2% for the full year, which is the highest since 2014. And when it comes to our profitability, our EPS was up 2.1% within 2019 for the full year. And we continue to create strong cash flow, which is of course, giving us the flexibility going forward to see that we can execute on our strategy. Ultimately, consumer group continued to have a very good year in 2019 with everything they're doing. The Verizon business group have of course the headwinds when it comes to the secular decline in the wireline side, at the same time as we're investing more in that area. We're investing in processes, tools and structures. And why is that important? It's so important, because this is one of the greatest opportunities for growth for us, when it comes to 5G and how we address the market. And I can tell you during 2019, I met so many large corporations that we now can actually work with, because our offering is so strong when it comes to fiber and 5G. But we need to put that structure in place for the Verizon business group in order for them to actually both execute on the revenue side, but also on the cost side. And that's really what we're focused on. Ultimately, I think we have created a very strong fundamental for going into 2020. And if you think about our priorities for 2020, first of all, continue to grow on the core business. I mean, we showed this year we can continue to grow 4G and our core businesses and that we'll continue to do in 2020 as well, including building our network to be the best network in this market. Secondly is leveraging our new assets that we're building. We're building on fiber. We're building our 5G and seeing that we can start leveraging that with our customer. And I think that this year, we'll continue to have a lot of focus on our 5G build and what we're doing in 5G, and we will come back to that later on how we see the 5G market when we will have an Investor Day later in February. So the third priority in 2020 is around our financials and our discipline there. And the ambition is to accelerate the growth in revenue and EPS in 2020, and continue to create strong cash flow as we did in 2019. But it's also to continue to have the discipline and efficiency in our CapEx and OpEx spend. That's very important, because this is really driving us going forward being able to execute on our strategy. And the four priorities around our customer centricity and our purpose-driven company, both are very important to engage with all our stakeholders, if it's the society, our employees or customers to have that in our genes in the company every day. Here we will drive a lot around thinking about the customers, giving them optionality as we did in 2019, we will just continue to do that. And when it comes to our responsibility, to drive a responsible business, we laid out a lot of things in 2019 what we want to do and combine our responsibility of our society with our strategy. We think that is strengthening us as a company to all our stakeholders. And ultimately that will create even more value for all our stakeholders. So all-in-all, I think we have a really good platform coming into 2020. We are excited for it, and we hope that all of you are excited for 2020 as well. So by that, I hand over to Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. We will begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.8 billion, up 1.4%. Service revenue remains the primary driver of growth driven by volumes and step-ups in access, partially offset by lower wireless equipment revenue. And secular declines in revenue from our wireline products and services, predominantly in our business segment. At the beginning of the year, we provided consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage revenue growth for 2019. For the year, total revenue grew 0.8% including a 3.1% decline, in wireless equipment revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.1 billion, as compared to $11.6 billion last year. The headwinds mentioned earlier from the deferral of commission expense. And the lease accounting standard lowered EBITDA by $239 million, which is approximately a 70 basis point impact on EBITDA margin in the quarter. These results reflect continued strong margin performance in consumer, despite a meaningful increase in volumes. And secular weakness in the wireline portion of the business segment. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.2 billion. And EBITDA margin was 35.8%, slightly lower than last year's margin of 36.2%. Full year adjusted EBITDA included headwinds of approximately 70 basis points, from the deferral of commission expense, and the lease accounting standard which overshadowed our improved operational performance in 2019. Through our Business Excellence program, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $5.7 billion and are on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021. The Voluntary Separation Program resulted in approximately $1.3 billion of expense savings this year. And we have been at our full run rate of savings for the last two quarters of the year. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.13, up 0.9% from $1.12 a year ago. We achieved our 2019 goal of low single-digit growth by posting a full year adjusted EPS of $4.81, representing a yearly growth rate of 2.1%, including the $0.17 headwind related to ASC 606 and ASC 842, that Brady mentioned earlier. Let's now turn to cash flow results on slide 8. We had strong cash flows in 2019, which allowed us to continue our focus on investing in our networks, increasing our dividend for the 13th straight year and strengthen the balance sheet. The year-over-year increase in CFFO was due to operational improvements and lower discretionary employee benefit contributions, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. And payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. Capital expenditures for 2019 totaled $17.9 billion. And well within our guided range of $17 billion to $18 billion. Capital spending for the year was driven primarily by our fiber deployment in 60-plus markets, outside of our ILEC footprint and the build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. Additionally, we continue to support growth in data and video traffic, on our industry-leading 4G LTE network and the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture. Free cash flow for the year was $17.8 billion up, 0.7% year-over-year. Our balance sheet continued to strengthen with our net unsecured debt down $3.7 billion year-over-year. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio rounds down to 2.0 times versus our targeted range of 1.75 times to 2.0 times. We remain focused on reducing our secured debt portfolio into our targeted range, while continuing to actively manage our near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital. As part of this management of the balance sheet, we conducted liability management transactions in the quarter. And throughout the year which will reduce our interest expense going forward. Now, let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on slide 9. Our Consumer segment entered the fourth quarter with strong momentum. The combination of the new mix and match pricing, attractive device promotions, our award-winning network and the new Disney+ partnership drove continued success in the fourth quarter, Amida Competitive [ph] holiday season. We are extremely pleased with the early uptake on Disney+ and the ability to partner with an iconic consumer brand and content company, to bring even greater value to our unlimited customers. As a result, fourth quarter fund gross adds were up 9.3% year-over-year. And postpaid phone net adds were 588,000, up 12.6% year-over-year. Phone churn of 0.83% was up six basis points from a year ago, consistent with our expectations and reflecting the elevated competitive activity across the industry. A breakdown of our postpaid net additions is provided on this slide. Total postpaid device activations were flat from prior year at 9.5 million, including 7.9 million phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 6.3%, down from 6.6% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle. Fios Internet net additions of 35,000 were up sequentially and down year-over-year. Our customers see value in our high-quality broadband offering, paired with multiple choices for video, such as Fios TV, YouTube TV and Disney+. Fios Video net losses for the quarter totaled 51,000. Earlier this month we launched Mix & Match on Fios, providing customers with choice, transparency and the opportunity to only pay for the services they want. Now, let's move to slide 10 to discuss the consumer financial performance. We continue to see growth in consumer operating revenues through our updated service offerings in wireless and Fios which were offset by modest declines in wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in copper-based wireline services. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $24.2 billion and for the full year were $91.1 billion, which were up 2.0% and 1.4% respectively. We are utilizing tools such as pricing and partnerships to add to our value proposition and drive further increases in wireless service revenue and ARPA. Customers recognize the value of being connected to their best network in order to consume services or operate new devices. As customers require additional data, we seek to drive step-ups to unlimited plans from meter plans, step-ups within unlimited to higher tier plans and increasing connections per account. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.4 billion, a 1.9% increase and $53.8 billion for the full year. We expect to see further subscriber growth, as we continue to effectively compete in the marketplace and from continued migrations to unlimited, as approximately 50% of our customer base is still on meter data plans. In the fourth quarter, Consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 2.1%, as pressure from promotional offerings and lower upgrade volumes more than offset the increase in phone gross adds. For the full year, equipment revenue decreased 4.4%, driven primarily by lower upgrade volumes. Consumer Fios revenue remained relatively flat, due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings offsetting the impact of reductions in video subscribers. Consumer segment EBITDA margin was 39.9% in the quarter, down 130 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 44.3%, including headwinds of approximately 85 basis points. The consumer segment demonstrated in 2019 that it can increase customer volumes while continuing to produce strong margins. Now let's move to our business segment on slide 11. Business wireless trends remained strong throughout the year. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were up 10.5% from the prior year, primarily within small and medium business and public sector, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 202,000 which were up 54.2% from the prior year. A breakdown of our postpaid net additions is provided on this slide. Our continued strong customer loyalty across the business segment led to phone churn of 1% in the quarter, which was up 2 basis points sequentially and down 7 basis points over the prior year. Total postpaid device activations in the quarter were up 7.1% over the prior year, while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5% versus 5.3% in the prior year. Let's now move to slide 12 to review our business financial performance. Operating revenues for the business segment in the fourth quarter were up approximately 1% over the prior year. Wireless revenue growth of 8.4% was partially offset by wireline product revenue declines. Wireless service revenue grew 7%, driven primarily by small and medium business customers. From a customer group perspective small and medium business revenue increased 7.9% over the prior year, driven by wireless service revenue growth of more than 11% and double-digit Fios growth, partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services. Global enterprise revenues declined 1.6%, driven by legacy wireline pricing pressure and technology shifts. Public sector and other revenue decreased 1.6%, as growth in wireless products and services was offset by wireline declines. Wholesale revenues declined by 10.6%, driven by price compression and volume declines in legacy wireline products, which we expect to continue. Business segment EBITDA margin was 20.7% in the quarter, down 260 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense in the lease accounting standard. The reductions in margins year-over-year are due to the growth in wireless activations, reductions in wireline revenues and the investments we are making in the business, such as the launch of our business-ready marketing campaign and the transformation of our go-to-market processes. Now, let's move on to slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued to make good progress in the quarter. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, which was essentially flat versus the prior year, a meaningful improvement from the decline reported at the beginning of the year. While we have more work to do, we are very pleased with the results and the foundation we are building for future growth. Native advertising and our demand-side platform continued to gain traction, mitigating the ongoing declines in legacy desktop search revenue streams. Let's now move to slide 14, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we close out 2019, we are providing a reconciliation to legacy 1.0 results for the last time. The charts on this slide reconcile revenue and EBITDA from our consumer and business segments back to wireless and wireline. The top chart shows consumer revenues of $24.2 billion in the quarter. After removing consumer wireline and adding back business wireless, we had total wireless revenues of $25.3 billion, with EBITDA margin of 41.0%. The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from business to wireline results, starting with business revenue of $8.1 billion and arriving at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter, down 4.1% from the prior year. EBITDA margins were 11.9% down from 17.6% last year. The factors impacting wireline margins are largely the same as those highlighted in the business segment, most notably the ongoing pressure from legacy wireline product revenue declines and the investments to drive future growth. You can find additional detail in our supplemental information included on our website. Let's now move to slide 15 to discuss the wireless results. Total wireless operating revenues increased 3.5% and to $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by a 2.7% increase in service revenue and benefits from the total mobile protection pricing action taken in the third quarter. The fourth quarter performance was below our targeted range, primarily as a result of higher base optimization into new pricing plans, which we believe is stabilizing and the impact of increased gross adds on our promotional expense that amortized reservice revenue. For the full year, wireless service revenue grew 3.2%, driven by retail postpaid ARPU growth of 2.5% and a 27.8% increase in phone net adds. Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 41.0%. This includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points, primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard. We are proud of this result, particularly given the strong volumes driven in the quarter. Continuing the momentum from the third quarter, phone gross adds were up 9.6% to 3.1 million. Postpaid phone net adds for the quarter was 790,000, which were up from 653,000 a year ago, marking our highest fourth quarter phone net add performance in the last six years. Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter were 969,000, up 11% from the prior year. Postpaid phone churn of 0.86% was up from 0.82% last year, while total retail postpaid churn of 1.13% was up five basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, we increased customer net accounts by 30,000. Total postpaid device activations were up 1.2%. This was a result of a 6.0% increase in postpaid gross additions from the prior year to 5.1 million, offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 6.0% from 6.3% a year ago. Now let's focus on our outlook for 2020 on slide 16. We exit the year with great momentum, reflected by strong wireless volumes in both our consumer and business segments, which together with our focus on execution positions us for accelerated growth in 2020. For 2020, we expect low to mid single digit percentage growth in consolidated revenue compared to the prior year. Included in this outlook, are continued growth and momentum in wireless service revenue trends within both the consumer and business segments and an expected increase in equipment revenue as we expand the availability and reach of our 5G network. For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings growth of 2% to 4%, driven by recurring service and other revenue growth in both consumer and business as well as ongoing cost initiatives. Adjusted earnings growth includes the impact of deferred commission expense as well as investments within Verizon business group and product development, continued process improvement and new work tools that would not only drive cost savings, but create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G, One Fiber and MEC. We expect to see cost benefits of this work begin to materialize in the back end of 2020 and increase in 2021 with revenue benefits starting in 2022. We are excited about the future opportunities in our business segment and believe revenue and margins will expand in the future. Below the line, we expect depreciation and amortization to be similar to 2019. Interest expense is expected to decline due to lower debt balances and the impact of our liability management last year. We expect each quarter in 2020 to be below the fourth quarter 2019 expense level. Adjusted effective tax rate is guided between 23% and 25% in line with the actual results from the prior two years. We expect consolidated capital spending to be between $17 billion and $18 billion including the expansion of our 5G network in new and existing markets; additional 4G densification to stay ahead of demand and our ongoing fiber build; our capital spending guidance results in our capital intensity continuing within our normal range, although the timing will be higher earlier in the year than last year. In summary, we expect to build on our strong financial performance and are positioned for accelerated growth in 2020. Now, let's take a look at capital allocation. Our capital allocation process is disciplined and focused. Priorities for the upcoming year remain investing in the business, continuing our commitment to the dividend, and managing our balance sheet to achieve our targeted leverage range. With our leverage near the high end of the target range and expectations for EBITDA growth and healthy free cash flow in 2020, we are pleased to add share repurchases as a fourth priority of our capital allocation policy. Repurchases will begin after the priorities have been met including investment in our 5G rollout, potential spectrum purchases and the increased investment in the business segment as highlighted earlier. Our earnings growth outlook for 2020, excludes the benefit from any potential share repurchases. Summing up, in 2019 we demonstrated that we can improve service revenue and grow the company from a position of strength, which drove increased volumes throughout the year, utilizing updated unlimited offerings, effective promotional strategies and partnerships, positioning the company for sustainable growth. Our 5G built right strategy offers new opportunities to drive further growth as we continue to strengthen our network leadership. Importantly, we achieved strong results while expanding our industry leading margins as adjusted for accounting impacts during a period, in which additional competitors entered our industry. Though we continue to face challenges within our legacy products and services, we are making strategic investments to drive growth in the coming years. In addition, we continue to make progress in our media group and we believe we have the necessary assets and appropriate strategy to drive further improvements. Execution is a key focus within Verizon and we remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, delivering on our commitment to strengthen our balance sheet. In short, we entered 2020 with strong momentum poised to deliver growth and innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady, so we can get to your questions.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Matt. Brad, ready to take questions now.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead sir.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. The principal variance in your fourth quarter results versus ours and I think most people's expectations was the higher level of spending in the business P&L and it looks it's on the wireline P&L. During your remarks you talked about a step-up investments in the business services segment to drive growth in the future. So I'm assuming that we've already started to see that in the fourth quarter run rate. I guess what I was hoping to get more clarity on is, what precisely are you spending that on? I mean, if I annualize that uptick it's well in excess of $1 billion of incremental OpEx. So I think there's going to be a lot of interest in where you're spending it and how we should expect that payoff to flow through. And then just the flip side of that is, the annual EPS guidance you gave for this year it looks pretty close to what most people are looking for including us, so there must be an offset and that would imply you're getting better operating leverage somewhere in your wireless business. And so I was hoping you can maybe just walk through where the cost performance and the margin improvement is coming from on wireless as you look into 2020? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: So, Brett I can start and -- so when it comes to the business group, you're right. I mean, we had already impacts in the fourth quarter on our investment that we're doing in the business group. Matt mentioned some of them. If I go deeper, I mean as we are now approaching the market with a full portfolio for our enterprise customers, small and medium customers, we need to get all our billing system, all our tools behind CRM et cetera, actually working in a customer dimension. And this hasn't been invested in before and we just need to invest there. And that's why you see also in the guide that you say yourself we're staying basically on your line of expectation. That means that at the end of the year, we will see impact of those investments and then they're going to roll off. So part of these investments are, of course, one-timers investments we're doing and then it will go away because we just need to fix a couple of things in order to address the market in the right side -- on the right way. Secondly, the secular decline in wireline business that is continuing. So that is a little bit more sustainable. But that's why in the remarks on that we said also that in 2021, we'll see even more impact of the cost reductions we're doing and then the revenue impact will start gradually coming 2021, 2022 in this side. But all-in-all we're very excited about the opportunities that Verizon business group have, because that's why we started building the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network some three, four years ago in order to actually address this market in the best way and the traction we are seeing with our customers is really good. But on your first question, if there is some impact in the fourth quarter the answer is, yes. Matt anything to add?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Good morning, Brett. Thanks for the question. So we certainly saw the uptick in spending as Hans discussed. We feel very strongly about the opportunities in VBG even more so today than we did when we announced a new operating structure. But some parts of that business haven't been a focus of our investment over the years, so we're excited about the future ahead there. You mentioned a kind of annualized run rate of $1 billion and that's certainly not the number that we have in mind for that investment in 2020. So I think that's significantly overstating where the 2020 number will be. But if you go back to the comments earlier, we did say that we would expect to see an impact on margins in 2020 in line with what we saw in the second half of 2019. I would expect we'll start to see the benefits of the transformation activities on the cost side of the business around the back end of the year really impacting 2021 in a more significant fashion and then getting into 2022 and beyond on the revenue side. But look we -- I think the underlying thing here is the level of confidence that we have that over time by making these investments, we can grow both revenue and margins within the business segment. So that's what we're focused on. You also asked about the total margin structure of the company. If you've got this additional cost, the earnings guide would suggest there's some other things offsetting it in the other direction. I think it starts with revenue. When you continue to have strong service revenue growth in both consumer and business on the wireless side and some of the other revenue lines that we mentioned that gives you a good starting point for earnings growth. When you combine that with our ongoing cost activities and then even with the investment we're making in VBG, I would expect to see upside to earnings through the year as a result of that.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks. Maybe for Matt on service revenue growth came in a little bit lighter than we expected here in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little bit more detail on sort of the drivers there especially in light of the better-than-expected subs? And it also looked like consumer wholesale wireless revenues were sort of flattish sequentially. Was there any kind of reset this quarter in the sort of wholesale rate, especially given the growth in subscribers in some of your MVNO customers? And then lastly, any commentary looking out to 2020 on service revenue growth year-over-year would be great? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, John. Look for service revenue growth in the fourth quarter at 2.7% for wireless as a whole as you say was all below the guide that we had. A couple of reasons for that and both of them actually speak to the value that we're creating with our customers. The first is we actually saw the people who had the opportunity to optimize by moving to the new pricing structure that we launched in August actually moved a little faster than we initially anticipated. And so we think that's actually now complete and behind us earlier than we expected might see a little bit of an impact in the first half of 2020, but certainly got more of it behind us in 2019. And then the other piece is a little bit of accounting noise in the service revenue line. A number of our -- part of our handset costs from a promo standpoint get capitalized and amortized against service revenue. So when you have the increase in volumes that we had in 3Q and 4Q where we had gross adds we're up around 10% year-over-year in both quarters. What that means is we're starting to see an increase in that promo amortization coming against the service revenue line. That will be a little bit of a headwind in the first half of 2020 as well until that reaches kind of a plateau level in terms of the impact. But certainly, as you think about service revenue at the end of the year, the trajectory of the business having the net add growth that we had, we feel very strong about another good year of service revenue ahead of us. And as we mentioned, net adds the highest number that we've had for six years. So the wireless business is performing well in both consumer and in business and we expect that to continue.\nHans Vestberg: So I can only add on to Matt that of course this is part of our strategy. I mean, since the launch of unlimited, we have constantly sort of developed our model to see that our customer can enjoy different type of packages in the mix and match, but we also had a very clear strategy. You see that our metered customers can be able to go up to unlimited and that's why we made the move in August. And I mean we see the payoffs here with the net adds. We roughly have today 50-50 metered and unlimited. So we see that the continuation of putting more value in the packages and seeing that we can actually get the journey for our customer coming into the unlimited is extremely good. And that's as a growth engine for us and you have seen that in the second quarter -- or the second half of 2019. So we have more to do here but I think that the whole team of Ronan Dunne, et cetera they are thinking about this. But also don't forget business side with Tami that have done a really good job with the wireless customers as well. So, we're really encouraged when we see what we have done in the -- in our offerings and how that has responded well with the market. So, we're happy with what we have seen in the last half year end and give us encouragement for 2020.\nJohn Hodulik: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Brad, ready for the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi guys. Thanks. You put up a big CapEx number at the end of the year and guided to the similar $17 billion to $18 billion. Can you talk about any shifts within the CapEx priorities for 2020 versus 2019 in terms of either fiber versus wireless mix or any shift within the fiber build in terms of the types of locations or deployments you plan to do? And when should we think about you starting to really monetize that fiber build? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Yes. As you saw that we had a strong CapEx coming into the fourth quarter, ultimately, I'm really happy about it. You can see that our pace is coming up here quite dramatically in what we're investing in right now. And the interesting thing is of course that since we launched the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, we have constantly found a lot of efficiency in our CapEx build and that of course is giving us possibilities to continue to do more and more. So, I think that our technology department have no constraints on what they need to do in 2020. This is what they have plans for in order for us to continue to fortify our 4G network to continue with strong additions in the 5G as well as continue with our fiber build. And when it comes to the monetization of the fiber build, we're already starting to do that. Of course because many of the fibers right now are going to our cell sites on air because that was a part of it. Then of course it has come a little bit later in monetization for our small and medium businesses and enterprise business, et cetera. But clearly we're already now seeing the benefits of doing that. So, going into 2020, I think we have a very solid capital allocation for our CapEx. Matt and the team have worked with the technology team and we are improving every year how we do this work. And, of course, it's a lot of reallocation inside that 2017 to 2018 and if we go back three years, it's a dramatic change how we spend because of the new design on the network but also the technology evolutions.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks. So, on the monetization of the fiber, as Hans mentioned, it's a multiuse network. But you're already starting to see the impact and I'll give an example. And I think some of our network folks have mentioned this publicly in the past few months. You go back to the first quarter of last year and the majority of our new cell sites were going up on third-party fiber you get into the fourth quarter of last year in the 60-plus markets that -- where we're adding fiber. It's now -- a significant majority is going up on our own fiber. So, that will have a significant beneficial -- significant benefit on you'd think our expenses going forward. And then as we continue to go, we'll add other monetization opportunities over the course of the next couple of years. So, I'd say we're already starting to see the benefits of the fiber build in our income statement.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks Matt.\nBrady Connor: Brad, ready for the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question from David Barden of Bank of America. Sir, you may go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two questions if I could. First, just with respect to kind of the back part of the year I think that there's a degree of anxiety about the level of competition that might emerge in the market around 5G and around the possibility of a 5G iPhone launch and how the various carriers are going to market and kind of position themselves as network to go to for it. So, if you could kind of give us a little color on kind of how you see the second half of the year playing out with this potential 5G iPhones' super cycle emerging? And then the second would be I just wanted to have you guys maybe address there's an organization called Opensignal that has shared some data with the sell-side and others that kind of suggests that there's a handful of markets that Verizon's stressed in terms of their spectrum allocations. And I think that that's raised kind of questions about what Verizon spectrum strategy is a network management strategy is going to be as we kind of bump into some of these limitations. So, I just want to have you guys address that if you could? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. On the first question there. I mean Ronan Dunne already said in the beginning of the year that we're going to have some 20 5G devices coming out in the market this year. So, of course, we're going to see more 5G devices coming out. It's going to be more build in the markets in 2020 than we had last year. So, of course, this is a year that there is going to be even more 5G things coming in. When it comes to any particular phones coming out in the market, we cannot really comment on it because that we'll leave to the company to do. But, in general, of course, if this is a market which has a high degree of iOS that means that when a 5G phone will come out from Apple, that will be important for many consumers to look into what they think is a good change. In our case, I think we're building a unique 5G experience with our millimeter wave that nobody else is building and have the capability to do. So I think that's really where the difference will come. I mean, we already have the best 4G network as you have seen in the latest J.D. Power and RootMetrics. We're going to continue to have that. So we're going to give the best experience for customers. And we -- and I'm confident that how we are building the network will make a big difference. And that's why we also feel very confident if -- with all these devices coming out, including if the iPhone would come out, that we will have a good chance to actually grab more customers that want to be on our network. When it comes to the spectrum and all of that, I mean, I think that I might have talked about this so many times. I mean, one thing is of course that we first of all have all the assets to deploy our 5G strategy, when it comes to millimeter wave and using dynamic spectrum sharing be able to nationwide when our customers are ready. So I think that's clear. I think that another thing that is very clear that spectrum is not the only thing that is needed to do a great network. Think about what I have seen. I worked with 400 carriers around the world in my life. It is a lot of carriers have a lot of spectrum. They don't have a great network. I mean, they don't use it in the right way. I came to this company, because these companies invest on the world, how to deal with data. Everything from spectrum to how you densify networks and what type of software you put in and that's a long-term planning how to do that right. And I think that's something where you -- or people around us go wrong when I look at us, because think about how we have been performing and many actually thought that we would never sustain an unlimited. And the more, the network is growing we're getting more and more headroom as we're continuing deploying our software and the engineering capabilities we have in the company. So again, we feel good about the position we have. Of course, as we all know, there might come out the C-band. And we're of course encouraged about the FCC's plan of doing that. We think the C-band is an important spectrum for many reasons. I mean, first of all, it's one of the global spectrums that frequency will be global. So roaming will be done on it, and that's very important for U.S. market to get into that. And it's very important for Verizon to get into that. So I think -- but it's not hindering our strategy right now to deploy a great 5G network and be able to capture the market on 5G.\nDavid Barden: Thanks so much.\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. I'll just add one comment on that David on that piece. I mean, our engineers took a look at that report yesterday and they said there's so much missing in terms of their planning. They have line of sight to meet our needs for many years to come. And so I think, I would put money on our engineering team every day of the week and their track record is second to none. So we're very, very confident that we have the spectrum we need to continue to grow the business.\nDavid Barden: Awesome. Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir, you may go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good morning. On spectrum, maybe you could just comment on CBRS. Obviously, there's an auction coming up, how do you see that fitting into your plans? And then on 5G Home, you haven't talked a whole lot about it. With the CPE coming, is that still second half of the year? What are your expectations for what we should see in 2020? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. On the CBRS, as you know, we have already started for quite a long time ago to do trials and see how it works and it works fine. We think it's a good addition to the portfolio that in order to see that we get good customer expectations. So we think CBRS is an important spectrum even though it is sort of more share than anything else, but it's going to be definitely something we're using as it comes out. Secondly, when it comes to the 5G Home, I mean, you're confirming actually what we have in front of us. The next-generation chipset that goes into the CP for 5G Home will come out. At least the plan right now is in third quarter, which means that commercial product is probably coming out a little bit later because it takes some time from the chipset to the device. By then we will have of course deployed far more millimeter wave across the country, so we will be able to start launching many more markets when that happens. So that will come back to a little bit more about that when have our Investor Day, the 13th of February talk a little bit more about it. But that's in the grand scheme the plans for 5G Home and that's no different from what we said half a year ago.\nSimon Flannery: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Sir, you may go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Good morning. Can you share any early results? I know it's very early days, but of your mix and match video offer? And it's hard to miss that with your mix and match video offer for Fios that the customer is seemingly far better off to choose the YouTube TV option to save a lot of money. Is that the intention? And why not make the step to say that's our only video offer and you really focus the business on the Fios broadband connectivity where it would seem you have a much better story to tell?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I think when it comes to the mix and match, we want to give our customers optionality on top of the broadband. If it's the fiber broadband or if it's the 5G Home broadband, we want to give them optionality. Of course, one optionality is always to have a broadband and having over-the-top services. But another is of course giving the mix and match optionality right now to see that they use the right packages that is more fitted for them. Still of course, it's what they can choose whatever channels you have because they come in packages. But the early \u2013 or early indication is of course that customers that has been on trial for a month, they clearly see what channels they're using and what package we can suggest for that that is going to be more optimized. So I think for us we just think about our customers and where the market is going and we want to give them the optionality of actually having different ways they can address the market when it comes to their content consumptions. And I think it's good for our customer experience but it's also good for our customers because all of them can do it. So as you said, it's a little bit early, but I think that our customers are very happy that we're giving them this optionality. And I think this is of course, what everyone see where the market is going meaning more and more over-the-top content is coming in and you want \u2013 you need thought mixing and matching that. And here we have a great opportunity given our NFL service strategy and we can work with all the type of optionality in the content market as we're not owning any content.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we are ready for the next question\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, good morning. Thanks. A couple of follow up questions. First with the revenue guidance range of low to mid-single-digits for 2020. Can you frame the flex points as to what would drive revenue growth to the higher end of the range relative to the lower end of the range? And then second with respect to the fiber expansion, can you just also frame for us just the total amount of fiber you're trying to go after over a three to five year period to help us put into context what the current deployment activity means for the company's longer-term goals. Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Mike. So let me start with the revenue guide and unpack that a little bit for you. So as you think about how would you get from 0.8% this year to low to mid-single digits next year, if I go through the individual pieces they're obviously within consumer. It's a continuation of service revenue trajectory that you've seen so far the other revenue line as well. And then within business, again continuation of those service revenue trends. They're very, very strong. We don't see those slowing down anytime soon. So that will be better. A little bit of improvement on the wireline side within business but nothing significant. And then even within media, you think about that being down 3% on a full year basis in 2019 but getting back to about flat in the fourth quarter, so less of a headwind of revenue from media in 2020 than 2019. Within the total number, the 0.8% last year, wireless equipment was negative 3.1%. We don't expect that number to be negative in 2020. But obviously that is the biggest wildcard within the overall revenue guide as we think about it in terms of knowing exactly what we see, primarily in the second half of the year as you get into the holiday season and iconic launches and the like. But we feel optimistic about the revenue growth going forward here really building on the momentum that we've built across both consumer and business over the course of the past couple of years and feel pretty good about that guide as a result.\nHans Vestberg: On the fiber side, I mean, I think first of all I mean, we said it in \u2013 a couple of times during 2019. We're starting to get on the level of sort of activity per month and quarter right now that we were planning from the beginning. It took us some two years to get out to that pace. The team is really good at it right now. We can get much more scalability around it than the way we're doing it. Remember also, we always do the trade-off between owning and leasing or sharing with someone and that is a very prudent or financially disciplined way of looking at our deployment. In many cases we see it as owning it has really an advantage for us because of the multiuse of our network. Now we're doing sites all the time. We're going to create revenue for our business side. So we probably have a couple of years left on doing that. But in general I feel good about the pace we have right now and the multiuse of the fiber we have. And I think this is one of the most critical assets in a network today \u2013 in today's world, especially as we build Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and you want actually to start delivering the 5G experience that we're expecting. We need this fiber to be there. So that's basically where we are with the fiber.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Mike. Brad, we are ready for the next question\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Sir, please go ahead.\nTim Horan: Thanks. With 5G I think the coverage is going to be very important also and I think you're using dynamic spectrum selection for that. Can you just talk about how that's going and the timing? And then just kind of further on 5G, maybe just some color on what you're thinking, how much further ahead you are than your peers? And maybe lastly any other use cases that you're seeing talking to either enterprise customers or consumer customers for 5G for both coverage and density? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. On the DSS, the dynamic spectrum sharing as you have seen some PR, we're done. We have already gotten this to work from the software point of view. And the majority of our baseband is ready for taking DSS. So what we have said, I'm not going to give you an exact date, but I'm going to tell you, we're going to be ready when we feel the market is ready and our customers need to have that coverage. And again, remember we want to have the best network performance-wise. We don't want to deploy it, because it's called 5G. We want to see that, we actually give a superior performance to our customers. And that's why we think that the millimeter wave what we're doing there is extremely important, because we talked about 10 to 20 times at least more throughput and speed than we have on the 4G network and we still have the best 4G network. So I think that's what we already assessed. When we meet at the Investor Day, we're going to talk a little bit more about the technology sector. We'll get a little bit more in-depth around that. When it comes to the 5G and where we are I think that you saw last year that we had a strong deployment coming in during 2019, but of course, we have even higher ambitions in 2020. And we will also come back and talk a little bit about \u2013 more about that. But it goes in all three directions in our multipurpose network. It's for the mobility case, for the home case and it's also for the 5G mobile edge compute case, not forgetting that because all three of them are using our multipurpose network. And when it comes to use cases, I can do some of them. But of course, on the mobile edge compute, we see a lot of optimization in factories. We see private \u2013 we see private 5G networks in order to keep the data and the security and the throughput in a facility, if that's a campus whatever that use case has come up very early on. On the consumer side, I guess, there's sort of a big event coming up here on Sunday. It's called Football, American Football and you're going to see quite a lot on 5G experience there. What we can do with millimeter wave in the stadium, how we can use broadcasting cameras with 5G a lot of new innovation both for the consumer, but also for the distribution of content. With our spectrum positioning, we basically are limited on the uplink when it comes to stadiums, which is the big blocker today in a stadium. So I think you're going to see quite a lot next, I'd say, four or five days on consumer cases, as well as we will continue to give you more insights to it, the next couple of weeks and when we meet in New York here.\nTim Horan: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Brad, we got time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. I actually wanted to talk about the buyback. I was wondering, if you could talk about providing any more color on the potential for timing. You mentioned one of the sensitivities was potential purchases of spectrum. Obviously, we had the CBRS auction, I think in June and then C-band whether it's later this year or maybe early next year. Do those have to have first take place and you have to have a better understanding of ultimately what you spent before you could actually start to do a buyback? Or could you actually end up doing it before? And then secondly, there's been a lot of debate around your current MVNO relationship with various cable companies and some of your competitors making some comments that they're going to try to go after that. Is there a specific date when that contract expires or anything specific about 2020 that we should be thinking about that could be a catalyst, if you will for the wanting to leave? And how important is it to you to maintain that? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Hi, Colby, thanks for the question. So on the buyback look it's great to be having this conversation. We're approaching our target leverage had good conversations with the board for quite a while now. As we get closer to the target range what comes next? And so glad to announce that change in the capital allocation model this morning. But as you mentioned, there's a couple of key variables as we think about capital allocation going forward here. And spectrum is the largest one of those. So I don't know, if we need to actually get through the auctions, but having line of sight to exactly when the auctions will be is kind of a key variable. So we're very supportive of the actions the FCC is taking to try to make as much spectrum available. And as we get a little more clarity hopefully in the near-term future, that will also impact our decision on timing of any buybacks. But as you think about buybacks, the reason why we're having that conversation is the strong cash flow that we saw last year. Last year, we were at $35.7 billion of CFFO. And even after you back out CapEx and the dividend $7.8 billion left over. And with an expectation of EPS growth, working capital might be a little bit of a wild card, but I would expect to see that free cash flow after dividend number be strong again this year and expect it to be higher on a year-over-year basis. So, it puts us in a great position, where we can make some good decisions going forward here.\nHans Vestberg: On the MNO, so I can -- as we're having it as Service as a Strategy, this is important relationships for us. That's how we want to get monetization better than anybody else on our capital investments and that's why we're building a network. We are managing a multitude of stakeholders and the MNOs are important. It's an ongoing relationship. And we really think its important relationships, so that's us any sort of large enterprises. We need to see that we have both agile on the technology side and having good conversations with them, but it's no different from another enterprise you would have. So -- and I think it's a win-win for both of us. And hopefully they see equally good value having MNO on top of the best network in the country. At the same time as we see a value over there as well. So, we will continue to be there. And it's hard for me to comment, what my competitors are saying about it. I'm not sure what insights they have. But again, we feel good about our relationship and we will continue to see that we are managing it as any very important customer.\nColby Synesael: Thank you, very much.\nBrady Connor: That's all the time we have today. Before I end the call, I'd like to turn it back to Hans for a couple of closing comments real quick.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. I will be brief on this one. I think, we have talked about all the relevant things for Q4, 2019 and 2020 and as I said, we have our Investor Day coming up here in February. So -- but all in all, I reinforce that we did a lot of transformation in 2019. The team and the organization has really responded well to it. That goes all the way from a network change, to our organization change, to our voluntary program branding and all of that went down and at the same time, we've delivered a strong result. And I think we have set us up ourselves for actually continued good role. We have said that long term we have -- would like to have growth of GDP plus. I think the guide this year is an acceleration compared to '19, which means that the confidence level is going up, what we can do with the core assets we have. And we still sort of have told you where 5G will come in, which is more of 2021. So, we work with assets we have right now, but we build also a great foundation on 5G going forward for the years after. So, all-in-all, I think the whole team, the executive team and the company feel excited coming into 2020 and that's how I sum it up. Thank you, very much for being on this call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-10-25 13:47:09", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.  Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.  The presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder, we are in the middle of a millimeter wave spectrum auction, so we will not be able to comment on our current millimeter wave spectrum holdings or spectrum strategy.  Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.25 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results contain two special items: a net pretax gain from dispositions of assets and businesses of $261 million, and a $291 million pretax pension remeasurement charge. The gain from dispositions includes several transactions during the quarter primarily the sale of our Sunnyvale Yahoo! campus as we look forward to moving to our new Verizon Media Group facility in San Jose.  The mark-to-market pension charge was related to our management pension plan, which triggered remeasurement earlier in the year as a result of the Voluntary Separation Program. The charge is primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate assumption during the quarter. The net impact of these special items was minimal to net income, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.25, which is up to 2.5% compared to $1.22 a year ago.  Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the second quarter. Consistent with previous quarters, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition and ASC 842 for leases. As we pointed out the past 2 quarters, we have realized a lesser benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. This reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue until the end of 2020. The impact was $0.03 for the third quarter and $0.09 on a year-to-date basis.  Accounting standard ASC 842 for leases resulted in a gross-up on the balance sheet for all operating leases at the beginning of the year. In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs, which results in a headwind of $0.01 in the third quarter and $0.04 year-to-date. We expect the fourth quarter impact to be within the previously provided range of $0.01 to $0.02 per share.  As you can see on the earnings waterfall slide, adjusted EPS growth of 2.5% reflects the strong underlying performance of the business, partially offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense and the adoption of the leasing standard. Matt will take you through the details of the quarterly performance later in the call.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Brady, and thanks, everyone, for joining the third quarter earnings call. I want to start by saying that I'm very pleased how well the team executed our strategy and operation this quarter. We made a lot of progress on our overall strategy, so I'm very happy with it. Let's start with the network. I think the network team has continued to execute extremely well. I'm confident in our ability to keep winning the third-party awards on the 4G network. We are just continuing to do a really good job there. At the same time, our team is executing on our 5G strategy, and we're now up to 15 markets where we have deployed our 5G Ultra Wideband. Our commitment with 30 markets by year-end is still committed, and we will continue to do so the rest of this year.  At the same time, we also launched the 5G Home city based on the NR standard. That proves the model now is moving into the standard 5G to really see that we get the full benefit of the deployment and the development on the 5G standard when it comes to 5G Home. We're also doing a lot of things in One Fiber, continue to have a very high pace in that. And that One Fiber is so important for our overall Intelligent Edge Network that we are deploying in the company in order to realize the market-purpose network to gain all the efficiencies and serve our customers even better over time. So in short, a lot of progress in the network.  At the same time, our strategy execution in the quarter showed a lot around our business model, the flexibility we have in the business model. Just recently, we made an announcement with Disney and our agreement when Disney when it comes to Disney+. I think this proves the model that we have decided to have with a very strong network distribution and a brand that attracts the best brands on the planet to work with us, and we're extremely excited over that.  At the same time, we continue to deploy also 5G Ultra Wideband in stadiums especially now with NFL, 13 stadiums when the season kicks off having 5G coverage. This is important for us because it's part of the dense urban areas where you have a lot of viewers at the same time when really our 5G is coming to excel. Because of the 5G build that we're doing with our assets is -- we're making a real big difference here.  At the same time, we're also working, of course, with the -- our 5G mobile edge compute. And as we stated already in the beginning of the year, we're going to launch the first 5G mobile edge compute center in the fourth quarter. And that is in progress, and we're going to announce that later this quarter. So we're excited on that.  At the same time, you see us engaging much more with large enterprises because with the 5G platform and 8 currencies, we are now a lot of interactions. We announced in this quarter, for example, collaboration with SAP, Corning. All of them are use cases for the 5G mobile edge compute. So we're excited all that opportunity we're creating with the 5G mobile edge compute with the largest companies in the market.  When it comes to Verizon Media Group, they also had a quarter with a lot of strategy execution and came out with a lot of new products in the portfolio: a new mail service. They also had the enhancement on the Yahoo! Sports and Finance, a lot of traction on it. We saw a great take up on our NFL that we have now with Yahoo! Sports. So all in all, our Verizon Media Group is executing on the strategy we laid out one year ago in a really good way.  And finally, earlier in the quarter, I think we continued to lead the charge in the wireless and Consumer market with our new mix and match, which is just continuation of how we want to bring our customers to understand how they can move up in the value chain to unlimited. I have to say Ronan Dunne and his team are doing an excellent job to really to move this market forward.  And as you can see in our operation performance, we had a really good quarter when it comes to wireless additions here, one of the best quarter -- third quarter we had in several years. So really, this paying off what we are doing in the model and actually moving this forward. So all in all, a lot of progress on our strategy. Of course, a lot more to be done, but it's clearly now positioning us where we want to be as a company with our customers and our shareholders.  Finally, this of course came down to our finance. We had a revenue growth almost 1% in the quarter. More important, we continue to have a wireless service growth in the quarter, we continue on the same level almost we have the previous quarters. And all in all, that converted into continued EPS growth that we had in this quarter as well. And that is, of course, coming with a very strong underlying operational performance with some headwinds coming from accounting. But to go on the very good work from the team, which is based on our commitment of cost efficiencies or voluntary that were done and all of the things we're doing at the same time.  That also conclude in a very strong free cash flow, continue to take control of our balance sheet and seeing that we're putting ourselves and our Board in a good position going forward. So all in all, the finance performance really sort of resonated with a strategic execution we did in the quarter.  We had all saw a lot of execution when it comes to responsible business, and this is important to us because it's part of our strategy. We made commitment around our education or 5G to schools. We made commitments around our CO2 emissions. All in all, this is part of our strategy, it's part of our responsible business. Ultimately, it should be good business for all of us, for our customers, for our shareholders and our employees who should be part of that journey. So we continue on that path, and we think it's very important for all our stakeholders.  All in all, a very good quarter. The team executed well on all the metrics. There's areas that we need to improve. There's areas that we're still working on. But in general, I would say that I'm happy and satisfied how the Verizon team is showing up this quarter.  By that, I hand it over to Matt.\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a review of our consolidated operating and [Technical Difficulty] On a reported basis, third quarter consolidated revenue was $32.9 billion, up 0.9%. This growth was priority-driven by higher wireless service revenue, partially offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline revenue, predominantly in our Business segment. Year-to-date consolidated revenue is up 0.5%, in line with our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth for 2019.  In the third quarter, we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA margin while positioning for future wireless revenue growth by updating our unlimited offer and executing effective promotions to drive strong wireless volumes. The headwinds that Brady mentioned earlier from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard lowered EBITDA by $240 million, which is approximately a 70 basis point impact on EBITDA margin in the quarter. As reported, third quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6%, down from 37.4% in the prior year. Since we initiated our business excellence program in 2018, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $4.6 billion and are on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021. Our Voluntary Separation Program has produced approximately $900 million of expense savings year-to-date, including over $400 million of savings in the third quarter. The last tranche of employees exited the business in late June, so we have now reached our full run rate of expense savings for the VSP.  As Brady mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.25, up from $1.22 a year ago. This is the third quarter this year with adjusted EPS growth of 2.5% or higher, highlighting the strength and momentum in the business. The combination of wireless service revenue momentum, solid margin performance and strong customer volumes keeps us on track to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance of low single-digit percentage growth for 2019, excluding the impact of the lease accounting standard. Additionally, we still expect our full year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to come in at the lower end of the 24% to 26% range.  Now let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. As a reminder, our Consumer segment includes both wireless and wireline products and services, targeting retail customers as well as our wireless wholesale operations. In August, we launched new unlimited price plans, which provide more choice to customers and an easier entry point into unlimited on the nation's best network. As a result, phone gross additions were up 10% over the prior year. The popularity of the new mix and match plans and overall value proposition drove postpaid phone net additions of 239,000 for the quarter, more than double the 112,000 last year. Postpaid smartphone net additions were 372,000, up from 285,000 in the prior year. Total postpaid net additions were 193,000, including other connected devices of 130,000, primarily wearables, offset by tablet losses of 176,000.  Our network leadership, coupled with the personalization of our customer value proposition led to a postpaid phone churn of 0.79%, which was similar to last year even with additional market participants. Total postpaid device activations were flat from prior year at 7.4 million, including 6.2 million phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.9%, down from 5.1% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle. In the third quarter, prepaid net losses were 81,000 compared to a loss of 96,000 last year. Our focus on the high-value prepaid market has resulted in stable prepaid revenue despite declining volumes.  Fios Internet net additions of 30,000 were relatively flat sequentially and down year-over-year. Fios Video results continued to be impacted by the ongoing shift away from linear video offerings with losses of 67,000. Our customers see value in our high-quality broadband offering paired with multiple choices for video through linear TV bundles or over-the-top options, such as YouTube TV and the recently announced Disney+.  Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss Consumer financial performance. In the third quarter, total Consumer operating revenues were $22.7 billion, which is up 1.4%. This was primarily driven by continued strong growth in wireless service revenue and Fios service offerings, offset by declines in wireless equipment and legacy wireline services. As we look to add value beyond connectivity, other revenue grew 18.7% primarily driven by recurring services, such as Total Mobile Protection. Consumer wireless service revenue increased by 2.1% over the prior year even as we introduced new unlimited pricing. We increase wireless service revenue and offer by driving customer step-ups to unlimited plans from metered plans and increasing connections per account. We have continued room for further growth as around 50% of our customer account base is currently on unlimited plans. In the third quarter, Consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 5.6% as lower upgrade rates more than offset an increase in phone gross adds. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.7% due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings.  Consumer EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 45.3%, which was down 30 basis points from the prior year. This includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard. We are extremely proud of the team's ability to drive significant volume in the quarter while maintaining strong EBITDA margin.  Now let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business segment includes wireless and wireline products and services provided across 4 customer groups: global enterprise, small and medium business, wholesale and public sector and other. Business wireless volumes remain strong with a 12% increase in gross adds for the quarter primarily within small and medium business and public sector. Postpaid net adds were 408,000 compared to 364,000 in the prior year. This includes 205,000 phones, 112,000 tablets and 91,000 other connected devices. Our continued strong customer loyalty across the Business segment led to phone churn of 0.98%, which is relatively flat sequentially and up slightly over the prior year. Total postpaid churn of 1.22% was up 5 basis points compared to the prior year. Total postpaid device activations were up 5.7% while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.5% versus 4.8% in the prior year.  Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the Business financial performance. Strong wireless service revenue growth and high-quality fiber products were offset by softness in legacy wireline technologies, causing total operating revenues for the Business segment to be approximately flat for the quarter. Revenue from our Business wireless products grew 6.9%, including 6.1% wireless service revenue growth. This performance reflects Verizon's best-in-class network quality, reliability and solutions-based approach with our Business customers. Revenue from our wireline products declined 6.7% in the quarter.  From a customer group perspective, global enterprise revenues declined 2.4%, driven by legacy pricing pressure and technology shifts. Wholesale revenues declined by 13.7% driven by price compression and volume declines, which we expect to continue in a highly competitive marketplace. Small and medium business revenue increased 6.2% driven by wireless service and Fios growth, partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services. Public sector and other revenue increased 1.2% as a result of growth in wireless and wireline products and services.  Business segment EBITDA margin was 25.2%, which was down 300 basis points primarily driven by the decline in high-margin wholesale revenue. This also includes headwinds of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard.  Now let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the third quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $1.8 billion, which was down 2.0% versus the prior year, continuing the improvement in revenue trends. Gains in native and mobile advertising continue to be offset by declines in desktop advertising, though the business is building momentum in key areas. We are migrating customers to our recently integrated native and demand side advertising platforms with double-digit growth year-over-year. For the first time, we are seeing mobile traffic increases outpace desktop traffic declines in our core owned and operated products, including sports, finance, news, entertainment, home and mail. Although it's early in the NFL season, customer engagement has doubled over a year ago in terms of minutes watched as more and more fans are using their mobile devices to watch games on Yahoo! Sports. We are diversifying our monetization streams in Media Group, including additional customer engagement opportunities on Yahoo! Sports and fantasy platforms and the launch of new integrated content-to-commerce capabilities.  Let's now move to Slide 12, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we have previously committed to provide transparency through our transition to the new Verizon 2.0 segmentation, Slide 12 contains a reconciliation similar to the one we provided in the second quarter. These waterfall charts reconcile revenue and EBITDA from our Consumer and Business segments back to wireless and wireline.  The top chart shows Consumer revenue of $22.7 billion in the quarter. After removing Consumer wireline and adding back Business wireless, we report total wireless revenues of $23.6 billion, with EBITDA margin of 46.8%. The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from Business to wireline results, starting with Business revenue of $7.9 billion and ultimately arriving at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter, with EBITDA margin of 17.4%. Wireline revenues were down 3.8% from prior year, with margins down from the prior period as a result of the ongoing pressures in legacy product volumes and price compression. You can find additional detail in our supplemental information included on our website.  Let's now move to Slide 13 to discuss the wireless results. Looking at overall wireless, which includes both Consumer and Business, total operating revenues increased 2.6% to $23.6 billion in the third quarter, primarily driven by a 2.7% increase in service revenue. Based on the momentum in the business, which is carried over into October, we expect total wireless service revenue growth for the fourth quarter to be between 3% and 3.5%. Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 46.8%. This includes headwinds of approximately 90 basis points primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margin was 47.7%, similar to prior year despite the significant increase in volumes.  The success of our new mix and match unlimited plans translated into impressive volumes driven by phone gross adds up 10% to 2.7 million, which marks our highest third quarter phone gross add performance in the last 5 years. Postpaid phone net adds for the quarter were 444,000, which were up from 295,000 a year ago. Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter was 615,000, up 21% from 510,000 in the prior year. Total postpaid net adds was 601,000, consisting of tablet losses of 64,000 and connected device gains of 221,000, mostly driven by wearables. Postpaid phone churn of 0.82% was up slightly from 0.80% last year while total retail postpaid churn of 1.09% was up 5 basis points year-over-year.  For the quarter, we increased customer net accounts by 25,000 as compared to zero in the third quarter last year. Total postpaid device activations were up 1.1%. This was driven by an increase in postpaid gross additions of 4.3 million, up 7.7% from the prior year, offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 4.8% from 5.0% a year ago.  To recap the wireless quarter across Consumer and Business, we reset unlimited pricing and absorbed the initial impact from optimizes. We were competitive on the promotional front, and we drove strong wireless volumes that set us up for future growth. All of this was accomplished while growing EBITDA on a like-for-like basis and generating one of our strongest free cash flow quarters in several years. We are excited about the trends in our wireless products while pushing forward to extend our 5G leadership.  Let's now focus on our consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on Slide 14. Year-to-date, cash flow from operating activities total $26.7 billion, up from $26.2 billion during the prior year. Benefits from year-over-year operational improvements and lower discretionary employee benefit contributions were partially offset by higher cash tax payments and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. Year-to-date capital spending was $12.3 billion, which was up slightly from the prior year. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in data and video traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network, the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint. We maintain our full year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion.  The net result to cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first 3 quarters of the year of $14.4 billion. We ended the quarter with $109.6 billion of total gross debt, which is $3.3 billion lower than the prior year. The unsecured debt balance was $100.8 billion, which is lower year-over-year by $2.9 billion and lower sequentially by $1.3 billion. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1x versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0x, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet. We remain focused on reducing our unsecured debt portfolio while continuing to actively manage our near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be in order: investing in the business, continuing our commitment to the dividend and managing our balance sheet to achieve our targeted leverage range.  In the third quarter, we demonstrated yet another period of focused execution. We were able to maintain strong EBITDA performance and generate solid cash flow while driving significant volumes to set ourselves up for future revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. We continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, and we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet, all while leading the industry in 5G development.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady so we can get to your questions.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Matt. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: If we look at some of your most recent moves with the unlimited price adjustment and now the partnership with Disney to give away Disney+ for free for a year, it certainly seems like you're assuming a bit more of a growth posture than we've seen from the company recently. And I was hoping you could maybe just sort of frame to us why you see this opportunity as we're sort of late in the 4G cycle, not quite in the 5G cycle yet. How are you hoping this is going to position you as you do get ready to ramp more aggressively in 5G? And then of course, anytime we see an operator become a little more growth-centric, there's always some degree of investment to create that growth. How do we think about the level of spending you're going to have to incur to make sure you can keep this momentum going?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you very much. I think that when we -- this is part of the overall strategy that we outlined in the beginning of the year. We have a great network. We have the distribution and, of course, the brand. We -- when it comes to Disney+, we can partner with the best partners, and it's actually a win-win. I mean actually, they are gaining a lot to be partnering with us as we are gaining a lot as well. And I think this is a differentiation we can provide to our customers and given the flexibility and so on. So I think that first of all, not assuming that this is a heavy investment, it's actually a win-win in all aspects. I think that's very important.  Then when it comes to our move on mix and match early in the quarter, that has been part of a very rigid planning, very disciplined way of viewing things where we are actually ramping and doing a pathway for our customers to come into unlimited, moving up in unlimited, where ultimately, when 5G comes, we're going to have ubiquitous 5G coverage, they can move up to that higher level.  So it's all a plan, but we also said all the time, we see opportunities on 4G as well. I mean we know that we outlined a great opportunity on 5G with 4 different business cases. But hey, we can execute on what we have on the assets we have today, and we are very happy that -- with that in this -- and we use our strength right now to really see that we are using the market opportunities that we see. And I think that the whole team has been executing very well this quarter, and that's what you see.  And we have also done other type of partnership, and that's part of our network-as-a-service strategy that we outlined in the beginning of the year. So I think you see that we see a possibility of continued to grow even in the 4G area, and I think that's important.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. And Brett, if I would just add on a couple of points. You mentioned us having a growth posture. We've really been leaning forward for over a couple of years now. From when we launched unlimited, we've been continuing to update our Consumer offerings, our customer offerings. You see those resonate. It's built on the backbone of having the best network experience. So this is an ongoing process that you've seen from us over the past couple of years. And you should expect us to stay on the front foot going forward.  In terms of -- you mentioned investment in growth. If you look at the wireless numbers as a whole, so -- as you say, very strong growth. But when you adjust out for the accounting, our EBITDA margin was in line with last year. So it's a great performance from the team that we can focus on growth and continue to report strong margins. So it's well-balanced there as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick: How effective were the new plans in driving more subs to unlimited? I heard you mention you still have 50% or so. And I appreciate the commentary on service revenue on 4Q. What does that tell us about unlimited take rates and moving up or down tiers?\nHans Vestberg: In general as I said, for us, it's a way for seeing that our customer get the best value. They can mix and match. I think that resonates well with the marketplace that you can do it. I think that, as Matt said, we have been on the forefoot since unlimited come out in new ways of both offering, but also giving a wide breadth of opportunities for our wireless customers. So I think that's what we're seeing.  And as you heard from Matt, that means we come in with a good momentum in the fourth quarter, and our wireless service revenue is now increasing our guidance for the fourth quarter. But remember also, it's both Consumer, and we're doing very well on the Business side as well. I think that Tami and the team are doing great [indiscernible] on wireless. And then if you see the numbers, we continue to do really solid work across the board here.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Yes. And to follow on from that point, if you think about the 444,000 phone net adds we had in the quarter, we had more than 200,000 in each of the Consumer and Business segments. So that wireless growth is very well balanced across the totality of our customer portfolio, which is very good to see. You mentioned the unlimited percentage. Prior couple of quarters, we were saying we're still less than 50%. This quarter, we had approximately 50%. The new plans give people -- a lot have moved up to unlimited, a great opportunity to do so. We're seeing them do that. There's still plenty of space and more customers to come there, Phil, and as you see the service revenue guide for the quarter. And obviously when you have increase in net adds, that gives us greater confidence around service revenues as we look into the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: I guess a couple for Matt on the financials. I think, Matt, we saw a kind of spike in wireless cost of service in the quarter kind of anomaly I think relative to history that it could have -- wireless margins could have been a lot -- even better. If you could kind of address that spike, it will be helpful. And then similarly on the flip side on wireline, kind of almost a 2 percentage point sequential step down in wireline margins. I know you mentioned that we've hit the full run rate from the voluntary departure plan, which I thought would have kind of supported that. So could you kind of walk us through what happened in the wireline margin side, too?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. So on the wireless cost of service side, I mentioned that the phone net adds split was fairly even between Consumer and Business. Business had a more than 10% increase in phone gross adds. And as you are aware, our -- a lot of our Business customers are still on a subsidy model rather than device payment model, so I think you see the impact of that. But as I said earlier, we had great growth in the quarter in wireless. And overall margins were in line with a year ago. So we are very happy with the balance of that performance between growth and the margins.  On the wireline side, obviously, we still have work to do there as you look at wireline. Certainly, we see the continued effect of the revenue declines in legacy products. That's not new. We've had that for a number of quarters, and we expect that's obviously going to continue.  The key for us in wireline is to develop products and services that will offset those legacy products and services. And by bringing the Business segment together where we're bringing both wireless and wireline products to our Business customers holistically, this puts us in a better position to really be that partner of choice for our Business customers as we move into a 5G world. So as we develop those product and services, we look forward to seeing what comes from those segments as we go forward.\nHans Vestberg: And I can only add on the wireline side there, the whole transformation we're doing with the new segments is, of course, paving the way for actually thinking about the customer. This customer extremely important for the digital transformation when it comes to private 5G networks, to mobile edge compute in the future. So the customer relationship is very important there.  And secondly, as Matt said, the investment that we're doing in the network right now with mobile edge compute with fiber and all of that, that's of course things that are going to offset that all the time. It's not immediate because we have a secular decline on the product portfolio. It's known, and -- but we constantly work with the front end of it, and I think that putting together what we have done is really, really good. I mean I have, together with Tami and the team, visited, I would say the majority of all the large Fortune 50 companies in this country right now and talking about our offerings and what we can do for them in the future. I think we had a really good a good start there, but it will take some time.  So I think this is a very, very important asset that we have, that we need to work on it. That's why we're taking out cost to do it all the time. As I said, it will not be an immediate recovery, and we will -- but I think we have plans for the future to really do this well. And I see so much encouraging signs just lately on how we work with this, so yes, that's where we are with wireline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Two questions. First, anything you guys can tell us about the financial impact to the Disney partnership? And then more specifically, what kind of lift are you guys seeing from an ARPU standpoint as you guys get sort of non-unlimited customers moving up to unlimited? And then second, could we talk about use of cash as you guys get to your leverage targets? It looks like you're going to get below -- at or below 2x sometime early next year. How do you prioritize your returns of cash to shareholders versus sort of other needs, like spectrum for instance? And is there a chance that we could see buybacks come back into the cards next year?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. If we start with the Disney+ agreement. I think, first of all, we learn to look from our exclusive agreement without the music. Both how we do these as a win-win for both the partner and us. And remember, we are I would say fairly picky who we do this type of partnership. We do with the best brand, with great products. The same go for Disney+.  Remember, we are offering a lot to these companies as well. I mean we offer a base, solid distribution that no one else has in this country, definitely the best customer base at the same time, the best network. So I think it's a much more win-win than you might believe as I hear your questions coming out. I think that we are offering something fantastic for them. At the same time, as you well pointed out, we have a chance right now to move our customers in our value chain of unlimited again given that we are adding these types of things.  So I think we have a good metrics. We have a good experience from app and music that we now take to the streaming, and we're going to have a win-win. It's going to be great for Disney. It's going to be good for us. So I think that's what we have. On the capital allocation, I mean as Matt said, first of all, we invest on our business. Our CapEx, whatever tuck-ins we need, that's really #1 priority right now. Secondly, we're putting our Board in a good position to continue to increase the dividend, 13 years in a row all dividend increase. We want to have them in that.  And then, of course, we continue to do our commitment, which was to get back to pre-Vodafone ratings and pre-Vodafone measurements. So we're doing that. That's what we execute all the day. And yes, we're getting very close, and we will give a lot of opportunities for the Board in the next step to think about what they want to do. And that's what Matt and I are doing and the whole treasury team, which I think is doing an excellent job. So that's where we are with the capital allocation.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. If I will just add a couple of things to that, Hans. And I would say while we're not going to provide any more details about specifically where we'll be next year, you should not expect us to want to aim to go outside the bottom end of that range, below the 1.75, and you should not expect us to build significant cash balance on the balance sheet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Hans, I wanted to talk on 5G a little bit. You rolled out the new standards-based 5G Home in Chicago. Can you just give us a little bit of color about what difference that makes and how aggressively you're going to lean into this in terms of new markets and households until you get the next generation with the new chipsets? And then related to that, you've got a number of 5G Ultra Wideband devices in your handset mix. Obviously, you're waiting for the iPhone. But how do you see that -- those devices penetrating your subscriber base over the last few months? And what does the pipeline look for new devices with that capability over the next few months?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you very much. When it comes to the 5G Home that we launched now with the NR standard, that was an important thing for us because as you remember, we launched in 4 cities with our proprietary software. Now we have it on the global standard software. So that's an important event for us. And the second important event though of these launches, that we are now having the cell set-up. Remember, we had a North Star, how we want to do this so differently. So yes, you are right, we are launching this, and it's a lot of new experience that we're giving to our consumers but also that we are now taking as we have been working since the early launch on the first 4 cities.  As you rightfully point out and I said several times as well, that there's coming a next-generation chipset in the second half of 2020. That's really when we think we're going to have a more massive deployment of it. And until then, we are deploying in the millimeter wave with the ultra wideband in so many cities. So when we get that more -- the next-generation CPE, then based on the next-generation chipset, we're going to be in a very good position second half to actually come out much wider. So this is just the next step for us to get all the insights, billing, experience for our consumers, so we can really take a big step when it come to the next-generation chipset.  When it comes to the smartphones, as you rightfully said, we have launched all the iconic 5G phones so far this year. We see an exciting take up on that because many of our customers are taking the phones. And even if you have not launched all cities, they are preparing. So we are paving the way for them because many of these phones are also extremely good 4G phones, and as soon as we come with 5G for that city, they will also have that. So that we see on us Brian Higgins that is leading our device organization has said basically all phones coming out next year will be 5G capable. So we will have a range of phones coming out next year. There's one brand that we don't know, and we haven't talked about them, and again, they need to talk about when they will have a 5G phone. But all others will basically have their phones coming out.  So I feel good about it, the performance has gone up dramatically. I mean if I look at the Galaxy coming out, the Samsung Galaxy, which is one of the first phones where in the beginning, we tune up to 500, 600 megabits per second, which we thought was great. That's doing 2 gig right now constantly in the ultra wideband. So we see also a clear improvement on the software tuning between the network and the handsets. And as we deploy more and more, we're just getting better and better and giving a better and better experience for our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.\nMichael Rollins: How do you see the pricing model evolving with 5G in terms of the opportunity to charge by rate of speed instead of by the current model, which are unlimited per gigabytes or a certain quantum of gigabytes?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Of course, as we get into 5G, you get a fair amount of new potential ways of charging. I still think that our model for unlimited is really both helping us and our consumers to go to actually move up in the value chain from getting into the, let's say, the lower tier of unlimited coming up to the sort of the highest. It's a wide range and, of course, the highest is including 5G. Today, we're waiving that, but all time we see that if you're going to get that ubiquitous sort of coverage and capacity, and -- that will give us an opportunity.  At the same time, we started adding our flexibility in our business model, having Apple Music, having Disney+ and all of that in the same time. So I think that we have a lot of tools in our portfolio to continue to drive this forward. And I think that as I always say, I have a lot of confidence in the Consumer team. And as they have come together today, you see clearly new potentials. I mean remember we have 5G Home coming, we have 5G Mobility at the same time. There's a lot of things that can be done for us to continue to this journey. And I think that one of the proof points of the whole new structure is, of course, also that Disney+ is not only for mobility, it's for our Fios customers, and it's for our 5G Home customers. And suddenly, we think about Consumer as a full segment, which I think it was the whole idea with the new structure we have.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.\nTimothy Horan: Hans, can you give us maybe some more thoughts what you think people are going to do with gigabit speeds instead of megabits? When we rolled out 4G, we had a lot of new innovative kind of applications. Just any thoughts on that as you're talking to the Fortune 500 companies. And are there ways for you maybe to participate in some of the revenue from some of these new applications with lower -- also maybe lower latency? Just any more thoughts what you're seeing on use cases.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. I think that is an excellent question. I mean the first, which is a totally new business model, is 5G Home. That's a totally new way how we use the technology, which we have never been able to do before because a stand-alone fixed wireless access can never be sustainable financially. In this case, it is.  Then of course when you think about the 8 currencies coming out from 5G, I think that our conversation with the large enterprises today is a lot about the latency and the mobile edge compute. Because suddenly, you can transform your factory with robotics by having a low latency. You don't need a wired factory, so the future digital factory will have 5G. We see also much bigger 5G private networks, where you get security much higher because it's going to be your network. You define your network, you have a compute and storage for your enterprise. This is a new way of charging and actually interacting with our customer. And sometimes, there's going to be a software in between that come from a software company, so we need to work with them as well.  And as I said earlier, I mean this quarter, we're going to launch our first 5G mobile edge compute center. So we are on the path of doing this, which actually will add more opportunity. Then on the Consumer side, which usually question starts with, which are now end with because I see so many other opportunities, is of course AR/VR. We see now quite a lot of money coming into the ventures side when it comes to 5G innovation. And I think that as we move into 2020, we're going to see much more. We have our 5G challenge, which we announced at CES where we had a lot of companies participate what they're going to do with 5G. It ranged from everything what they can do with 5G.  I think we're at the moment of 4G, but way bigger. When 4G came, I didn't know what type of application and new service companies would show up. I think this is far bigger that we're standing in front of right now, and we have much more insights to it as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.\nColby Synesael: Two questions, if I may. Number one, can you talk about the revenue impact of the step-up in the insurance fee on a full year basis and the amount you expect to reinvest in things like promos and marketing and things like Disney+, so we can get a better sense of the net benefit to the company? And then secondly, given the slower deployment for small cells, not fiber, but for small cells that's being seen really across the industry, are you considering shifting more of your investment dollars back to the macro network as we shift into 2020?\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the second question. I'm not sure where you say is slow. The definition what is a small cell is, number one, I mean I'm not sure there is a good definition on that. Of course we deploy a lot of urban cells right now. In my book, that's actually small cell, so I don't think you're referring to us when you talk about less deployment because we are in the midst of our 5G deployment right now, which is very focused on the dense urban places where there's no macros, it's small cells. But it depends on what you define as a small cell. They're everything from micro to medium-sized hybrids to the macros. And -- but in our case, it's not that we're slowing down anything here.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So Colby, on the question on the revenue impact of the step-up in our insurance products, Total Mobile Protection, from a geography standpoint, that's in the other revenue line, so that the contribution from that step-up is not in the service revenue line. But as you say, it's -- you saw a good increase in that line in the quarter. We continue to add value to our customers. It's an example of how we think about the Consumer offering holistically, whether that be the core service and having it on the best network; whether it be bringing value like we have this year, first with Apple Music and now with Disney+; and how we bring other services, such as Total Mobile Protection, cloud storage, et cetera, et cetera. So we continue to look for those opportunities to add value for our customers. And as we do that, you see the impact on revenue, and you see the impact on volume. So coming out of the third quarter, very strong volumes, great momentum coming out of the quarter, and we've seen that continued strong momentum here in October as we start the fourth quarter and head into the holiday season.  So all of those things that we're doing around the customer proposition are really driving a lot of positive trajectory for the business right now. We have good line of sight for that continuing as we go forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson: So for Disney+, you're the national partner for Disney, and the impact for both of you is highly dependent upon getting Verizon customers to sign up and use Disney+. What would you consider a good conversion rate for unlimited customers to Disney+ customers? And should we benchmark it to Apple Music usage? And any sort of go-to-market strategy commentary around that would be interesting. But also, you're proving that you could partner with great content, and I do -- I'm interested in your comments on the benefit of owning media and then particularly the Verizon Media Group.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you very much. No, I think that it's a little bit different, of course, Apple Music from Disney+ given that the Disney+ is, of course, a heavy streaming and Apple Music is a fairly light audio. So of course, it also -- when you think about the conversion rate, you need also to understand you need to be on unlimited when you come up to this one and moving up in unlimited. So of course, it might be a little bit lower conversion rate. But I still think that our team knows this very well right now. We do the co-marketing. It's great for our customers. It creates loyalty, but not only that, we give something more for our customers. So I think that we have a good -- we're not giving away the conversion rates right now, and I think that will put more pressure on Disney than us. So I think that that's a -- but I think we have a good grip on it.  When it comes to our -- my -- or our view on content, I think that first of all, when it comes to streamed content or linear content and then all of that, I think that we are -- we like the model we have. We have a lot of flexibility. We partner with the best. We offer our asset so you're going to see us doing that in the right places. But anyhow, Verizon Media Group fits very well into our because what we see they are doing is of course over-the-top sort of Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, Yahoo Entertainment, Yahoo! News, all of that is over-the-top services. Where we get engagement, we learn how content is working. And of course, then we have our advertising platform then that is getting then owned and operated content that drives the flywheel of our advertising platform. So it all sinks in.  And then you -- we also need to have that a lot of the content that we now are trialing out for 5G is coming from our Verizon Media Group because one of the first 5G labs we have actually inside Verizon Media Group for them to be innovating on the next-generation content, with animation, and holograms and whatever you can think about. So we have good synergy between Verizon Media Group and our network business, which is extremely crucial for our success going forward.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners.\nMichael McCormack: Hans, maybe just a quick comment on the wireless side. Obviously, very strong phone adds in the quarter. Just from a competitive landscape, are you seeing a share-taking opportunity here with, I guess, potentially Sprint and T-Mobile -- I don't want to call it distracted, but obviously quite busy. And how that situation might change as you go through 2020?  Then secondly, I guess for Hans also, on the wireline side, are there any opportunities to carve out some of those assets? I know we've been talking about this for years. But anything that you can see out there that might make sense? And then maybe just one last one for Matt on the legacy pricing pressure within wireline. What exactly are seeing? Maybe just elaborate on what you're seeing as far as pricing pressures go.\nHans Vestberg: So when it comes to the wireless, and the -- first of all, we think the third quarter was very similar in -- the competitive landscape in the third quarter was very similar to the second quarter. I mean there were some iconic launches there. So first of all, it is a competitive market. We need to remember that. It's just that we are having -- we are on the forefoot right now, as Matt said. We have a good chance to continue to monetize on that, then I think we have a good, compelling network and customer offerings. So I think that's what is important for us.  Of course, as I've said before, the landscape will change in the future here when it comes to competition. Our strategy will not change. How we are executing right now will be the same. We'll continue to go hard on the network, seeing that the customer-centric organization that we have is really making the right decision for our customer, creating the products they want. So I think that that's what we're going to do, and we're going to have the flexibility to see market opportunities that we saw in the third quarter. We move on them, and we are preparing our structure, our products and our organization for doing that.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, Mike. On the wireline side, the legacy pricing pressures that you questioned about. I mean obviously, we're seeing the pressure, both from volume and a pricing standpoint. It's not really dissimilar to what we've seen in the past few quarters, but that's going to continue as customers continue to transition to fiber-based services. That's why we have been doing -- rolling out more fiber, as you know in our One Fiber initiative that's going to give us more opportunities to sell into those customers as they move off of legacy products. And our fiber build has continued to gain momentum, increased a little bit in third quarter of over 1,500 route miles a month on average in the quarter. So we're getting to a good momentum there, and that will open up additional opportunities for us as we go forward to replace those legacy volumes.\nMichael McCormack: Hey, Matt, any comment just on the wireline assets? Anything out there that might be interesting?\nMatthew Ellis: No. I think we've done a good job over the years. And when you look at the assets we have now, they fit within the portfolio. Obviously, if anything comes up, we continue to look but nothing major that we see immediately in front of us there.\nBrady Connor: Hey, look that's all the time we have for questions today. Before we end the call, I want to hand it back over to Hans for a few closing comments.\nHans Vestberg: So a quick summary. I mean as I said in the beginning, I mean, I'm satisfied how the team have executed on our strategy in this quarter. We continue to execute well on our network, 4G and 5G, and One Fiber, as Matt talked about. Our customer-centric model is starting to pay off big time with the concerted offerings in the market, both for Verizon Business Group, Verizon Media Group and Verizon Consumer Group. You continue to see us hammering on the leadership in 5G, very important for us. A lot of headway or a lot of progress in this quarter especially, and now 50 markets up, 13 NFL stadiums, a couple of arenas that host both hockey and basketball as well. So -- and 5G Home coming out. So continued progress there. We have more to do in the fourth quarter, which is exciting. And then, of course, we continue with the discipline in the financial environment that we're all in and executing very carefully but also taking opportunities when we see them in the marketplace. So all in all, I'm pleased with the quarter, and we are happy with the momentum that we're creating going into the fourth quarter. So thank you very much for being on the call today.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, everyone.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-08-01 12:38:08", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brett. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor and I'm here with Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the second quarter of 2019, we reported earnings of $0.95 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion related to early debt redemption costs. The impact after tax was approximately $1.1 billion or $0.28 per share, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.23. This represents growth of 2.5% on an adjusted basis compared to $1.20 a year ago. Let's now move to slide four and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the second quarter. Consistent with the approach we discussed last quarter, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition as well as the adoption of ASC 842 for leases. As we pointed out last quarter, we expect a smaller benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction and benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share. The impact was a $0.03 headwind in the quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. As a reminder, this headwind is expected to continue until the end of 2020. At the beginning of this year, we adopted accounting standard ASC 842 for leases, which resulted in the gross-up on the balance sheet for all operating leases. In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share, primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs. As highlighted previously, we expect this result in a $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter headwind on earnings per share throughout 2019. For the second quarter, this headwind was $0.01 on the earnings per share. As you can see on the slide, the 2.5% growth in adjusted EPS includes both the impacts from the deferral of commission expense related to the revenue recognition standard and the adoption of the leasing standard. This highlights the strong underlying performance of the business. Matt will take you through the details and key drivers later in the call. With that I'll now turn the call over to Hans. \nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Brady, and thanks, everybody, for joining this second quarter earnings call. We had a strong second quarter. It was fueled by a very good wireless service revenue growth as well as a strong EPS -- adjusted EPS growth as well. So I think the team had a good quarter with a lot of focus on the execution. At the same time our operation metrics was good with net additions on the wireless side, as well as a very low churn. That in combination with a very solid capital allocation, as well as efficiency coming out from our capital allocation process, all-in-all all stranded up to a very good cash flow. So if I sum it up very quickly, a very good quarter from us financially. Together with our work in the network which is so important to us when we're building our network as a service, we also won all the top third-party measurements. We won from J.D. Power, the 23rd consecutive time, when account the RootMetrics, the 12th straight win there as well. So we are really getting the right feedback from the market and the measurements that is really valuable in this market. At the same time, we won some more spectrum in the millimeter-wave auction, which is now adding up to our portfolio which means that we have a portfolio for the 5G-era where we can build capacity and we can build coverage, which we said all the time, we want to be in the real 5G with all the 8 currencies that I've talked about before. We also have launched quite a lot of CTLs lately adding up, so we are on-track for the 30 markets that we have said we will do this year. At the same time we continue to add new devices to the portfolio, the latest one was the Inseego, MiFi and 5G device that we launched recently and we're now four different devices on 5G. We're also very focused on the fiber because ultimately if you're going to the 5G, you need fiber. Our fiber deployment is now in more than 60 cities and we had 1,400 route miles a month in average in this quarter which means that we increase on the first quarter continued this so important build for our overall Intelligent Edge Network and for the 5G deployment we're doing. When it comes to Verizon 2.0 won a transformation one of the proof points of course today that we now are reporting Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group as segments in the earnings release that we're doing today. I can also say that, we get a lot of good traction with our customers especially with enterprise customers with the new support and the new go-to-market we have, where we can show the full portfolio of Verizon and seeing that we have the right support also for the people in the line, meeting our customers everyday. At the same time we continued Network as a service concept, where we are now announced our collaboration with YouTube TV where we're going to offer up both our Fios customers, but also the wireless customers. Again working on the motto where we outlined earlier this year, how we can partner with some of these content players instead of investing ourselves in it and seeing that we can bring your seamless service for our customer, but also making it very efficient for ourselves and for our customers. We also have continued and finalized the Voluntary Separation Program in the quarter and we have done quite a lot of that and that in total now puts us up to have a competitive cost base and actually down quite a lot of these changes recently. So I would say that we are doing this transformation from a positional strength, and I'm really proud of the team that have done all of these changes and transformation in the last 12 months and delivering these results at the same time. And it really sets us up for continue to be very competitive in this market and definitely continue to be the leader in this market. So, I'm proud of the team and what we're producing this quarter. By that, I hand it over to Matt to go over the financials more in detail.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a recap of our consolidated operating and financial results. On a reported basis, second quarter consolidated revenue was $32.1 billion, which was down slightly as compared to the prior year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and wireline service revenue. On a year-to-date basis, consolidated revenue is up slightly at 0.4%. We are maintaining our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth for 2019. On a consolidated basis, second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.7%, which was up from 36.8% in the prior year and includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the impact of the lease accounting standard that Brady mentioned earlier. Adjusted EBITDA increased more than $200 million or 1.8% over the prior year due to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business. Our business excellence initiatives have realized cumulative cash savings of $4.1 billion since the program started in 2018. We have now completed all three phases of our Voluntary Separation Program and have realized approximately $480 million of expense savings year-to-date. With the last tranche of employees exiting in late June, we expect additional incremental savings in the third quarter. We remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021. As Brady mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23, up from $1.20 a year ago. The increase in our earnings per share was driven by growth of more than $200 million in adjusted EBITDA slightly offset by a higher tax rate. The higher tax rate resulted in an approximately $0.01 headwind to adjusted earnings per share. As a reminder last year's tax rate included certain one-time benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which do not repeat this year. For 2019, our adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to come in at the lower end of the 24% to 26% range. Continued wireless service revenue momentum and solid margin performance keep us on track to achieve our guidance of low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. Our expectation of the lease accounting headwind remains unchanged to approximately $0.04 to $0.08 for full year 2019. Now, let's move on to the review of the new operating segments under Verizon 2.0 starting with consumer on slide 7. As a reminder, our new consumer segment encompasses both wireless and wireline products and services targeting retail customers as well as our wireless wholesale operations. In the second quarter, total consumer operating revenue was $22.0 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. These results were primarily driven by continued strong growth in wireless service revenue and file service offerings offset by declines in wireless equipment and legacy wireline services. Consumer wireless service revenue increased by 2.5%, driven by customer step-ups to unlimited plans and migration within Unlimited to higher tier plans as well as an increase in connections per account. Less than 50% of our customer account base are on unlimited plans. In the second quarter consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 8.2% as lower upgrade rates more than offset an increase in phone gross adds. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.2% due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings. Consumer EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 46.5%, which was up 80 basis points from the prior year. This includes headwinds of approximately 100 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and a new lease accounting standard as previously mentioned. Let's now turn to slide 8 and take a closer look at consumer operating metrics. Within consumer, wireless performance is very strong, while operating in a highly competitive environment. Phone net additions were 73,000 for the quarter as compared to 17,000 last year including postpaid smartphone net additions of 209,000, up 17% from the prior year. This was driven by phone gross additions, which are up more than 5% year-over-year. Postpaid net additions totaled 126,000 including other connected device net additions of 187,000, primarily wearables offset by tablet net losses of 134,000. Postpaid phone churn of 0.72% improved sequentially due to focused retention efforts around our high-value customer base as well as normal seasonal patterns. This performance was in line with last year strong results. Our superior network quality and personalized offerings continue to resonate with our customers. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.97% was up compared to 0.93% last year. Total postpaid device activations, of which 81% were phones, were down 7.6%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.3%, down from 5. 1% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle. In the second quarter, prepaid net losses were 213,000 compared to a loss of 236,000 last year. We continue to focus on high-value account and profitability in our retail prepaid wireless offerings. Fios Internet net additions of 28,000 were driven by continued demand for our high-quality fiber broadband products. Fios Video losses totaled 52,000 as consumers continue to adopt over-the-top video services to replace traditional linear video offerings. Now let's move to our business segment on slide 9. Our business segment includes wireless and wireline products and services provided across four customer groups; Global Enterprise, Small and Medium Business, Wholesale and Public Sector and Other, which includes Verizon Connect. Total operating revenues for the business segment decreased 1.1% in the quarter as growth in wireless services and our high-quality fiber products were offset by ongoing secular pressure from legacy technologies. In the quarter, revenue from our business wireless products grew 5.6% including 6.1% wireless service revenue growth. This strong performance reflects Verizon's best-in-class network quality, reliability and solutions-based approach with our business customers. Revenue from our wireline products declined 7.6% in the quarter. From a Customer Group perspective, Global Enterprise and wholesale declined 4.8% and 15.1% respectively, driven primarily by legacy pricing pressure and technology shifts. Small and medium business revenue increased 5.4% driven by wireless service and Fios growth partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services. Public sector and other revenue increased 3.8% as a result of growth in wireless and wireline products and services. Business segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 27.3% which was down 20 basis points compared to the prior year driven by declines in legacy wireline product revenues. This includes headwinds of approximately 10 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard as previously mentioned. Now let's move on to slide 10 to discuss business operating metrics. Business wireless is transforming consistent and strong. Postpaid net adds were 325,000 which includes 172,000 phones 90,000 tablets and 63,000 other connected devices. Phone churn of 0.97% improved sequentially, while total postpaid churn of 1.21% increased 5 basis points compared to the prior year. Total postpaid device activations were up slightly at 0.6%, while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.2% down from 4.6% in the prior year. Let's now move on to slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the second quarter Verizon Media Group revenue is $1.8 billion which was down 2.9% versus the prior year, a significant improvement from the 7.2% year-over-year decline reported in the first quarter. Gains in native and mobile advertising continue to be offset by declines in desktop advertising though the business continues to build on positive momentum in key areas. We are continuing to migrate customers to our recently integrated advertising platforms, simplifying interactions with partners and driving synergies within the business. We remain focused on growing our audience, engagement and monetization across our super channels which includes sports, finance, news, entertainment, home and mail. During the quarter we launched Yahoo! Finance Premium and HuffPost Plus which is a subscription services that enhance the experience of two of our most popular media assets. Let's now move to slide 12, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we mentioned during our Verizon 2.0 segment reporting webcast in mid June, we will be providing overall wireless and wireline results through the remainder of this year. You can find these results in our supplemental information included on our website. Slide 12 shows a reconciliation from Verizon 2.0 to Verizon 1.0 for both consumer and business revenue. The voice full chart shows the bridge from consumer revenue to wireless and from business revenue to wireline. The top chart shows consumer which had $22.0 billion of revenue in the quarter. The subtraction of consumer wireline removes $3.1 billion and the addition of business wireless brings in $3.8 billion resulting in total wireless revenues of $22.7 billion. The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from business to wireline revenue. We start with business revenue of $7.8 billion subtract $3.8 billion of business wireless and $0.2 billion of Verizon Connect and then add $3.1 billion of consumer wireline to ultimately arrive at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter. Total wireline operating revenues in the quarter declined 4.5% while wireline margins were 19.3%. Let's move to slide 13, which highlights our overall legacy wireless results. Looking at overall wireless results, which includes both consumer and business wireless, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.0% to $22.7 billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by a 3.1% increase in service revenue. For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect overall wireless service revenue growth to be within the mid 2% to 3% range. Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 48.2%. This includes headwinds of approximately 100 basis points, primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standards as previously mentioned. Excluding the impact from the accounting standards, second quarter EBITDA margin was 49.2%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. Total postpaid net adds were 451,000 in the quarter. This includes phone net adds of 245,000, which were up from 199,000 a year ago. Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter were 420,000. Postpaid phone churn of 0.76% was similar to last year while total retail postpaid churn of 1.02% was up five basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, we increased customer accounts by 8,000 as compared to a loss of 24,000 in the second quarter of last year. Total postpaid device activations were down 5.7%. This was driven by an increase in postpaid growth additions of 3.9 million from 3.8 million in the prior year offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 4.3% from 5.0% a year ago. Let's now focus on our consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on slide 14. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $15.8 billion, down from $16.4 billion during the prior year. Benefits from operational improvements were offset by a higher cash tax payments and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. The one-time benefits realized last year related to tax reform were primarily recognized in the first half of 2018. Capital spending for the first half of the year was $8.0 billion, which is up slightly from the prior year. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in data and video traffic on our industry leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network, the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint. We maintain our full-year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion. The net results of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of total gross debt, which is $1.3 billion lower than the prior year. The unsecured debt balance was $102.1 billion which is lower year-over-year by $3.9 billion and lower sequentially by $1.2 billion. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0 times and is down from 2.3 times last year, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet. We continue to actively manage our debt portfolio to minimize near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital. During the quarter we tendered $4.5 billion of notes that resulted in the pretax charge of $1.5 billion that Brady mentioned earlier. The charge is predominantly non-cash. Our balance sheet strength provide us with financial flexibility to execute on our strategy. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels giving us confidence to operate and invest throughout the business cycle. So in summary, second quarter saw a continuation of our strong performance while we made the transition to Verizon 2.0. We grew customer relationships and increased service revenues. The growth in our earnings was driven by operational performance from the business which also led to strong cash flow results for the quarter. We continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation and we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady, so we can get to your questions. \nBrady Connor: Thanks, Matt. Brad, we're now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks guys. One short term and one long-term, if I may. First your 2.5% to 3% service revenue growth guide seems very conservative at this point versus 2.7% on the first half. Are there headwinds in the back half that we should think will get the average down below 3%? And second, Hans can you dig more into the 60 market fiber build? And help us understand any early progress on in-sourcing backhaul, as well as when you will start marketing that to consumer or business out of region? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Let me start with the wireless service growth and then Matt will come back on that. But I think that, the team has really shown a really good work here in the last couple of quarters since, I would say, we have this new structure. I'm confident we have a good momentum in our business. Rolling on the team probably have some more quarters up their sleeves, thinking how they will continue to compete in this market. So we think it's our at least, I have a lot of confidence in the team we\u2019re rolling on and continue to progress on the service revenue growth that we have done so far. On the fiber build, yes that's a very important build for us. And we have been on for that for quite a while right now and the speed in this quarter was 1400 route miles per month in average in the quarter. Remember in the first quarter we talked about 1000, so definitely everywhere coming up. Right now the majority of the fiber is going to our own sites to build, if I may say. But over time of course when we roll in later in part of this year next year, we're also going to be able to offer that to our enterprise customers and wholesale et cetera. So that's how we're working right now and we're building it in 60 more and because it is just so essential for the whole Intelligent Edge Network, it's so essential for the whole 5G play that we have to have this fiber. So we have a good speed now. The team has been there on for quite a while, and so it will take a little bit longer before we can offer it to all our customers. But mainly I would say we're right now we're taking to our own sites, which is very important improvement for our efficiency. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. So good morning Phil. So on the service revenue, certainly pleased with the results we've seen in the first half of the year, 3.1% in second quarter, driven by over 6% in the business segment. So great momentum in the wireless products and services across both segments as we head into the second half of the year. We like the momentum we have as we jump off into second half and we'll wait and see how the back half of the year plays out in terms of the total service revenue growth. We certainly see a continued path to continue on the service revenue growth we've had for over a year or so now.\nPhilip Cusick: And Hans if I can follow-up the in-sourcing of your backhaul as you take fiber to your sites, has that really begun to start lowering cost, or are you not starting to light that up yet?\nHans Vestberg: We have been starting, but of course today on the total cost we have, it's not significant yet. But this is all part of the Intelligent Edge Network, the multipurpose network we're building and that's what you're seeing in our CapEx, the last two years the efficiencies. And as you remember Kyle talked about the Intelligence Edge network build is going a couple of year more. So we, of course, believe that we have more efficient as it come out and one of them is definitely the fiber, which we're now building that definitely should get a their own economics long-term and also remember that -- also that this is a growth opportunity for us as well in certain areas.\nPhilip Cusick: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Phil. Hey, Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the questions. This one's for Matt. As you show on slide 14, you're getting very close to achieving the net unsecured leverage target you outlined at your analyst meeting a couple of months ago. Is it a question as you get down to two churns of leverage and below, how do you think about prioritizing the incremental capital you'll be generating at that point? Should we think about that as dry powder for spectrum, which you may be look to flex up on CapEx a bit, or are we actually getting closer to a point where share repurchases become a higher and more immediate priority? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: So let me start here and this is of course something that me and Matt is working with confidence. Remember what we outlined in February, we're very clear and disciplined where our capital allocation. Number one into the business, the CapEx you have seen what we have done with the CapEx the last couple of years. We do everything we need and we are on historical levels and we will continue to be very disciplined there. Secondly, we want to put our Board in a position to make a dividend that we have been working and ultimately we work with our debt. That's how we work all the time. So it\u2019s business, dividend and debt. And we -- want to continue this commitment that we made to get into this range and remember that was a commitment longer before me, but as you know we are company to always deliver on the commitments. So that's why it's important and ultimately we will get there. We will get optionality to our board to have a great conversation what we\u2019re going to do with it. That's how I see it. And then of course Matt is working with this daily to see that we have the right balance sheet structure and the capital allocation of the company. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes Hans. So thanks for those points. And just building may be on the back end of that. So as you said Brett, we are -- we're as close as we\u2019ve been to that range in the past 5-plus years. And \u2013 so, we're making good progress to get there and that comes from having strong results that drive good cash flow and you see the progress we've been able to make. But just a couple of add-on points to what Hans said. It's a range that we say we want to be instead of long term. That means, we don't want to go past the 1.75 end of that range either. And so get into the range and then be in the range. And then we also don't expect to build up cash on the balance sheet beyond our normal operating level. So as we get into the range we look at the opportunities priority number one, which is to invest in the business and the rest of the items that Hans talk about. We'll then decide the most appropriate use of cash that we may have to drive long-term value for our shareholders.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: All right. Thanks Brett. Hey Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks. Good morning. Hans I wonder if you could update us a little bit more on here 5G. You talked a bit about opening up the new mobile broadband market. Perhaps if you can talk about your learning so far and where we stand on expanding 5G Home? I think you've talked before about new markets later this year and dynamic spectrum sharing. How is that panning out? And when do we expect to see that hitting the Verizon network? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks. Great questions. So on the 5G, you have seen our progress in the quarter. We have basically now launched nine markets on the way to get to the 30 that we have talked about for the full year. You can also see on the 5G Mobility, how the improvements has gone extremely fast. I mean, take a couple of the cities where we basically have doubled the footprint in this since we launched the markets and that's this pace we're onto. At the same time we are going from roughly having 600 megabits in speed on the handset now we're doing easily 1.3, 1.5 and averaging up to 2 gig. What I want to tell you is that the development we're doing on technology is actually extremely fast compared to what I saw in 4G. And remember I was part of 4G as well. I mean we are here to quarter into all these nine markets we have launched, we have launched with all the three infrastructure vendors we have which means that, we are coming out from sort of your scaling in the beginning, getting all the technology to work and now again starts our scaling. At the same time we are now three handsets and we have the Inseego MiFi that we launched which is sort of a business proposition as well for 5G. So I think that, that's what you see. We see a great improvement. But still it's a lot of the intelligent antenna sort of technology that we're developing. The team is out in the field every day. So I'm confident that we will continue to do well here. And remember now in 5G out of wideband that we're doing right now. We're doing that in the most dense populated areas where really 5G is coming to its right, you know, with a fantastic sort of the performance there. So that's it. When we then talk about the 5G Home, you're absolutely right. I said that later this year we're going to launch 5G or 5G Home with and/or chipset. So that will come back, so there's no changes to those plans. Ultimately your question about DSS, which is dynamic spectrum sharing, which is an important piece for anyone that wants to do coverage on 5G. That is still coming in the first half of next year. But in our case what I said before, the most important is to get our customer the best experience. We have the best experience on 4G right now. We are just giving an extraordinary experience on the Ultra Wideband. We're going to be in the position to give optionality when we turn that off/on and we're going to turn it on with coverage and capacity when we see it's a benefit for our customers. But I would say the activity level in the engineering team, the team working on the ground in every city, doing the fiber is extremely high in Verizon right now. So I think our focus is absolutely in the right place to see that our network is the number one. I remember also what I said previously, the 4G network now continue to win all the third-party awards. I mean, RootMetrics, J.D. Power in this quarter, so we're not neglecting that part neither. So you need to think about that when you have a customer in front of you.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Simon. Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. One for Matt. If we're guiding for the low end of the tax rate for 2019, should we be then thinking that we're steering our earnings per share growth up, or are there other things in the mix that we shouldn't be taking that improvement right to the bottom line? And then the second question would be, just with respect to the legacy 1.0 reporting for the business segment. I think one of the surprises that came out of the AT&T result was the strength that they showed relative to history in the enterprise business and they talked about price stability, and other things I think Randall said that this was good at outlook as you have for that unit for some time. I think that the performance that Verizon didn't seem to kind of reflect the same strength. But I'm wondering if it had something to do with the reorganization in the quarter and we should start to see some improvement there. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit on that? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. I can start with the last question there about the business side of it. And I think that when it comes to what you called out the wireline business, I mean it was little bit blended, little bit tougher on the enterprise side. But on the other hand the governmental business and the small and medium have a good growth for us. So I think we see a very good possibility to continue to see that with the accelerates, sort of, the decline in enterprise. We have great funnel in the enterprise business as well. I remember I mean there's no impact of the reorganization we have done. I mean I would go the opposite. I will say that, hey the changes we have done in the last 12 months compared to what we've done in the last five to 10 years and we delivered these results in all the units, I think it's a really strength of the company that we are doing a transformation from a positional strength and then, which will set us up to be even stronger going forward. And, of course, Tam and our team are working daily with our customers and as I said also in my previously, I mean the excitement from -- enterprise customers when we come with the full portfolio, so be it fiber or if it's coming with the 4G or 5G solution, mobile edge compute. I think we have a good and compelling story to continue to work on there. So that's how I see the business. Then of course we still have some legacy business declining in the enterprise side which we'll have for a couple of quarters right now. Our work is to see that accelerated all the time. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So David, on the ETR, so as I look at that, remind you that on a year-over-year basis the adjusted ETR is actually is up as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and largely that's because of the onetime impacts a year ago from the adoption of the tax reform. So we do see that continuing to be higher year-over-year. But despite that the EPS in the quarter was up $0.03 even with some headwind from the ETR on a year-over-year basis and also approximately $0.04 of headwind from the accounting standard. So kind of similar to the first quarter, so good EPS performance year-over-year in both first quarter and second quarter, strong momentum there for us. We jumped off into the second half of the year and so I feel good about where we are so far this year and we'll see how the back end plays out, but certainly a very strong platform to be building from. \nDavid Barden: Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, David. Hey, Brett, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Two questions, first on the 5G Home. Hans how should we think about the expansion of the 5G Home footprint once you get the standards-based equipment? And anything you could tell us on sort of growth in the target market or higher expected subscriber base to grow out? And then second base -- the second question is on spectrum. Obviously you guys control less spectrum then your current competitors and with a T-Mobile Sprint deal, we're looking at coming with over 300 megahertz of spectrum. Is that a competitive disadvantage for you at this point? And would that situation worsen with a competitor out there with that much spectrum certainly relative to its smaller subscriber base? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. On the 5G Home, I think -- remember we have the limited sort of 5G Home in four markets right now and we capped both the development on our software as well on how many cities. That's how we did a proprietary solution. The only thing I can say, our win share is really good in those markets. It seems to be good appetite for 5G Home. We have a good performance of it. And then we're going for the second half of this year or this part of the year, we're going to come back with NR sort of 5G Home CP equipment. And I think that what we're going to do, we need a certain size of market that -- so it makes sense for us. So I think as we said before, I mean this is the 2021 when we're going to have a significant impact on our revenue. So 2020 is going to be an important year for us and of course coming out now in the latter part of this year and starting at the markets all the time will be very important. On the spectrum side, I mean, I think that we always have the headwind that people don't think we have enough spectrum and all of that. I mean what this organization and this engineering team is doing with the spectrum is, I would say is magnificent. Now remember sometimes when we talk about spectrum its so much more it is softer how you plan, how you build the network, how you get utilization out of it? And I think that -- that the team has done very good all the time. As I said previously, we have a very compelling position when it comes to millimeter wave for ultra wideband, but we also have spectrum where we can deploy 5G in the other bands ultimately 5G is going to be on all bands. And I have a high confidence that my team is going to be doing that well continue to have the leadership in the market when it comes to network performance. There might also come up opportunities all the time where it could be added spectrum. But right now to launch both capacity and coverage, we feel confident on the assets we have.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, John. Hey, Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you for taking the question. If I may, I just wanted to revisit on the fiber activity. I think you said you're now adding 1,400 miles of fiber -- route miles every month versus 1,000. Some tower companies have cited some issues with municipalities and power companies and utility. Are you finding that easier lately or harder? Because that just seems like a 40% increase monthly is a big jump.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you for the question. I would say this is not an easy work. This is really what Verizon is great at. I mean, we have people all the way from working with the municipalities, working with engineering, planning, working with third parties. And remember in the couple of years since we decided to invest together with warning in the fiber factory, we have come to actually around 1,400 route miles a month. So yes you're right, we are scaling right now and the team is really, really responding to the demands we have on them. We're always going to have even higher internal demands on them, but as you can see we definitely have a good role right now, but that doesn't mean that it's easy to do it. But I think we have put the machine in place with a team that I have lot of confidence into it.\nJennifer Fritzsche: And Hans if I may, should we continue to see that number increase throughout the year as you gain more scale?\nHans Vestberg: Not so much. I think we start to getting on the volumes we are and that's really important on the stand, because there has been questions on market, the CapEx will go up and all of that. Remember we are almost on the higher volume where we believe we need to be in order to serve this market, because there are of course technicalities of doing it. So I think we have a machine right now that is actually executing very well on the high volume. There might be some increases but maybe not so much more. I think now it's more about the broad deployment in all of these markets where we are right now deploying fiber.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Terrific. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Jennifer. Hey, Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi thanks. Couple of questions. First, has there been any recent changes to the cable MVNO deal? And how do you see your role continuing to evolve as a wholesaler of capacity in the industry? And then secondly is there an update on any of the potential strategic moves you could make on the wireline side, whether it's asset optimization or trying to figure out maybe how to proceed in the video business with the current size that you have? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. Thank you. On the MVNO side, no, there are no major differences but the important is that, we believe its good model. Remember we outlined our network-to-service strategy where we -- sometimes we're doing the connectivity and then we have others being on top of this in MVNO, sometimes we do the connectivity to platforms and in some cases we do the whole strategy. So I think that that continues to be important for us and we're happy with our partnership with the cable MVNO which is part of how we are actually doing a month usage of our assets, getting maximum utilization of the investments we're doing. So for us this is playing straight into the long-term goals as we have as a company. On the wireline optimization, we -- I would say that the biggest assets we have here is of course all the infrastructure we have, but also the customer relations we have and we are working. Of course we are looking into all the areas we need to fortify or all the areas we should drop which was the market is not demanding. And I think that's a very normal way of reviewing the strategy all the time. And Tammy and the team is now in place for this quarter, they are confident talking to the customer what we need to do and where we need to fortify in some areas where the products maybe around heating. But is no major, it is just the daily grinding that you do in order to optimize, how you work with your customers and how you optimize your capital and efficiency. And I can also add of course that, in this quarter we announced and that we're going to work with YouTube TV when it comes to the sort of the linear TV both for the Fios optionality as well as for the wireless customers. So again, working with the model that we outlined in February and just continue with that.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Mike. Hey, Brett, ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. Hans, I wonder, if we could go back to the spectrum question for a second. I understand that the longer term spectrum position for 5G, you have a lot of spectrum bands outside of millimeter wave. But there's been a lot of concern in the market of late that for the near term your coverage map may be more limited than your competitors, until you can start peeling away some of your LTE and 3G committed spectrum bands and dedicate them. Can you just talk about that issue? And how you think about the coverage layer of 5G over the next few years as you make the transition?\nHans Vestberg: No, that's a great question. I think first of all DSS which is Dynamic Spectrum Sharing is the same for all and that's a standard solution coming out in the market software. So I think that we're not disadvantage -- anyone if you want to deploy your coverage and I think that's how we are on. At the same time you also want to see that there's enough handsets things out in the market when you start turning on 5G, so you get because we want to do a transformative feeling of over 5Gs. We don't want to rebrand them and say it's 5G and you don't feel a difference. We already have the best 4G network and for us the customer is the most important. So you're right. I mean I see that we will have a coverage map whenever it's going to be needed for our customers and is going to be enough handsets in the market and not disadvantage for anything. So I think that historically we have had those feedbacks that we are not in the right position with spectrum etcetera. I come from the outside. I worked and saying what Verizon has done with spectrum and with new software\u2019s and with the optimizing, how you build the networks and I'm confident that we have a good path here. I'm not feeling that we're disadvantaged. I feel that we're executing right now, we're launching markets where others are doing other things. \nCraig Moffett: Is there any concern that even from a marketing messaging perspective though that your competitors will have more ink on the map so to speak early on in 5G even if the experience in 5G may not be all that much better than your 4G networks?\nHans Vestberg: Let's see how that turns out. Because again there\u2019s a lot of promises. I think that Verizon has had and I actually inherited a fantastic DNA in this company that we first do the things and then we start marketing it. And I think that's what we will continue to do. Other might have other strategy, so I'm not going into that contest about who is talking most right now. I'm working with a technology, myself weekly to see that we are doing this right for our customers and that's a consumer, it's an enterprise customer, it's a governmental customers, it\u2019s an IoT customers. We think it through and that\u2019s why we build the Intelligent Edge Network already and started two years ago. And I think that the significance of understanding, how important that is for the success of Verizon, I think has not really been understood yet. And we will just continue to execute on that. But there's going to be a lot of message in the market and you know it as well. Just be confident that our company, Verizon will continue to execute on the real 5G with eight currencies and seeing that we can actually give the right performance to all our customers in the right moment. \nCraig Moffett: Thanks, Hans.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Craig.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Hey, Brett, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Two questions if I may. First for Matt, I was hoping you could quantify the cost of the VSP plan that was implemented in the second quarter. Since that didn't seem to have an impact on free cash flow? And then secondly if you're able to just quantify the savings you could expect from that as we go into the third quarter? And then my second question has to do with the fiber out miles you're referencing on the call. I just wanted to separate the conversation between the route miles and small cells. So I appreciate your adding about 1,400 miles, route miles per month in the second quarter. But are you seeing the same momentum in terms of actually getting the small cells put up as well? Because I feel like you could still be adding the fiber route miles, but not necessarily getting the actual small cells up and seems like those two things would have to go hand-in-hand and that might explain why some of other companies that are out there doing the same thing might be seeing the lease on the small cell side? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the fiber and Matt will on start on the other one. So the fiber, remember it's a multiuse fiber and I have several different customers. I have the network guys that need this for 4G and 5G, I have the enterprise, I have the small and medium, and I have wholesale. And that's, of course, very important when we build that we can have owner economics on fiber and we can build it as we had all those customers. But, of course, initially quite a lot of the fiber is coming and going to the small cells and that's why we are able to turn up the 2019, as we have done so far. But again, the question earlier was about how much we are now actually gaining on it. I think this is an early indicator about how we're building the network, because you need to start with the fiber and getting the permits in the cities before you can deploy the 5G. So this is early indications that we have a high speed and organization to be prepared for the 5G. And whatever our use cases we have for fiber. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. So, Colby, on the voluntary separation, yeah, obviously, the income statement charges we took in the fourth quarter of last year from a cash flow standpoint, we took but the largest piece was in the first quarter and then some in 2Q and 3Q. Certainly I think that there's good savings in the first half of the year. We mentioned like $418 million of positive impact in the first half of the year and we'll have another step-up in 3Q as the final tranche of employees came off payroll at the end of June. So for the full year, I expect that to be north of $1 billion of impact and that benefit on a year-over-year basis will carry over into the first half of next year until we get to a full run rate by June of next year. So certainly being a positive thing is part of our overall focus on improvement the cost efficiency of the business and we will continue to focus on that. We're well on-track to more than meet the $10 billion commitment we made and the VSP was a big component of that.\nColby Synesael: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Colby. Hey, Brett, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nMike McCormack: Hey, thanks guys. Hans maybe just a quick comment on what you're seeing at robust subscriber estimate business segment for wireless. What you're seeing from a competitive standpoint in the B2B marketplace? I know one of your competitors is pretty loud about getting bigger there. And just thinking about the ARPA drivers going forward, what do you see there? Obviously you have more route to move to Unlimited. Any other puts and takes of ARPUs should be thinking about the back half? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. On the business side when it comes to wireless we are taking share. We feel really good about it. I think that Tam and the team are doing a great job with relationship that we had of course the network quality we have, it is very important for businesses. I mean there's no doubt about that coverage and capacity becomes even more important and there's no enterprise company there has not been a bigger to transformation. So I'm pleased with that we want to do even more. So yes. The second question was about the ARPA. I will hand it over to Matt. But I can also say that, a team with Ronan, especially on the consumer side has been since Unlimited would launch continue to lean forward with new offerings with new ways of dealing with the market segmenting and up and actually continue to have good service revenue role. And I think that's what I'm pleased with and I look at the team. I know that they have more call up the sleeves so they say. So what Matt and I are doing together we're transforming the company to have a decent term to closer that to be prepared for that marketplace to continue to do well. So I feel good about Ronan and what his team is doing. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Hans. So Mike as you think about wireless as a whole in your office trajectory, it's coming from the overall growth of the business. Just a few things to point out that's really driving both ARPA and obviously the total service revenue being the B2B space which have very strong results in the quarter, while the consumer space which also performed well. Net account growth positive in second quarter of this year, that's up year-over-year so a good growth there. We continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds yet again a number of quarters in a row that we've done that. And in addition to leading the industry in gross adds, growing year-over-year and not \u2013 that\u2019s something that not all industry participants can say that they did. So leading the industry in gross adds also leading the industry in phone churn, yet again. The net result there is phone net adds of 245,000 a nice increase over the 199,000 last year. So as I think about the business in the first half of the year, we had nice strong performance that went from the operational side on to the financials as well, puts us in a good great place as we jump off into the second half of the year to continue that momentum, and feel good about where we are at this point in time.\nMike McCormack: Great. Thanks, guys.\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. Thanks, Mike.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Hey, Brett, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Just a couple on wireless competition. So Hans, obviously, a strong wireless quarter. I'm curious if you're seeing any competitive impact from the first set initiative at AT&T. I know, I think you recently signed a deal with the Massachusetts first responder. I'm not sure if that\u2019s sign of competition going back and forth. And then I was just hoping to revisit, bundling and the importance of video to wireless with AT&T planning to bundle HBO Max when the launch it next spring with wireless services. Is bundling video with wireless, is it a lower churn, or is it just necessary to compete on the promotional basis with others that are offering video. I'm just sort of curious how that informs your video strategy? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. So you need to speak a little bit when we talk about the consumer and business. But let me just say, I mean if I look in the second quarter it was a little bit more competitive than the first quarter when it comes to competition in the market and that tells a lot about our performance that we gained all those net additions at the same time we had the low churn. And so I think that on the business side, as I said before, we are -- we're doing well on the business side and again I think that the wireless part of the business side is important than the network performance ease of critical essence, the coverage and the performance. But, of course, there's competition for those deals as well. I think we're doing well in that area and we will continue to do well. We have new offerings coming out and we'll continue to build the network even more robust and getting more quality on it. So again I think the team is there, Matt and I are working with transformation of the company to enable after continue to compete and do well in the market and even both Tami, I would say and Ronan are the sort of tools to work in the market. And that's what we're doing. And I think we're done it well in this quarter and preparing for the rest of the year.\nMatt Ellis: Just one follow-up on the video question there. Look we're very confident with \u2013 the most important thing to customers and wireless is the quality of the network experience. And so for the past couple of years now, we're seeing competitors bundled video offerings in with wireless and we continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds and we continue to lead the industry in churn. So I think that demonstrates the most important thing to customer is the quality of that connection, the reliability of that connection and that when you have the best network, you don't need to bundle other things in there in the same way and we'll continue to be focused on providing the best quality network out there.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Doug. Hey, Brett, that's all the time we have right now. Before we end the call, I'd like to hand it over to Hans for some closing comments.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. I think we've covered quite a lot of ground in this call, because basically question has range for all our business. But here's just a couple of things. First of all, I'm really proud of the team, what they\u2019ve achieved. And remember we have change the structure, we have changed how we build a network, we have done large voluntary program. We're reporting in a new structure, we're putting new structure and team is executing well. I think that's the way we want to work here, continue to lead the market and continue transform to be a strong company with a strategy we set out in February. So that then comes back to execution on fundamentals. That's what we're doing and will continue to do so to be disciplined on our capital, also continue to lead to market. And then of course I think a lot of questions are circulating around the 5G what we laid out in the February, Capital Markets Day is still valid and that's what we're aiming for and we are executing on and I think that the team is doing a great job there. So I think that to sum it up. I'm proud of the quarter and the changes that we're doing at the same time delivering this quarter so -- and financial earnings. So thank you very much for attending this call. And I guess I'll see you out there soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-23 15:21:13", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now, let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the first quarter of 2019, we reported earnings of $1.22 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results including net pretax benefit of $96 million related to a pension re-measurement triggered by the Voluntary Separation Program. The net impact after tax was a benefit of approximately $71 million or $0.02 per share resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. This represents growth of 2.6% on an adjusted basis compared to $1.17 a year ago. Let\u2019s now move to slide 4 and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the first quarter. As a reminder at the beginning of 2018, we adopted accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition, which results in a reduction in wireless service revenue, offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue and a deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. As we discussed previously, we expect a smaller benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of the standard, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction in benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to consolidated earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share. For the first quarter the impact was a $0.03 year-over-year headwind to earnings per share. This headwind is expected to continue until the end of 2020. In addition as of January 1, 2019 we adopted accounting standard ASC 842 for leases. This will primarily result in the gross up on the balance sheet for all operating leases. Upon adoption we recorded approximately $22.1 billion in operating lease obligations on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share, primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs. As highlighted on our last call, we expect this impact to result in a $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter, headwind on earnings per share through 2019. For the first quarter this headwind was $0.01 on earnings per share. As you look at slide 4, you can see that the 2.6% growth in adjusted EPS includes both the impacts from the deferral of commission expense related to the revenue recognition standard and the adoption of the leasing standard. This highlights the strong underlying performance of the business. Matt will take you through the details and key drivers later in the call. Before we do that, I'll turn the call over to Hans for his opening remarks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. And welcome everyone to the first earnings call in 5G mobility era. Once again, Verizon has led the world in the development of new technologies with the launch of our 5G ultra wideband mobility network and the Motorola 5G smartphone. We launched our first two cities Chicago and Minneapolis and continue to deploy infrastructure in more cities, prioritizing cities that have made it easy to build there. Our initial launches are performing as expected on a brand new technology being deployed for the first time in the world. As more features within a network enhances become available for deployment through ongoing software innovation, we will provide increased coverage, improved capacity and greater throughputs. For our 5G Home product, we\u2019re on track to launch additional markets when new customer equipment under the global standards becomes available in the second half of the year. These enable us to apply our learning\u2019s from the initial commercial launch in 2018 to a broader base of customers. I'm super proud of what Verizon team has achieved so far and I'm pushing our teams for many more milestones and industry first that will give our customers the best experience. 5G has been a huge focus for us, but it hasn't taken away from our ability to enhance and improve the best in class 4G LTE network and superior customer experience. The network team continues to deploy leading technologies that improve our customer\u2019s experience. We have 4G LTE Advanced capability in over 1500 markets across the U.S. and continue to be recognized by third parties for our superior network performance. Our One Fiber deployment is rapidly expanding the multipurpose fiber network outside our landline footprint. This will enable new revenue opportunities in the large enterprise, small businesses, public sector and the wholesale businesses, while also delivering expense reductions opportunities. We have ramped up installations to a run rate over 1,000 route miles per month, which puts us at the top of all major U.S. fiber providers. All of this is being accomplished within the current levels of our CapEx guidance. We are now two years into the implementation of our next generation Intelligent Edge Network, which we expect to be launched and completed by 2021. We're realizing significant deficiencies and cost savings from our network transformation initiatives and expect the CapEx and OpEx benefits to extend well beyond their investment target. With our unique set of assets including our wide portfolio of spectrum, dense fiber network architecture and software defined network capabilities; Verizon remains the clear network performance leader in today's marketplace, and we\u2019re best positioned to capitalize on all the opportunities that 5G will bring to bear. Our ambition remains to provide the most advanced next generation network performance in the world. As I have said many times before, the combination of our Intelligent Edge Network and the 5G technology capabilities will deliver eight network [currencies] [ph] to our customers and open up a new world of innovation that will transform the way we work, live and play. We\u2019re leading in the world in 5G, extending our leadership position in 4G, executing on the fundamentals and creating new ways to leverage our vast distribution capabilities through our network as a service strategy and focus our partnership and key elements in driving increased value for our customers. Therefore, we are excited to announce we partnered with Google to offer YouTube TV to our customers wherever they want it and on whatever platform they choose. Our new partnership allows our widest mobility customers to take their YouTube TV with them on-the-go. Our wireless 5G Home customers to add premium content from YouTube TV to their Internet bundle and gives our consumer Fios broadband customers even more options when it comes to content and services. 2019 is shaping up to be an exciting year for Verizon. We have started a year with a solid financial result for the first quarter, led by strong growth in wireless service revenue and earnings per share. We're confident in the current state of our business and have good momentum going into the second quarter. I'm proud of the team\u2019s flawless execution in times of so much change and transformation in the company. We have maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation, focused on investing in our networks, supporting a consistent dividend policy, and strengthening our balance sheet as shown by our recently announced leverage targets. We\u2019re well-positioned to deliver on all of our capital allocation goals in the years ahead. We\u2019re highly confident in our underlying business and go-to-market strategy as we now have moved to our new Verizon 2.0 structure as of 1st of April. The new structure positions us to better serve our customers and provide solution to their needs regardless of their underlying technology. We will begin reporting in the new structure starting with the second quarter results. With that said, I will now hand the call over to Matt to discuss our financial results.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Hans. And good morning, everyone. Let's jump in with a recap of our consolidated operating and financial results. On a reported basis, first quarter consolidated revenue was $32.1 billion, up 1.1%. The primary driver of the increase was strong wireless service revenue growth. We are maintaining our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth. On a consolidated basis, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%. This was up from 37.1% and includes the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense and the impact of the lease accounting standard that Brady mentioned earlier. The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to wireless service revenue performance, as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business. Our business excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash savings of $3.0 billion since the program started in 2018. At the end of the first quarter, we have completed the first two phases of our Voluntary Separation Program and have realized approximately $118 million of expense savings. Roughly 60% of the savings in the first quarter is attributed to the Wireline business with the remainder primarily in Wireless. We are on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was up over 100 basis points versus the prior year. Last year's ETR included certain onetime benefits due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will not repeat this year. Despite the higher tax rate, we delivered earnings growth with strong operational performance. Based on the strength of the operational trends in the underlying business, we are raising earnings guidance for full year 2019. We now expect low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. This is an increase from our prior guidance, which is a 2019 adjusted EPS to be similar to 2018 excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. Our expectations regarding the headwind impact on EPS from the new lease accounting standard remain unchanged at approximately $0.04 to $0.08 for full year 2019. As Hans said, we are moving to the new Verizon 2.0 structure in the second quarter reporting cycle. We plan to provide recast quarterly historical financial information for the past nine quarters, prior to reporting second quarter results, so our investors can digest the new view of our company well in advance of our second quarter earnings report. We are committed to providing transparency in our reporting in order to help bridge the transition to the new structure. Now let\u2019s move on to the reviews of the operating segments starting with Wireless on slide 7. Total Wireless operating revenue increased 3.7% to $22.7 billion in the first quarter, primarily driven by continued strong service revenue performance. We are extremely proud of our results given the level of promotional activity in the marketplace during the quarter. Wireless service revenue increased by 4.4% mainly due to customers stepping up into higher-priced plans, contribution from the strong net adds late in the fourth quarter and an increase in connections per account. The year-over-year growth rate was positively affected by a number of factors. In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the consumer migration from traditional subsidy to device payment plans and we moved to a longer device upgrade cycle for business customers. We anticipate that the impact of these two items will be minimal going forward and expect wireless service revenue growth to be within the mid 2% to 3% range for the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, equipment revenue decreased 2.2% driven by the continuing extension of device ownership cycles. Wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 47.4%. This includes headwinds of approximately 85 basis points, primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard as previously mentioned. Let\u2019s now turn to slide 8 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. Customer activity in the quarter was consistent with seasonal trends from prior years. We maintained measured promotional actions and our postpaid net adds totaled 61,000 consisting of total net losses of 44,000; tablet net losses of 156,000; and other connected device net additions of 261,000 led by wearables. Postpaid smartphone net additions were 174,000. Phone churn increased slightly during the first quarter due to the competitive nature of the marketplace. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.84% was up 4 basis points and remain strong. Our superior network quality and our personalized offerings continue to resonate with our customers. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.12% was up compared to 1.04% last year. Total postpaid device activations of which approximately 78% were phones were down 4.7%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4%, down from 5.0%. In the first quarter, prepaid net losses were 176,000 compared to a loss of 335,000 last year. We continue to focus on high-value accounts and profitability in our prepaid offerings. Now let\u2019s move to our Wireline segment on slide 9. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.9% in the quarter as the business continues to face secular pressures. Growth in high quality fiber products was more than offset by pricing pressures on legacy products and technology shifts. Consumer Markets revenue increased 0.1% driven by the growth in Fios services. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 2.9% due primarily to demand for our broadband offerings. Fios Internet net adds of 52,000 were driven by continued demand for our high-quality fiber broadband product. Fios Video losses of 53,000 resulting from continued cord-cutting trends as more customers are choosing over-the-top video services. Our enterprise solutions, partner solutions and business markets revenues declined by 4.5%, 12.5% and 4.9% respectively, driven by technology shifts and pricing pressures as mentioned earlier. Wireline segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 20.3% which included a meaningful contribution from our cost management initiatives, especially the Voluntary Separation Program. Let\u2019s now move on to slide 10 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the first quarter, Verizon Media Group revenue was $1.8 billion, which was down 7.2%. Declines in desktop advertising continue to more than offset growth in mobile and native advertising. The integration of the demand side and supply side platform is complete and the team is finishing the customer migration to the new consolidated platform. We continue to enhance the features and solutions, making it easier to do business with our advertising partners, enabling us to create even more synergies across the business. The Verizon Media Group team is focused on enhancing our super channels, driving revenue improvements in sports, finance, news, entertainment, home and mail by deepening our customer engagement. For example, during the quarter, Yahoo! Finance launched live bell-to-bell video coverage which is linked throughout the family of Yahoo! brands for optimal viewership. Let's now focus on consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on slide 11. Cash flow from operating activities was strong and totaled $7.1 billion, an increase of about $400 million from the prior year. This was driven by the continued momentum of our operating businesses and lower discretionary employee benefits contributions, partially offset by the first and largest of three payments related to our Voluntary Separation Program. Capital spending for the first quarter was $4.3 billion, which was down approximately $300 million. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in data room video traffic on our industry leading 4G LTE network. The launch in continued build out of our 5G ultra wideband network, the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint. We maintain our full year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first quarter of $2.8 billion, up about $700 million. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to execute on our strategy. We continue to maintain near term maturities at low levels, giving us the confidence to operate effectively in various financial market conditions. We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of total gross debt, which was comprised of $103.3 billion for unsecured debt and $10.4 billion of asset-backed securitizations. As part of our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet, we provided a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1.75 times to 2.0 times at our Investor Day in February. At the end of the first quarter, our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times, down from 2.4 times in the first quarter of 2018. Our progress in strengthening the balance sheet and the continued use of excess cash flow after investing in the business to further delever the balance sheet has been recognized by the rating agencies with both S&P and Moody\u2019s recently putting Verizon on positive outlook for a potential upgrade in credit ratings. With that, I'll turn the call back to Hans for a summary of our strategic positioning and goals for the remainder of 2019.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Matt. As demonstrated by our strong results, we have carried forward the momentum that we saw into 2018 through the first quarter of 2019 and our focus and execution in Verizon 2.0. We\u2019re committed to creating great customer experiences as a result of the investments in our networks. We\u2019re extending our leadership position in 4G, driving innovation in 5G and expanding our high value customer relationships, while creating value for our shareholders. We\u2019re building momentum for our ultra wideband 5G network, our launch of the world's first commercial 5G smartphone signals the beginning of an era that would transform the way people live, work and play. Our strategy relates to foundation for the future through investments in our Intelligent Edge Network, enabling efficiencies throughout the core infrastructure and delivering flexibility to meet customer requirements at the network edge. We\u2019re excited about the current position in the marketplace, our financial strength and our opportunities ahead of us. With that, I will turn the call back to Brady so we can get to your questions.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Actually sort of two related questions here on mobile 5G. At your analyst meeting, you identified a key opportunity with your mobile 5G launches defending and growing your market share. And so, it was actually interesting to see that the first mobile offer was actually priced a little bit higher than your 4G offering and so that implies it's a little bit more of an ARPU driver. So the first question is, as we sort of watch more 5G deployments going forward, what's success factor do you think investor should be focusing on? Is it going to be subscriber metrics responding favorably or ARPU/ARPA metrics responding favorably? And then just the second part of this and this is something Hans alluded to earlier, which is that some of the initial reviews of the launch have noted that this is still an early-stage technology. And so the question is, you know, when should investors expect some of the technical adjustments to be ironed out so that you can scale your mobile 5G offering in a way that will deliver a more consistent user experience? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. And if we start with the mobile 5G, as we said before, we see of course an opportunity when you\u2019re early on a customer experience like 5G, you have a chance and we have high ambitions here to see that we can grow with subscribers. But again, we\u2019re very early stage on 5G. I mean, we are absolutely the first in the world. At the same time, of course, we will see that we have an offering that responds to the enhanced, sort of technology and experience you will get from 5G. So that's what you saw on the first commercial offerings we did on the 5G moto. We will soon, as well announced earlier, come with our next phone and that we're going to discuss or announce how we're going to deal with that. But, clearly, the team has high ambition in this area. We think that our leadership and experience is giving us a way to monetize 5G for mobility. When it comes to the initial launch on the mobility in Minneapolis and Chicago, it meets our expectation what we have seen from the software. Remember, this - we are first in the world to adjust from all the way from the network to the chipset, to the handset and actually have an experience and we have a great experience out there, already right now in the Moto Mod. Basically constantly updates on the software, improving the throughput, the speeds and all of that and features. And, of course, we\u2019re part of driving the improvements on 5G in the world and giving our customers the first experience. So I would say that I'm really excited on what I've seen so far. It's meeting our expectations, but we have much more to come out from when it comes to speed, throughput, coverage and all of that from the deployment on our Ultra Wideband 5G. And then, not forgetting that we also as well said so many times before, when we launched 4G, we didn't even know we're about carrier aggregation, which of course changed the whole game on 4G LTE Advanced, which we now enjoy more than 1500 markets on that, and that will happen with the 5G as well. And one of the most important features that I have talked about is of course the dynamic spectrum sharing that will come during next year, where you basically also can use, deploy wherever you are with 5G and then you don't need to allocate certain spectrum to certain technology. So I see a lot of technology innovation and we work with most advanced partners in the world here to actually stay in the lead.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Hans and one for Matt. Hans, can you give us any early learnings you have on the - of the 5G home deployment? And I realized you\u2019re working with pre-standards equipment and expect that equipment to be available later this year. Can you talk about the benefits that you'll see may be in terms of capabilities, installation and form factor, when you get that new standards-based equipment? And then maybe one for Matt. On the wireless side, it looked like the cost of service was a bit elevated this quarter and then have impact on margins. Is that all being driven by the lease accounting or was there something underlying operational issues that's driving that? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: If I thought and as you rightly pointed out, the first deployment of 5G Home that we did last year was based on our own proprietary standard and thus it was a limited [scope] [ph] and no development on the software. However, what we have seen is consistent speed keeping up 300 megabits per second minimum to our customers, which is great to see. Second, of course, the installation times has been reduced significantly since the beginning. So we have a great lot of learnings when we come out in the second half of this year when we have CPs on the global standard for 5G Home. And again it's sort of a multi-deployment, so it's the same equipment doing mobility in Home so with all improvements we're going to see on 5G mobility, it's going to go to 5G Home as well with the software. So a lot of great learnings, especially on the coverage, installation times and then keeping the consistent on the speeds, which has been very good.\nMatt Ellis: Good morning, John. So on your question around wireless margins so we reported 47.4%. But as you touched in on your question there was some year-over-year noise from the accounting both the deferred commission expense coming from revenue recognition and the lease accounting about 85 basis points on there, so that's showing up in both the cost of sales and SG&A lines. But when you - so when you adjust for that the 47.4% gets you to about 48.3% so up year-over-year, 47.8% a year ago so nice improvement on the margin year-over-year, which when combined with the 4.4% service revenue growth means that we think we had a very good earnings quarter in wireless, high quality of earnings there and really setting the basis for the year as a whole.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad - thanks, John. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, guys thanks for the follow-up and a question. First, Hans, can you give us an update on the 5G equipment pipeline and the potential timing for - and our volumes as well as the impact to CapEx pace? And then second with leverage now in the low 2s, can you talk about strategic priorities beyond the current business? Can you envision making a strategic acquisition this year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: So first of all, when it comes to the ecosystem of handsets et cetera, I think that as was alluded during our Investor Day, we see a majority of the handsets coming out next year having the millimeter wave spectrum. Many of the phones as I've already talked about, meaning the Samsung phone both the Note and the Galaxy coming this year will both have it 5G. We have the Moto already. We're going to see also LG phone coming out. So we see a much quicker ramp on ecosystem in that area to be clear. At the same time, the whole ecosystem from chipsets to equipment is ramping up quickly. But again, we are in the forefront of technology here, so of course we are being on the edge of the demands and the supply on equipment at the moment, but we feel good about that. Secondly, the question around our capital allocation. We remain very solid in what we have said before. Number one, we invest in our business, number two, we see that we can serve the dividend our shareholders, and thirdly, then we have our targets that Matt talked about on the balance sheet. That's really where we have the main focus. Then we talked at the Investor Day, there could be tuck-ins et cetera, but nothing else in that at the moment.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Matt. maybe you could just talk about the wireless service revenue, the ARPA was strong this quarter, I think you mentioned people moving to higher priced plans. So where are you on unlimited adoption and the spread across those plans? And how much headroom do you have on that? And then perhaps on the network, can you just talk about the refarming of the 3G spectrum and where you are in that process, particularly in the major markets? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. Good morning, Simon. So as you look at the wireless service revenue, as you see the 4.4% was - was a good result in the first quarter. As we look at that the ARPA was a big piece of it. We continue to step customers up to unlimited, which is typically a step-up in our ARPA. We continue to add connections per account, and we think we still have the runway to do so. Unlimited is still less than 50% of our - of our total connections. So there is - there is runway there to continue that, and that's why you heard us make the comment on the prepared remarks that we see, service revenue for the balance of the year continuing to be in the mid twos [ph] to 3% range. So continued growth on a year-over-year basis, as we look forward.\nHans Vestberg: On the spectrum, I think that first of all, the team has continued to do excellent. As I said, we still are gaining the majority of all the performance metrics in the market, so the team is doing good work. And when it comes to the refarming of the 3G spectrum, we have said that's going to be ended by 2020, and we're on plan for doing that and the team is working everyday to see that we're doing that most out of our spectrum.\nSimon Flannery: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next call. Operator Thank you. The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. Maybe two if I could. Just Matt the - on the, sorry, the cost structure for the - the income statement on the dividend side, sorry, the depreciation side, we saw a step down of about $100 million there into the new year, with the big step up in kind of CapEx in the quarter. So if you could kind of address how depreciation is changing and contributing to the guidance? And then the second piece was just on the media side and I guess, corporate and other. If we look at the combined number that we back into by comparing the segments to the consolidated total, it looks like we had a step-up in losses there. Could you kind of talk about the profitability in that unit or if there are other things that are moving around in the corporate side, not related to the - to the media business? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. So thanks, David. So on the depreciation and amortization side, couple of things in there. One, you've obviously got the impact of the lease accounting standards, so some items that would have flown through D&A, will now flow through above the line and so that's part of it. The other piece is - is the mix of our spend over the last year or so has moved to a mix of assets with the longer average life, it means, they are depreciated over a longer time period. So that kind of impacts the timing of how they come through on the - on the depreciation line of the income statement. On the - the C&O side, as you look at that number, you're right that there is a little uptick in the - in the negative results in that piece and where that's coming from, there is - there is two or three one-timers in the first quarter. They weren't large enough for us to adjust out, but net-net, they had about a $0.02 impact at the EBITDA line. So you see that flowing through there that one-timers. We - you shouldn't expect to see them through the rest of the year. And so, you got strength in the overall results of the business in the Wireless and Wireline segments being offset by those - those one-timers that I'll say add up to about $0.02 of EPS pressure that's sitting in C&O. So it's related to one-timers rather than Verizon Media Group is driving that number in C&O.\nDavid Barden: Okay, great. That\u2019s enough. Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. I wonder if you could just comment on that - what you've learned about high frequency spectrum, the work that we did on the Sacramento market and then some of the - the press reports of your roll out of mobility in Chicago, in particular and then - and what some of the comments are - were yesterday from T-Mobile's, Neville Ray all sort of point at - at millimeter wave having real challenges for propagation. I'm wondering how you think about millimeter wave in the context of your broader roll out at this point of 5G particularly for mobility? And - and what role you think mid-band needs to play in that roll out?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. So when it comes to the millimeter wave, as I said before, I mean, that has lived up to our expectation on performance. And again, we're very early on in - in improving the software, how we can deal with it. We will need to remind ourselves, this is not the coverage spectrum because we will do it as far as the economic is sustainable, of course. But still, it's - it's very good ranges we can come up with and of course, the throughput and speeds are enormous. And again, we're very early on - on the - on the journey. I think that no one else in the whole industry knows more than Verizon about it. We're being onto these for two years and what we have seen on it, he said, it's a - it's a good strategy. And topping that, which I've said before the dynamics sort of spectrum sharing will be the next step for us to see that we have all the assets to deploy our strategy on 5G to meet the different type of use cases, we outlined at the Investor Day sort of the mobility case, the 5G home case and the mobile edge compute case. So that's what we're working with everyday here to improve et cetera. So the engineering team feels good about it.\nCraig Moffett: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Craig. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, thanks and good morning. Just two if I could. First, if you look at the 5G roll out for the home, I think initially your advertising to offer over several hundred megabits per second of speed to the consumer and more recently, we've learned that you've been trailing in over 100 megabit product. And I'm curious how that change in throughput affects the potential coverage in homes over time or the speed that you might be able to reach that initial 30 million home targeted that would accelerate that the pace of the roll out? And then just following up on the comments around the partnership with YouTube TV, what are your thoughts on potentially exiting the Fios video business and letting someone like a YouTube TV or another partner, just potentially manage that video business for you, so you could just really focus on the broadband and the infrastructure side of the equation? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks. Okay. Rightfully mentioned, we started with the 300 megabits per second in our - in our offering in the cities. Of course, we have said that we will sort of meet all the customer demands and that's why we are of course, are trailing out different type of speeds as well. And as you rightfully said, I mean, if you have a lower speed and throughput of course, the range of coverage will go out and go further. But again, we need to meet the customer demands in the markets, we're going to and - and the team with Ronan Dunne will see that we are competitive in every marketplace we go. But of course, you can see possibilities, we'll have different ranges of speeds on 5G home as well, but we're not there yet. We will come in the second half of the - this year and see what offerings going to have. On the YouTube TV, I think that what most important is that we are committed to support our customers with the optionality. Here we are creating, as we said from the beginning when we decided not to pursue our own investment in OTT that we will have partners in order to work out our strategy, networking [ph] strategy and give our customers optionality and that goes also for our Fios customers, and their You Tube TV will play a - play a role for us.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next question. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the question. Just two if I could. One on wireless, I think you called out some pleasantness with the churn levels given the promotional activity in the quarter. So maybe if you could talk about what you saw in the quarter? How that compared relative to expectations and typical 1Q seasonality? And then secondly, just to go back to the question on YouTube, what's exactly changing on the mobility side. Is just - is it just an ability for your mobile customers to watch YouTube on their phones or is there any sort of incentivization on the mobile side using YouTube as well? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Matt. So on the wireless churn, we saw what we would normally expect from a volume standpoint in 1Q with the typical drop off from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We saw fair amount of competitive activity in the first quarter, and we really didn't participate in that until we got into the March time period when we start to see volumes pick up. We feel good about the momentum we have in the business, as we exited the first quarter, as we come into second quarter and expect to see that drive performance for the rest of the year. On the YouTube TV, I think is as you described and you heard Hans gives us the opportunity to combine that product with the core wireless offering and Ron and his team will - will make sure that's relevant to our wireless mobility customers having that additional functionality available to them.\nMatthew Niknam: Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks Matt. Brad, we're ready for the next question. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Two questions if I may for - for Matt. The first one is on EPS guidance increase. Just curious how much of that you're anticipating coming from the operational businesses, so say differently, you're showing up in the EBITDA line item versus improvements that you're expecting below the line such as interest expense, taxes or other income I saw, for example, other income was $295 million or about $0.06 benefit in the first quarter at least that we weren't anticipating in our model. And then secondly, as it relates to the savings from the VSP program, you mentioned the $180 million to date and you mentioned $180 million to-date, and you've - I'm just curious, how much of that or how much more can we expect for the remainder of the year. And I guess, as part of that where can wireline margins go for this year, would you anticipate them continuing to go higher? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. Thanks, Colby. So I'll start with your second question. So as you think about the VSP savings in the first quarter, we said approximately 10,000 V Teamers, who are leaving the organization, as a whole around half of those came off at the end of December. So you had a full quarter impact from those. The second tranche was at the end of - end of March. So really minimal impact from those. So as you think, when you get to a full run rate, it's going to be significantly higher than that $180 million. 2Q will be a blend. It will be more than the 5,000, but not the full 10,000. It really be 3Q when you get to a full run rate benefit compared to the $180 million that we saw in 1Q. And as you say, more than approximately 60% of that benefit came from the - in the Wireline segment. And so we expect to see that continue to help wireline margins for the year, as a whole. So we think that - that will be something that will be a positive, as you think about managing the - the cost in that business to offset some of the trends on the revenue line. In terms of the EPS guidance, so I want to just make sure that we level set, where were - where we were. We wanted to make sure we kept it in the same basis as last time. Last time, we said that the adjusted EPS before the impact of the leasing standard would be similar to last year, last year is $4.71. And so we said adjusting the guidance to be low-single digits up. And to be clear, even after accounting for the new leasing standard that would put us in the - in the mid-$4.70s from an adjusted EPS standpoint. And when you think about what's in there, you got the headwind from the - the lease accounting standard, you've also got the impact of the commission expense deferral under the revenue recognition, and our expectation of those impacts are the same, as we outlined previously. So well, we certainly think and Brady took you through this in the prepared remarks, when you look to the first quarter results, we're up $0.03 year-over-year all in, from an adjusted EPS standpoint, that included $0.04 of pressure from the accounting. And in addition to that the ETR year-over-year was up about 100 basis points. So that year-over-year increase in the underlying earnings of the business was strong. And you touched on one piece that's certainly the benefit of the Voluntary Separation Program was helpful in there. But when you look at the Wireless business and you see the 4.4% service revenue growth, and you see the - EBITDA margin, when you adjust for the impact of the accounting for 48%, we feel very strong about the operational performance of the business on a good growth, on a year-over-year basis, and we have good momentum coming out of the first quarter, and as we head into the rest of the year. So that was the - the reason for the - the change in guidance.\nColby Synesael: Thank you, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Okay. Brad. We\u2019ve got time for two more questions, please. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nMike McCormack: Hey guys, thanks. Matt maybe a -- just a quick comment on the wireline revenue side, how much of I think we saw from an FX perspective headwind? And then maybe if you can try to bifurcate between the competitive landscape versus technology migration? And then, I guess I'll beat the YouTube TV one more time, just sort of thinking about and maybe this is for Hans. As you think about the synthetic double play economics for consumers, it doesn't appear at least on paper, but I'm seeing that there's a significant discount you're offering and maybe we haven't seen everything yet, but sort of like the rack rate of $50 a month for YouTube TV plus a naked [ph] broadband or stand-alone broadband product. How do you think about those economics and how competitive will that be against current double play offers? And I guess also the risk of cannibalization of the current Fios TV customer base? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Mike. So on your question around the wireline revenue, there was a little bit of headwind from the FX, primarily in the enterprise space, but it didn't offset the ongoing pressures that we see from the technology shifts. So we would expect some of those -- those trends to continue, as we go through the quarter. We certainly expect the Partner Solutions revenue trend to improve versus the number we saw in 1Q, but still be negative on a year-over-year basis. But we are continuing to expand the offerings that we have across the wireline business based of fiber based products and newer technologies. Those are continuing to grow, as we go forward and offsetting the decline in legacy products. And in addition to that wireline revenue has opportunities, as a result of fiber build. We're able to offer our services to small, medium business, to enterprise, to even on a wholesale partner basis in geographies that we historically haven't. So that will bring some incremental revenue opportunities to -- to our wireline customer base in addition to what we're doing with new products, as we move forward.\nHans Vestberg: When it comes to the YouTube TV and what we offered in our initial 5G home launch that was sort of a stand-alone offering. This is what we're doing right now. We are doing an overall agreement with YouTube TV to be offered to our home and mobility and Fios customers and final commercials, we have not decided yet. But clearly, we will - we will do it - compared to the offering for our customers, but we're also creating the optionality for our customers to get YouTube TV. And again, it comes back to our main strategy that we are focusing on doing the network, we're doing the platform, and we are doing the integration, but we're not taking sort of the investments of - of TV platform nor for the content. We see that is our role in this - in this ecosystem. And remember we have the best distribution, the best network and a great brand and that's what [ph] we can expect partnership like with YouTube TV. So that's a little bit different thinking.\nMike McCormack: Great. Thank you, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, okay. Brad, we've got time for one more question. Operator Thank you. Your last question will come from Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Your line is open.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Two questions. First, I want to go back to -- to Craig's question. Hans, you mentioned that millimeter wave not your coverage spectrum, I think that's a little different than - than what you guys have talked about before, so maybe we can talk about that dynamic spectrum sharing. Can you talk specifically about what - when next year that would be available? Which -- which spectrum bands you'll be putting the 5G and are on in order to enable that for coverage? And then, Craig - on the - going back to Hodulik's question on the expenses because I kind of got lost with all those numbers. I'm not sure, what you're referring to on the 42%, 47%. If we just look at network expense and SG&A, as your aggregate OpEx for wireless, it's up 10% year-on-year, how much of that is - has to do with this commission accounting and is this the kind of run rate, particularly on the SG&A side that we should expect going forward each quarter or was there some kind of one-time impacts on just the overall level of this OpEx particularly in SG&A? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: If I - if I start with the first question there that I don't think we've changed any thing about what we thought about millimeter wave, how we're going to deploy that and we're deploying massively at the moment. Remember, the majority of all the traffic is in dense urban areas, where we are now initially are focusing of course, getting -- an even greater experience for our customers and 5G experience, the real 5G experience. At the same time, we get the owners economics of having the best spectrum position there. When it comes to dynamic spectrum sharing and which spectrum, we're going to use et cetera and when will come into play? It will come into play next year. Right now, we're in discussion, but of course it's going to be whatever low band you want to have, mid-band and high band that's how it works. But all the time, all the spectrum will be sort of exposed to dynamic spectrum sharing. The good thing is for being a leader like Verizon, we can impact on own ecosystem, how this will be done and that's why we're in discussions with the chip set manufacturer and equipment manufacturers to have the best solution and again using the engineering skills of -- of the Verizon team.\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. So, Walt, on the wireless margin, the reported number was 47.4% as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. There was 85 basis points of pressure from the combination of the two new accounting standards, but the vast majority of that pressure came from the deferred commission expense. So as you think about the language we've used over the past few quarters related to the revenue recognition standard, you had the benefit last year. And then we said, you'd have year-over-year headwinds in both \u201819 and \u201820 until you get to a run rate on the amortization of those commission expenses being close to the actual cash expense upfront. So about 85 points of pressure, a lot of that\u2019s showing up in the SG&A line, as you point out, and that will continue throughout the year to varying degree. In addition to that, we did have a little bit of change in shaping of the advertising spending in wireless over the course of the year, a little more in 1Q this year than last year. I expect that will equal itself out over the course of the year as a whole. But the big impact was the impact of the deferred commission expense, so that's why we called out the 85 basis points so that you can get to 48.3% from the 47.4% and compare that year-over-year. And you see that wireless margins on a like-for-like basis actually grew year-over-year on an increase in revenue, so we think very strong quality of earnings within wireless in first quarter.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. I think the confusion is I think a lot of people look at margin on a service revenue as kind of a more appropriate way to look at margins, which appear to be down. So total revenue with equipment is - I mean, is your operating margins really have anything to do with equipment?\nMatt Ellis: Not significant, but that's why we put the -- make sure the 85 basis points was in the commentary, so that we give people a little more transparency and do the comparison year-over-year. So hopefully that helps.\nWalter Piecyk: Great. Thank you very much.\nBrady Connor: Okay, thanks. That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Hans for some closing comments.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Brady and thanks Matt. Just to sum up, I mean, the 5G era is here and we are positioning the company for long-term growth by taking advantage of the full array opportunities it has to offer. I think, during the first quarter, again, we delivered solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We remain confident in our strategy and prioritized led by building the best network, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model, and creating value for our customers and shareholders. By that, I would like to thank you all for attending this call today and have a great day.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}], "2021": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-01-26 15:01:15", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder we were in the quite period for spectrum auction 107. So we will not be able to comment on our midband spectrum holdings or strategy at this time. Now let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $4.30 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $523 million. This includes a net charge of $404 million primarily related to severance, including voluntary separations under our existing plans and the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities as well as a net loss of $119 million primarily related to the disposition of the HuffPost business. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.21 in the fourth quarter and $4.90 for the full year. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our fourth quarter earnings profile. The impact to earnings from the adoption of Accounting Standards ASC 606 for revenue recognition is illustrated for comparability purposes and reflects a reduction in the benefit realized due to the deferral of commission expense versus the prior year. We also continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of COVID on our business. The year-over-year impacts of both ASC 606 and COVID were not significant in the fourth quarter. The full year 2020 impacts from ASC 606 and COVID were $0.09 and $0.21 respectively on both a reported and adjusted earnings per share basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASC 606 to have a significant impact on the comparability of 2021 results to 2020. Full year adjusted EPS growth of 1.9% illustrate on the earnings waterfall slide reflects the strong underlying performance of the business. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans to take you through a recap of 2020.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and Happy New Year to all of you. First of all, 2020 was a challenging year and I can only say that I\u2019m super proud how Verizon responded to the changing environment during 2020. And we supported our customers, our employees and society in a way that I\u2019ve never seen before. So, all in all, a great year. At the same time, we executed well on our strategy and so that we had really good financial performance as well. When it comes to our 2020 strategic priorities, let me walk through the execution of them. First of all, strengthening and grow the core business, I\u2019m really proud to announce that we continue to have the best network in the nation. We just got for the 15th time the overall best network with RootMetrics on all seven different categories. That includes 5G, which is so important to us that we continue to have that lead. I'm also happy to announce that we won for the 26th consecutive time the J.D. Power\u2019s award. It tells a lot about our network and technology team, how they have been building a network and how we continue to lead this market. When it comes to the customer innovation, you have seen us working with our customers to give them richer offering, and also even better performance on the network. This year with Disney+, Discovery+, also adding in the iPhone 5 from Apple has, of course, supported a lot of innovation that we're doing in the Verizon Consumer Group. And we see a great migration of our customers to unlimited and to the premium unlimited. Finally, you can see also that Verizon Business Group has a year on investments to see that we are putting a foundation to be much stronger for the future had good growth in the wireless, and also in some areas like the public sector, very good performance and also adding local new customers on the enterprise side. When it comes to us leveraging the assets to drive new growth, the commitments we did in February 2020 when it comes to 5G were all met or exceeded. I'm extremely happy with that. We now have 64 Ultra Wideband cities. We are more than 10 cities on our home 5G Ultra Wideband, we have 10 Mobile Edge Compute centers public with Amazon. All in all, we deployed more than 5x more Ultra Wideband sites during 2020. And we launched the nationwide 5G that now is covering 230 million POPs in 2,700 cities. On the financial side, a strong year ended where we had more than 2% growth in the wireless service revenue. We also have growth on our EPS in the fourth quarter, over 7%. We had an operational cash flow full year of $41.8 billion, which is a growth of 17%. A very strong year that put us in a good position while going into 2021. And finally, we\u2019ve a really large focus on how to include all our four stakeholders in the work we are doing. And I\u2019m really proud of the Citizen Verizon that we launched during last year, which is a great way for us to see that the society aspect is part of our strategy, where, of course, our focus on being carbon neutral is very important; and the second green bond was launched at the second half of 2020. So, all in all, I\u2019ve to say, it was a very different year, but a great execution where we hit all our strategic milestones at the same time as we pivot and supported all our stakeholders. At the November sell-side event, I presented the five vectors of growth. Those are the vectors that is based on our strategy of Network-as-a-Service. Those are also the enablers for us to get to GDP plus. We have great traction on them, and we also have done quite a lot in 2020, all the way from the 5G adoption to the customer differentiation that I talked a lot about, the new markets that we are addressing still pending the acquisition of TracFone, but we have other segments we are addressing, as well as the next-generation business-to-business application based on our unique Mobile Edge Compute offering that we have with Amazon, also now with Microsoft and many other partners. And finally, the network monetization with our MVNO partners, which are enjoying the best network that we have and we are building. All in all, this is built on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that we outlined some 3 years ago and giving us the opportunity to have great execution in the future. With that, I would like to hand over to Matt to go through the financials in a little bit more detail.\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by saying how proud I\u2019m with the Verizon team and the results we delivered in 2020. In the fourth quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $34.7 billion, down 0.2%. Total wireless service revenue growth and strong results in Verizon Media Group were offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and ongoing declines in legacy wireline products. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.7 billion as compared to $11.1 billion last year, a 5.3% increase driven by service and other revenue growth and disciplined spending.  Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $47.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year, including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. Our continued focus on our Business Excellence program has resulted in realized cumulative cash savings of $9.5 billion, and we are well positioned to achieve our $10 billion goal ahead of our year-end 2021 target. COVID has brought about new ways of working, and we believe some of these will be long-term in nature. This will create additional savings opportunities beyond the current program. As Brady mentioned, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.21, up 7.1% from $1.13 a year ago. We are pleased to report 1.9% growth of full year adjusted EPS at the high end of our revised guidance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. Let\u2019s now turn to cash flow results on Slide 8. Our cash generation was exceptionally strong in 2020, reflecting our subscription-based business model and the quality of our customer base. This enabled us to continue to execute on our capital allocation model, investing in our business, increasing our dividend for the 14th straight year and strengthening our balance sheet. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $41.8 billion for the year, an increase of $6 billion from the prior year, driven by continued performance and strength in the business, lower tax payments due to a one-time cash tax benefit received earlier in the year and reductions in working capital primarily due to lower wireless volumes. Capital spending in 2020 totaled $18.2 billion, as we continued to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network and launching our nationwide 5G network. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $23.6 billion, up 32.4% year-over-year. Throughout the year, we opportunistically diversified our debt portfolio, optimized our cost of borrowing and retained a higher level of cash as a result of the pandemic. We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.3 billion, and our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.0x versus our targeted range of 1.75x to 2.0x. We remain committed to our capital allocation model. Now let\u2019s review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 9. Our competitive position is based on compelling unlimited plans that provide choice to consumers, paired with the best devices and attractive promotions, all built on the country\u2019s best network. This quarter, we launched our nationwide 5G service to coincide with the release of the iPhone 12 line up, which fully supports our Ultra Wideband offering, enabling Verizon customers to utilize a full range of connectivity provided by this iconic device. Partnerships remain a critical component of our value proposition. We recently added Discovery to our list of existing successful partnerships, which includes Apple and Disney. As the early cohort of Disney+ customers have come off of the initial free 12-month period, more than two-thirds have maintained their subscription, either through their Verizon Direct billing relationship or by opting into one of our newest Mix & Match plans with the Disney bundle included. Volume activity in the quarter was tempered by consumer behavior, given rising COVID cases and elevated store closures that limited foot traffic in addition to the retention offers in the market. As a result, the pool of consumers switching carriers was lower than a year ago. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were down approximately 24% year-over-year, relatively consistent with declines experienced in the third quarter. We are pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting, as over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan, and over 55% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter end, over 60% of our base was on an unlimited plan with more than 20% of our base taking a premium plan. Our customer retention remains high with phone churn of 0.76% for the quarter, down 7 basis points from a year ago, contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 163,000. Disconnects related to customers in our Stay Connected program totaled more than 135,000 phones in the quarter. Our Stay Connected program continued to see great results with approximately 95% of customers making a payment since entering the program, and collection cure rates are in line with our expectations. More than 50% of all customers in the program are current on their payments. December was the final month of service billings for the program, and payment activity remained stable, though we will continue to closely monitor payment trends in 2021. Turning to Fios. We continue to build on our strong third quarter with consumer Fios Internet net additions of 92,000, more than double the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Fios Internet net additions of 95,000 was the best fourth quarter we have had since 2014 and reflected strong demand for our gigabit offering as consumers continue to work and learn from home. Cost cutting trends continued, resulting in consumer Fios Video net losses for the quarter of 72,000. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $23.9 billion, down 1.2%. This was primarily driven by a 3.8% decline in wireless equipment revenue due to softer volumes in the quarter. For the full year, total Consumer revenue decreased 2.8% to $88.5 billion driven by the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter was $13.6 billion, a 1.2% increase. The results reflect the resilience of our business as we recovered from a 2.7% decrease in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ARPA growth of 1.8% year-over-year, even as TravelPass and other usage fees remain at subdued levels, demonstrating that our tiered approach to unlimited provides a strong foundation for delivering revenue growth. For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $53.6 billion, relatively flat from 2019 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.8 billion, a 2.5% decline from a year ago. Customer credits related to regional sports networks negatively impacted Fios revenue by 4.2% in the quarter and also reduced our content expense. We expect Fios revenue to benefit as growth in the broadband base offsets the impact of the shift from the triple-play bundle to stand-alone service. Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.9% to $9.9 billion. Margins were 41.5% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from last year, including headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. For the full year, EBITDA margins were 45.5%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year, including an impact of approximately 50 basis points from the deferral of commission expense. Now, let\u2019s move to our Business segment on Slide 11. Business wireless trends remained resilient throughout the year and the fourth quarter was no different. Public sector demand remained strong on the success of our distance learning program and support for increased needs of state and local government agencies. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, while we experienced modest pressures in enterprise. Business segment fund gross adds for the quarter were down 11% from the prior year due to store closures and continued economic weakness. Segment postpaid phone churn was 0.98% in the quarter, which was down 2 basis points over the prior year. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 116,000. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 12, to review the Business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment were $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down slightly year-over-year. Full year operating revenues of $31 billion, represented a decline of 1.5% from the prior year. Wireless service revenue in the quarter accelerated to 7.1% year-over-year from 4.9% in the third quarter, which was more than offset by reductions in wireless equipment volumes and secular pressure on legacy wireline products. Looking at wireless service revenue, public sector had a particularly strong quarter and small and medium business growth improved for the second straight quarter, although it was still below pre-pandemic growth rates. Legacy wireline product trends appear to be normalizing after initially benefiting from the transition to a work-from-home economy. The growth in advanced communication services continues to drive opportunities for the segment. While we are pleased with the revenue performance of the Business segment and exit 2020 with momentum, there are uncertainties around how businesses will perform in 2021 given the challenges within the macro environment. The elevated demand experienced in public sector and parts of enterprise throughout 2020 could potentially create headwinds to growth in the Business segment, particularly in the back half of 2021. Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the strength in wireless service revenue and the benefits of our transformation initiatives, including back office digitalization and optimization. Full year margins of 25.4% were up slightly versus last year. Now let\u2019s move on to Slide 13, to discuss Verizon Media Group. We are very pleased with Verizon Media Group performance. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up approximately 11% from a year ago, the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the Yahoo! acquisition. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends with demand-side platform revenue growing 41% compared to the prior year. Advertising strength came from political, consumer products, technology and retail, among other verticals. The fourth quarter also saw continued high consumer engagement in commerce as offline to online shopping behaviors continued through the holiday season on our owned and operated properties. In particular, mail e-commerce revenue growth was 7x that of the prior year, and we saw continued strength in finance and news as daily active users grew 52% and 11%, respectively. Let\u2019s now move on to Slide 14 for a quick look at overall wireless performance. Key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segments are illustrated on this slide. Total wireless service revenue was up 2.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 0.7% for the full year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website. Now let\u2019s focus on our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We are excited to deliver 2021 expectations that include accelerating revenue and earnings growth driven by our five growth vectors as wireless service strengthens and 5G continues to scale. This year, we are providing an outlook for service and other revenue, which includes revenues from across all of our businesses, but excludes wireless equipment revenue given its variability, especially in the current environment. For 2021, we expect service and other revenue growth of at least 2%, reflecting an acceleration of total wireless service and Fios revenue growth as well as continued momentum in Verizon Media, partially offset by ongoing legacy wireline product declines. Included in this outlook is total wireless service revenue growth of at least 3% driven by our tiered unlimited plans, new customer contributions and ongoing strength in business. For the full year, we expect to see adjusted earnings per share of $5 to $5.15 driven by recurring service and other revenue growth as well as ongoing cost initiatives. We assume no significant year-over-year impact from below-the-line items based on the 2021 opening balance sheet. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. Our consolidated capital spend for full year 2021 is expected to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, consistent with the prior year and within our normal capital intensity range. Our focus for the year includes further expansion of our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in new and existing markets, densification of our network to manage future traffic demands and continued deployment of our fiber infrastructure. Our cash flows in 2021 are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by taxes and working capital. We anticipate that our cash taxes in 2021 will be higher than in 2020, given expectations for higher pre-tax income this year and a one-time $2.2 billion cash tax benefit received in the second quarter of 2020. Working capital was a tailwind in 2020 due to the lower equipment volumes, which we do not expect to repeat in 2021. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our 2021 priorities.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Let me review the 2021 priorities based on the four pillars of strategic priorities, starting with the core business. And as you heard Matt talking about accelerating the service revenue, I\u2019m pleased that we are guiding for a plus 3% wireless service revenue growth in 2021. That\u2019s based on that we will continue to differentiate our value proposition for customers. We also will continue to invest in our Verizon Business Group to capture that potential we see in the Business segment with a new platform that we are developing together with our customers. When it comes to our 5G and investing in our business, we have a big year in front of us in 2021. Again, we are going to almost double the amount of 5G Ultra Wideband sites. We are going to have 14,000 new sites coming in during 2021. That will enable us to continue to increase with plus 20 cities when it comes to 5G Ultra Wideband. And we are also going to add some plus 20 5G Home cities, at the same time, focusing very much on the 5G Mobile Edge Compute with 10 more sites when it comes to the public side. And then on the private side, we will scale that network together with the demand that has come as we know already, all underpinned with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and the fiber that we are deploying. When it comes to the financial, Matt talked about that we continue to focus on to accelerating the earnings per share growth, now with guidance of $5 to $5.15 earnings per share. The year 2020 solidified our balance sheet, and we will be continued focused on the cash flow generation. And finally, when it comes to our culture and our purpose, we have very much focused on the customer-centricity and the brand strength that we have built in the market. That will continue, as well as we will have also the Citizen Verizon totally included in the overall strategy. You see that we are managing all the four stakeholders that is making the success for Verizon in the future. So very clear, a year of execution. We have progressed one more year on the Verizon 2.0. We are in a great position. I\u2019m really excited to go into 2021. I\u2019m pleased to announce that we will have our normal Investor Day in the early part of 2021. We will come back with the exact date in due time. And by that, I would like to hand over to Brady for Q&A.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. We are -- Brad, we are now ready to take the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys, thanks. Two, if I can. First, Hans, can you talk about the strategy of revenue growth from here given the higher promotional environment? Is it important that you grow accounts or can you make the revenue growth on the existing base? And clearly, you're looking for customers to move up to premium unlimited. Where is that next now? And then second, where are we on the fiber builds and how should that start to come through in revenue and expense management this year? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Phil. Let me start by the subscribers then. I mean, first of all, we came into the third quarter already, I mean, we have our model with the migration of customers, giving them a better network and a better experience, and that is really how we are managing our base and we came with a good momentum in the third quarter. And so in the fourth quarter, we had service revenue growing more than 2%. That we said also in the guidance. That's so important for us because we have a model where our net addition is part of our strategy, how we move them up. And as Matt said, we have now more than 60% of our customers on unlimited, but more important, I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter, 90% of the new net adds took unlimited, and out of those 55 to premium. And the premium is of course where we are at the end of 5G we're adding in Discovery+, Disney+ the way that our -- that Ronan and his team has worked in with these migration path and we believe and as you heard in the guidance that Matt talked about, we believe that we can continue that work with the organic service -- wider service revenue growth with a model we now have, and we have proven the model over the years. And let's also remember the business side has performed very well when it comes to the wireless account. I mean, we are so strong with the public sector with large enterprises on the wireless side. So that is giving us a lot of positives going into 2021, with the guidance we\u2019ve of continued service revenue growth on the wireless side. And we will constantly measure what actions we're taking, but we feel good about it. When it comes to the fiber question, yes, we continue to roll out fiber. We're probably in the year three or four right now. We -- I would say, we -- the majority or vast majority of all the 5G sites they have our own fiber. We are migrating our 4G sites where it's a good return on investment t our own fiber. And over time, we will also open up opportunities for resell to our -- to enterprise customers and wholesale. So I think that we are seeing that benefit already on the 5G build, because we are using our own fiber. To get the full impact, we also have a couple of years left in order to have it in all the areas. But we are coming far away on a fiber build and we will continue to do it where it makes sense from a return on investment. So we feel really good about that and that\u2019s part of our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we will move to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. I think you called out in the release that COVID ended up being a $0.02 benefit in the quarter. I imagine that was probably a mix of things that were good and bad. So can you maybe could give us a little bit of insight into that. And then the EPS guidance that you gave for this year, what are you assuming about the COVID impacts over the course of this year? If you could give us any insight of how that breaks out? And then also one last question on guidance. Does that factor in any potential future spectrum purchases? Or is it just reflect the portfolio spectrum you have today? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the last question, and Matt can come back to the first. So when it comes to our guidance for EPS in 2021, of course, there are uncertainties of the pandemic and so on. But some things we know, I mean the roaming charges will continue to be a headwind. We also think that as the pandemic and economic recoveries is coming back, probably latter part of '21, the public sector will not have an equally strong year as they had in 2020. We also believe the SMB will continue to be subdued and have a challenge in '21. And as we saw, during the full year, the switch pool has been lower due to the traffic in the stores et cetera. So that that's we are factored in. But on the other hand, we have line of sight to what we're doing because we're executing on a strategy when it comes to migration of our customers. What we're doing in Verizon Business Group and also Verizon Media Group, as Matt said, they were now for the first time ever have a year-on-year growth of 11%. All in all, that is giving us the confidence that we can live up to this guidance. But there are some uncertainties and there are some headwinds from COVID, but we think that with those assumptions we have we can actually do this. And this is a continued work with the EPS growth and acceleration that we've talked about for so many years right now. And we continue to show that we can do with the assets we have and how we're executing. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Brett, just in summary on the COVID assumption and the EPS guidance, I think I'd say was certainly some level of pressures will continue to exist on the business throughout the year. I would say it's -- we're not overly pessimistic, but we're not overly optimistic either. We assumed some level of pressures that you saw from the second half of the year, our ability to still execute within that type of environment. In terms of the fourth quarter, as you say, there was actually the COVID impact was actually a $0.02 benefit. And what you saw there was a couple of one timers, but primarily it was a case of the revenue pressures we saw declining versus what we'd seen in 2Q and 3Q. You think you -- media as an example, which had been significantly hit by COVID impacts earlier in the pandemic, but certainly no impact in 4Q as we recorded that 11% revenue growth there. So those revenue -- some of the revenue headwinds moderated in the fourth quarter, the expense benefits continued. That's why you saw the $0.02 net benefit, which actually completely offsets the $0.02 headwind from 606. So, if you kind of think about in the fourth quarter, 606 and COVID have a no net impact on the results, and that $1.21 stands on its own the 7% increase on a year-over-year basis.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: All right. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you. Good morning. Hans, I wonder if you could talk about 5G monetization in 2021. You mentioned the expansion of the network, the Ultra Wideband Network, more 5G home locations, more Mobile Edge Compute. So can you just take us through both on the Consumer side, particularly 5G Home and on the B2B side, what we should be looking for and what you're kind of including in your forecast for '21?\nHans Vestberg: Yes, absolutely. We are excited about the 5G in 2021. I mean, on the mobility side, we're already seeing monetization happening. I mean in the fourth quarter, with so many customers taking the premium and going for unlimited, that's sort of where we have our sweet spot with the 5G. And, of course, with the Apple iPhone right now in 5G that has now kicked off that, so that you will see through the year when it comes to our mobility case. When it comes to 5G Home, we\u2019ve very solid progress in 2020, came out with this new CP, we added some 12 cities, now with 5G Home with the NR technology. And our plan is doing a 20 plus markets more in 2021. So now we're starting to get a solid foundation for the 5G Home. And as you heard in my remarks, I mean, we're doubling the amount of sites almost in 2021. So, we're now getting to a very, very solid positioning there. But I said before on the Ultra Wideband deal, we're building it mainly in the very dense urban areas and then in stadiums, et cetera in the beginning. So we covered less of houses or residential in the beginning. But as these continue right now, we're capturing more and more. So I'm really excited. We also know that the CPE is really good so and the self-install is working well. So we're looking forward to seeing that happening over the year more and more. On the 5G Mobile Edge Compute, we have a great funnel of customers on the Business side. And we are not expecting that will be in significant revenues into '21, but you're going to see a lot of customers signing up for the 5G Mobile Edge Compute both the private and the public in '20 -- in '21, in order for us to have a very solid base going in to '22. So, a lot of excitement around 5G. I think we have built it absolutely right. We have an opportunity in front of us that we have been working on for a couple of years right now. So, I'm happy with my sales team. I'm happy with the technology team, and we have a big year in front of us.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. I got three quick ones. First, in terms of the 3% plus service revenue growth, can you give us a sense in terms of whether that's weighted more towards subs or ARPA improvement? Obviously, you guys in your commentary talked about some of the headwinds to the sub growth. I\u2019m just wondering if you guys think you can maintain sub growth as you look through the year? That's number one. Number two, just any thoughts on the ability to continue to drive margin improvement in the business, given that considering you're close to achieving the $10 billion in savings. And then lastly, sort of a follow-up to Brett's question, is the CapEx guide that we've heard, is that something that could be revised during the year if the circumstances change? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Let me start, I mean, on the 3% growth, I think we have our strategy when it comes to how to grow with the migration of customers and all of that. And as always, the team is validating how to make offerings, if we should be more aggressive or not, but we always think about do long-term positive impacts for our shareholders financially. And you have seen us now working for the last 2.5 years since we launched unlimited, we are doing the right things in order to make a long-term impact positively for shareholders and for our customers. And so especially Ronan and the team, they\u2019ve quite a lot in the portfolio, but we have now proven that this model is working when it comes to migration of unlimited with the best network and adding in also new value-added services, everything from Disney+, the Discovery+, Apple Music and it might be more coming up in the year as well. So, I'm confident that guys have that in the portfolio. And as you heard about the Disney+, it's -- I think it's just unheard of how we can help the direct to consumers. I mean, two thirds are signing up or more than two thirds are signing up to continue to service after 1 year. I don't -- I think that is something standing out. On the EBITDA, Matt will come back later on, but I can say that we continued with efficiency. And it's the reason why we are giving a guidance that we will grow the EPS again, and the majority or all of it is basically above the line, as Matt said. So this is operational improvements, and improvements as we are growing our top line. Again, we have proven the model, the five vectors of growth and now we're in the middle of executing. And finally, on CapEx. This is what we need to do right now. We -- the technology team has all the means to have to execute on a strategy with assets we'll have to date. The only thing I can say, as I said, I'm not sure how many times before. We will only increase CapEx if we find something that has a really good return on investment. And then we'll come back and talk about it. Right now, we have everything that we need to execute the plans that we have in front of us.\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, John, so back to your couple of questions around the guide. As you think about the 3% service revenue, it's really a combination of subs and ARPA. Hans, obviously talked through all of the things that will drive the opposite side of the equation. But we certainly do expect subs growth, account growth, and net add growth is important to our business as well. We will do that in a disciplined way. We're not going to chase unprofitable growth, but you should expect to see volume growth in the business as well as ARPA growth. And then the margin improvement, cost savings where, as you mentioned, we're close to the achieving the $10 billion program well ahead of the end of 2021 timeline that we put in place. But just because we hit that doesn't mean we -- it doesn't mean we'll stop. There is significant opportunities to continue to make our business more efficient. The teams are very focused on those. And you know that the $10 billion goal won't change us -- won't slow us down at all from continuing with that. As you think about margin improvement, obviously, revenue will be a big driver of that. And then you combine that with the cost savings. The one thing I would say is, as we have an improvement in EBITDA margin dollars, if we have equipment revenue increase this year, which we would certainly be glad to see an indication of the overall economic activity picking up, you'd see an impact of that in the EBIT margin. So you could have EBIT dollars grow, but margins not grow as much just because of the impact on the numerator and denominator from the equipment revenue. But we're certainly very much focused on the dollar side of that equation, and excited with the guide we have for the year.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, John. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Hans, I guess the first question for you just on the strategy side with the sale of the HuffPost. Is this the beginning of a dismantling of the Verizon Media business? Is it on the block? What is the game plan for that unit as we think longer term for Verizon? And then, I guess the second question would be for Matt. Matt, you called out that the 2H '21 might have some tough comps for the business side of the business. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what that might be and what the numbers might look like? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. On the Verizon Media Group, I just want to remember you that we started this journey somewhere in 2018, resetting the overall strategy of Verizon Media Group. We started with that. We started to take out cost. We changed the product portfolio. We went into a very clear brand value of trust and privacy. The team has just done an outstanding job. I mean, they have bringing this from sort of going down with a decrease in growth of 15% to 20% per quarter. And now they're turning around with extremely sharp products as including also consolidating some, I'm not sure if it was 10 or 15 different ad tech platforms to one. I think it's great. We have put them in a position that we are really happy with. So, I'm looking for how these guys will execute, and we are now in the position where I wanted it to be.\nHans Vestberg: And then, David, on your question on the VBG volumes. So certainly, as you think about what we've seen this year, especially in the public sector part of Verizon Business Group, very, very strong year. Obviously, some of that is due to the circumstances that we've seen across the country. So I would actually be very happy if we saw some pressure on those volumes in the second half of the year. That would mean good things were happening elsewhere that would be very supportive of our Consumer business, very supportive of our SMB businesses as well. So certainly, it's part of some of the uncertainty that exists as we think about the year, but just wanted to call out the fact that if we see the improvements we expect, we may see the -- some impact there on the public sector side of our Verizon Business Group volumes. But as I say, I think that would be more than offset by other parts of the business. So, what you've seen and what we expect in '21 is a continuation of what you saw in 2020 is that as we have so many different parts of the business, irrespective of how the macro environment plays out, we can put together very strong consolidated results.\nDavid Barden: Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. I wonder if we could just talk about the competitive environment in wireless for a moment. Your gross additions remain, especially in Consumer, but across Consumer and Business, way down. Your churn rate remains very good and your ARPU shows signs of improving. That's sort of a different story than what we've seen for the last few years, which it sort of speaks to perhaps a moderation of competitive intensity, but clearly a weakening of your ability to acquire new subscribers. I wonder if you could just talk about that for a bit and talk about how you see that evolving in the 5G era as we -- particularly now that more and more of the handsets that are being sold are 5G handsets?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. First of all, I think the competitive landscape is always there and competition is also equal. I think that we just have a little bit different strategy. I mean, first of all, quality net adds is for us very, very important. And as you can see, we are adding this very important net adds. We want quality customers that likes our network, that likes our offerings and our experience. And if you look at what we have done in the last 2.5 years with our migration story, that's exactly what we have done. And that's what you see an impact in the fourth quarter. We are growing our service revenue as well as the guidance for next year. So we are confident with the strategy we have, and that might not be the same strategy that others have, that we can grow. And that's part of the five growth vectors we have to get to GDP plus. And with the guidance that Matt gave or we gave with plus 3% on the wireless service revenue, I think we have all the confidence in the model we have and how we'll work with. But it's also true that the switcher pool during 2020 in the fourth quarter was lower due to COVID, less traffic and all of that. So -- but all in all, we are very pleased with the high-quality net additions that we are getting and that we can create growth with that and continues on. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. Craig, I think the retention side of the business is performing very, very well and we are doing that through the quality of the network, the quality of the customer experience and not having to do anything additional to drive that type of retention numbers that you see. So, it's been a very strong story there, and we would expect that to continue.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks. And if I could just squeeze in one more question if I could, because -- and sorry to change topics. But your video strategy seems to be now quite different in wireline and wireless. In wireless, you're clearly with Disney and Discovery. You're sort of playing the Switzerland neutral arms dealer. I wonder if it raises any questions about for Fios. Does it make sense to stay in the video business as you currently have it, where you're still selling a direct package, or would it make sense to move to a similar strategy for the wireline side, where you sort of offer more third-party aggregators, if you will, across your network?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. No, first of all, you're absolutely right. On the wireless side, our D2C strategy is great. We have a platform that nobody else, when it comes to distribution, brand and network, and we can cope with this. We are not going to have 100 different type of offerings. But the discovery+, the Disney+, they are sort of super A brands that we want to work with or Apple Music. We will look for more of these to see that they're fitting into our customer base, that they like it and are willing both to upgrade and migrate. So, we will continue with that. On the Fios side, of course, we will continue with the video right now. But you\u2019ve seen us also starting with Mix & Match, starting to shop up this because ultimately, I want our customers to have choices. And I want them to choose. If they want the D2C solution or if they want a linear or they want over-the-top, they should be able to choose it. And look at the numbers in the fourth quarter again. We continue to grow our Fios Internet customers and we have a decline in the video customers. That's good for us, I mean, financially. But ultimately, it is to meet our customers' needs. And I think the whole setup that we did in Verizon 2.0 is just catered for us to do things that we never thought about before. We have a Consumer division thinking about how are we now delivering to consumers and that's what you see in the numbers. That's what you see in the numbers that we have. We have the same in Verizon Business Group. They are thinking totally different we have done before. And we still have more to do with platforms and things to be even more scalable and be able to bring more to the bottom line. But I have to say, I'm pleased and I hope that you guys, what you see, are pleased as well. I mean the strategy is working. We have the five vectors of growth. We are going into 2021, we have proof points on all those five, including the video strategy you asked about.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Craig. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, if you look at the improvement in postpaid churn year-over-year, can you unpack what portion of that might be coming from the pandemic and the lower switcher pool versus what's coming from the Verizon initiatives on the network strategy, the tiering and content bundling that you're doing or any other factors that you think may be improving retention? And then secondly, on the wireline business, is there at some point down the road a step function opportunity to take margins up, especially as you've continued to fiberize the local footprint? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I will start and will let Matt make some comments as well. But on the postpaid churn, I think that we are just having a great moment with our customers. They love our network and the performance we have and the additions we're doing with 5G and 5G Ultra Wideband. At the same time, our all offerings are so distinct and different than anybody else in the market, where they can go to the unlimited premium together with Discovery+ or Disney+ or Disney+ Plus, Plus. We have ESPN and Hulu included. I think nobody else has those type of things in the market. And our partners, at least if you ask them, I think you should, are very happy and pleased on how we can deal with this. We are happy with it, both from a retention but also from a bottom-line side. We were making money on this, which is the whole idea with the Network-as-a-Service that we're building on the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. On the wireline side, I think the whole idea of the Verizon Business Group is really to see that we are working these year-over-year. This is nothing that you fix in a month or a quarter or two. This is things that we need to invest in a billing system, direct-to-consumer, call centers, everything being set up to deliver scalable platforms for our customer in the Business side. That will, over time, improve our margins in the Verizon Business Group. And I think that if you look at 2020, I mean, it was a good performance of them, still doing investments in order to get where we want to get over time. And then we add to that new opportunities, like 5G Mobile Edge Compute. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So just back on the postpaid churn, Mike, for a second. Certainly, there is a pandemic contribution, but as Hans mentioned, a lot of Verizon specific pieces too. I'd also point out that the fourth quarter churn number included the impact. If you think about the Stay Connected customers, there was a delay in those customers going all the way through a collections process and so on. And so, you had a positive benefit from that in Q2 and 3Q, a little bit of a catch up in 4Q. But even with that, a very strong churn number, and it's just based off of the best network experience as you saw confirmed again by RootMetrics yesterday. When you put that together with everything else we do, customers who get on the Verizon network want to stay on the Verizon network.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you so much. Hans, I just wondered -- I was hoping you reflect back on the arrival of 5G in the United States and the prompt is, like a lot of people thought the iPhone 12 being the 5G and having all your bands in it would start a bit of a super cycle or not a bit of one, but a super cycle for consumers adopting 5G in the United States. I'm just curious how much of it sort of not happening in that way as due to the pandemic and the lack of getting people to retail versus the lack of applications that would really just sort of delight consumers and get them to upgrade? And how you think that\u2019s going to evolve over the next year or two or three? Is it going to be sort of a slow walk, or is there something exciting around the quarter?  And then for Matt, I'm just curious, beyond working capital, any other free cash flow swing factors for 2021? And is there any way to size or quantify working capital? It's kind of hard to tell looking historically what normal might be. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: When we talk about devices and what's happening with the upgrades and so on, I mean, remember also that the Apple 5G phone came out, I would say, late in the fourth quarter, that's when this all started, at the same time as we had the pandemic. Still, I would say we are very pleased what we\u2019ve seen with our customer migrating to 5G. Remember, we have a fair share or a big share of Apple users in our base. So, I think that this is a pretty normal, maybe some little bit subdued, but it's very normal upgrade cycle that we will see. And 5G will just getting better and better. I mean, that's what's happening. I mean, we are fortifying our network, we're improving the performance constantly. I remember when I talked about Ultra Wideband reaching maybe one gigabit per second, now we're up to four, five. So there's so much more to do. And the same goes for our nationwide, improving all the time, performance better. So, I think that is coming together as the accessibility to phones are coming out much more and all the main brands have a 5G phone and all of them with Ultra Wideband. So, I think that we will see that continuing into '21 and '22. But there are longer cycles today when it comes to customers migrating to new phone. They're very attached to it. But I think this is no different than 4G cycle. I think we actually are -- this is going faster than the 4G cycle. It's just that our memories are so short, so we don't remember that. But clearly, this is equal to, too better than what we saw in the 4G cycle that happened some 10 years ago, which I refer to myself when I talk about my memory, so nobody else. Okay, Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Thanks, Hans. So on, the cash flow question, Doug, so when you talk about the swing factors, obviously, it starts with higher earnings for the year. Above the line earnings will be obviously the largest driver in the cash flow for 2021. In terms of things that potentially go the other way from a cash flow standpoint, we would expect obviously higher earnings will lead to higher cash taxes. But in addition to that, we had the $2.2 billion one-time cash tax benefit in the second quarter last year that obviously won't repeat. So that will be a year-over-year difference in the cash flow. And then working capital, as you say, the biggest item in working capital is going to be in the receivables side, predominantly on the handsets. Obviously, as volumes go down, the amount of device payment contracts with customers we are doing goes down as well. So, even if we don't see an uptick in volumes this year, if they're just flat year-over-year, you have the removal of that tailwind from last year. So, all in all, you're going to see the increase from higher earnings with some offsets from cash taxes and hopefully on the equipment receivables side are going to be the key factors in there.\nDoug Mitchelson: All right. Thank you, both.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Doug. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nPeter Supino: Hey, good morning. I wondered if you could discuss the service revenue outlook, and specifically within Consumer, the incremental margin characteristics of the service revenue growth that you expect? How -- do you expect that revenue to be any more or less profitable than a normal level of service revenue?\nHans Vestberg: I think that was outlined -- the guidance for 2021, we are looking for profitable growth. And that is how Verizon has worked as long as I recall. Now I haven't been here all my life, but we work with profitable growth. And that is in the Consumer group as well. We will see that we have the best offers for our customers and we will manage our P&L at the same time and we will be aggressive, if it's needed, to get long-term effects. But as you can see from the guidance, it's a profitable growth we're looking for. We should be able to both grow as well as making that a profitable growth and that's in the guidance.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So, Peter, I think that's exactly it. If the 3% plus service revenue guide is going to drive -- is driving the EPS growth, that's in the guide as well. So certainly, it's profitable growth. In terms of comparing it to historical incremental revenue, I think there is obviously different components all the time. But absolutely, everything that we're doing to step customers up from a revenue standpoint also creates incremental lifetime value with those customers. So, you should expect that to be a continuation of how we approach the marketplace that we bring customers on, and we do it in a way that creates significant economic value for us over the long-term as we provide best-in-class experiences for those customers. Nothing changes there in our mindset.\nPeter Supino: That's a great explanation. Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Hey, Brad, we've got time for one more question. Let's do one more, if we have somebody on the line.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Just want to circle back on CapEx for a moment. I feel like messaging earlier in the year was that CapEx in 2021 would be up. And if you look at Street expectations, they were indeed expecting CapEx to be up in '21 versus '20. So, I'm just trying to get a sense what might have changed to have the CapEx guidance flat year-over-year? Secondly, Biden is proposing increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%. I'm curious how you think about that and whether that would have a huge impact on free cash flow and dividend coverage? Or do you think that there will be offsets that you would be able to kind of absorb much of that increase? And then just as a housekeeping, is TracFone included in your 2021 guidance? Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So thanks, Colby. Maybe I'll go in reverse order there. We -- while we expect TracFone to close in the second half of the year, our guidance is -- it doesn't assume any significant impact on the EPS during the year. But we will update that if necessary, during the year. Corporate taxes, our assumption, as you heard in the guide, 23% to 25%, that's where we've been the last few years. Obviously, we do our outlook based off of what is on the legislative books. And so, we do it based on what's there right now. We look forward to seeing how the new administration works on a number of different issues. And if that changes the way we look at the business going forward, we will obviously talk about that at the appropriate time. But we are very confident in the business. Look, we had good dividend coverage when we had a much higher tax rate not too many years ago. So while we certainly believe that the current rate has been very helpful in job creation and in economic growth creation, we are certainly very comfortable with how our business is set up as the administration is looking at different things. And in terms of CapEx, I think what you're seeing is a very efficient capital deployment model within the Company. That's why you see a guide that's in line year-over-year as we continue to do all of the things that we've done, whether that be on LTE, the 5G build. You heard Hans talk about our goals for the Ultra Wideband build this year, continuing the fiber build out. And so, I think the team has got a very good momentum going there. As they've got more into those things, the efficiencies continue, that's why you see the guide where it is.\nColby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Colby. Let me hand it back over to you, Brad, and we'll close up the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-10-21 15:26:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. As a reminder we have entered the quite period for spectrum auction 107. So, we will not be able to comment on our current midband spectrum holdings or strategies. Additionally, please remember to join us on November 11th for our Fall Sellside Meeting from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. We will be streaming this event live via BlueJeans for everyone that can attend virtually. You can find details on our Investor Relations website.  Now let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.05 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported results include a net pretax charge of approximately $1.1 billion related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities. Excluding the effect of this special item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.25 in the third quarter compared to a $1.25 a year ago.  Let\u2019s now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our third quarter earnings profile. Consistent with the approach we have shown for several quarters, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of Accounting Standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition in 2018. We expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of this standard will have a material year-over-year impact on our income statement.  We realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the third quarter, compared to the prior year primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.02 for the quarter and $0.07 year-to-date. For full year 2020, we continue to expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09.  Matt will go through the COVID impacts that we\u2019ve experienced across the business in more detail. Overall, we estimate that there was a $00.05 headwind included in the reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. While adjusted EPS was flat in the third quarter including the impact of COVID and ASC 606, we continue to see underlying growth in our operations.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady and thanks for everyone joining this third quarter earnings release from Verizon. I would like to start reflect over the current situation we have. Of course, I have mentioned several times [indiscernible] multiple crisis, the pandemic is continuing the economical downturn and the racial injustice. We, as a corporation had continued with our three-pronged governance to see that we are managing this in the best way.  Of course, our team is very focused on the crisis of the pandemic and having a team working on that. But the majority of my executive teams are working with business as usual to see that we continue to move this company forward.  And finally, we are also working a lot with new opportunities that arise from this crisis to see that we are actually coming out as a stronger company and actually serving our customers in even better ways.  I would like to say a couple of things on where we are in all this when it comes to our responsible business practices. Starting with the COVID-19, we have all the time put our focus on our employees\u2019 safety and health. That is being so important for us.  In this third quarter, we have seen our retail stores coming back to full operations. Of course with new procedures and processes. We have also seen our engineers being back in full force in the field to make installations and you are going to see that later on as we had a really great quarter when it comes to Fios installations.  On the racial injustice, and what we are doing here, we just want to highlight one important thing. This quarter we published our 2020 Diversity Representation Report. We disclosed on different levels, and different units where we stand on one of our core values which is Diversity and Inclusion.  I want to highlight the work that our treasury department did in the third quarter, they issued the second $1 billion green bond, which was led by minority-owned underwriters, continue our work with the climate change and seeing that we do our contribution.  And finally, we also decided in the quarter to provide our employees with paid time-off for employees to vote in these times which are unprecedented.  Moving on to where we are, and I talked a lot about as we came into this quarter and this second half of 2020, that this was the year of execution and I cannot say anything else that our team has been executing just fantastically. And if we talk about our network-as-a-Service, strengthening our network, starting with the 4G network, what can we say?  I mean, the team continues to take all awards. I mean the RootMetrics we named the best overall mobile networks. And on J.D. Power, we are awarded for the 25th consecutive time the best network quality. So the team is continuing to augment and improve our 4G network.  At the same time, we entered in the CBRS auction as you know, and we gained some 34 megahertz covering 140 million of the population. And all in all, that is going to help us to augment the capacity in the network especially on 4G.  Another area which we are very proud of that the team has done in the quarter is of course, continue their relentless execution of 5G networks and we launched the 5G nationwide last week and have said through the whole year that we are going to launch the network when it commercially makes sense. And it made sense last week when the iPhone 12 was launched in the market.  So now we have a nationwide covering more than 200 million of the population of the United States, more than 1800 cities when it comes to our 5G nationwide based on the DSS Technology. We also continue our expansion on the Ultra Wideband and we took a leapfrog with 19 more cities and we are now 55 cities for mobility with 43 stadiums and seven airports.  Just continue to augment our Ultra Wideband network which is just giving a huge new experience when it comes to the capabilities, when it comes to speed, latency, and of course, throughput. We also, in this quarter, launched some home cities when it comes to 5G Home or we added. So we have now eight 5G Home cities when it comes to fixed wireless access. And finally, one of the core assets for our network services of course is our fiber and the fiber richness of our network is a core element in the Verizon\u2019s intelligent edge network. We are on plan for that in these times. It\u2019s just a great work what the team has done all the way from the 4G network to the 5G networks and one fiber they are executing tremendously on our commitment for the full year.  All that network service strategy is based on us being able to monetize on top of that network. And a couple of very important events this quarter and a little bit after is of course setting us up with that monetization. Starting with the 5G adoption and the ecosystem that we are creating. We are of course extremely pleased with the launch of the 5G iPhone, the iPhone 12 that came out in four different models all with Ultra Wideband.  That is of course setting precedence how important Ultra Wideband is for unprecedented or unparallel experience on 5G bringing out all the currencies or capabilities that were talked about before.  Also this quarter, we added now the high power CPE for a 5G Home which we have been talking on for a quite a while. So now we are on the right track for that as well continue to be able to monetize on 5G fixed wireless access which is one of the different services we believe is going to be important for 5G.  And finally, the 5G mobile edge compute, which is the third business case we have on the same infrastructure, we have now five Mobile Edge Compute centers together with Amazon. We also announced that Microsoft is now joining also on the mobile edge compute, as well with a focus on the private side of the 5G Mobile edge compute.  So we are actually gathering some of the most important partners in the ecosystem to see that we can actually monetize these investments were done in a net together service. We are also having the \u2013 in the network continued with our Mix & Match and as we earlier reported that Ronan and his team has done Mix & Match 3.0 very important in times when there are so many choices. We give our customers the choices to pick their offerings and their way of dealing and getting services from Verizon.  Finally on that area, our collaboration within the company is very strong and as you saw during the iPhone launch, we launched with NFL the Super App or the Super Stadium App which was created by our Verizon Media Group which is basically seven concurrent video streams at the same time that they can enjoy either in the stadium which you cannot be today or at home if you have a 5G Ultra Wideband. Once again, we are part of a much wider ecosystem and to delivering new services.  We strengthened the core as well with a couple of new things. First of all, we are now going into the LTE home internet. We are covering 189 markets in 48 states. This is a one way for us to continue to use our great network to offering new types of services.  In the quarter, we also announced our ambition to acquire TracFone, that is adding new opportunities for us in the value segment to support that segment of customers.  Finally, on the business-to-business applications, which is the growth on top of the 5G mobile edge compute we now have five Mobile Edge Compute centers as I said. We are committed to do ten by year end and we both have now Amazon and Microsoft as partners to build that.  Finally, we have seen great opportunities based on our investments in universal communication services where we have added our BlueJeans acquisition, especially in health and education and as you are going to hear from Matt later on, we have a great growth in our public sector very much based on that.  I am really proud of my team that they can deliver this strong financial performance in the third quarter in these unprecedented times as well as with the strong execution of our platforms and our strategy.  On the consumer side, we added some 142,000 new postpaid phone net adds and continue with a very high loyalty for our customer with a very low churn levels. As I alluded to earlier, we are also very proud of what we achieved in the Fios.  In the total Fios, we added 144,000 new internet net additions. That\u2019s a five year high, which is a great work of our Fios with the Mix & Match as well as their offering and the quality level of Fios. Of course there were some pent-up demand, but all in all it\u2019s also showed the support from our customers for our Fios offering. On the Business side, we continue to do well on the wireless side both on the wireless gross adds and net adds. We have seen in the Business side the secular decline in wireline.  We had a good profitability in the quarter even though we continue to invest and we are not done with the investment we talked about in the fourth quarter last year that is so important for us to see that we are really supporting our customers when it comes to new digitalization and new offerings. But all in all, good work by our Business group.  Finally, the Media Group had a sequential improvement. There were down 7% in growth in the quarter. They had very good improvements during the quarter when it comes to growth trajectory.  Finally, they continue to add a lot of new opportunities, especially around own and operated where we have good growth in the monthly active users if that is in news or in finance, we clearly see that our content is really aspiring and doing well with our customers in those areas.  And finally, our ad tech, especially the demand side platform is having quite a lot of new customers in these times which also shows the proof of all the transformation that we have done in the Media Group.  So, looking at the financials, we had growth in our service revenue, wireless service revenue in the third quarter with 0.3%. We are clearly have been very focused on that one and it exceeded a little bit also what we said when we concluded the second quarter. We also had an improvement and growth on our adjusted EBITDA margin with 100 basis points and that includes of course the COVID impact.  So we clearly see that even though we have a decline due to hardware, we are managing our P&L in a good way in all our units. The cash flow continues to be strong. We have continue to have cash flow in the quarter even though we have the dividend and some outlays for some acquisitions of spectrum.  Finally, we are doing a positive update on the EPS guidance that Matt will talk about later on. So we feel good about going into the fourth quarter with a very solid third quarter when it comes to financial and execution and how we are dealing with the different crisis that is happening around us here in the U.S. and in the rest of the world.  So, I will then hand it over to Matt to go into more details on the financials. \nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. As we\u2019ve now completed the second full quarter in a global pandemic, I am encouraged by the strength and resilience of the Verizon team, our business and our customers. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitment to our customers and our communities in the phase of uncertain and evolving conditions.  This quarter highlights another example of our ability to execute and drive results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 included in estimated net impact due to COVID of approximately $0.05. In the third quarter, consolidated operating revenues were $31.5 billion, down 4.1%.  Revenue declines were primarily driven by significantly lower wireless equipment revenue, which was down approximately 20% due to lower customer activity and the timing of certain device launches.  We are pleased our total wireless service revenue outperformed our expectations by returning to year-over-year growth in the third quarter driven by improvements in usage and fee revenues and step up the premium tiers of unlimited.  In addition, Verizon Media Group\u2019s revenue trajectory improved significantly during the quarter driven by advertising, which returned to year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $11.9 billion, down slightly from $12.0 billion in the prior year, driven entirely by headwinds from the deferral of commission expense.  Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 37.6% versus 36.6% in the third quarter 2019 including headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from the commission expense deferral. Our business excellence program continues to drive significant benefits as a key component of Verizon\u2019s resilience and agility.  We have realized $8.3 billion of cumulative cash savings to-date and remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion by the end of 2021. Even after we achieve our target, operational efficiencies will be an ongoing focus across the business to identify additional long-term transformation initiatives and deliver the related cost savings.  Let\u2019s now turn to our segment results starting with Consumer Group on Slide 9. Our Consumer team continued reopening our retail stores throughout the quarter, while maintaining vigilance for the safety of both our employees and customers. We began the third quarter with nearly two-thirds of our retail stores open, although with limited hours and gradually reopened across our entire footprint with normal operating hours by Labor Day.  Consumer foot traffic is not yet at pre-COVID levels as we have implemented social distancing practices such as Touchless Retail, appointment scheduling and curbside pickup. We remain committed to providing our customers with the experience they expect while focusing on their safety.  For the quarter, we added 17,000 postpaid customer accounts, compared to a loss of 26,000 in the prior year. We are pleased with the early traction we have seen from our new Mix & Match plans as the best-in-class value offering which now includes an expanded bundle from Disney in the top tiers of our unlimited plans.  Our enhanced unlimited line-up is driving elevated step-ups and we now have approximately 60% of our customer accounts on unlimited plans with over a quarter of those on premium tiers. Customer retention remains very high and is a function of reduced customer activity levels across the industry, as well as a testament to the Verizon network performance and ever-improving customer experience.  Postpaid phone churn of 0.63% was an improvement of 16 basis points from a year ago. We continue to see strong customer collections based on the demand for our services and the quality of our customer base.  Our Stay Connected payment plan that allows keep Americans connected customers to pay off their service balance over six months has been well received including Consumer and Business customers, we have approximately 1.2 million accounts on these payment plans with over 90% having made a payment and the majority with current balances.  Based on our early activity, we expect involuntary churn in the fourth quarter to be modestly higher than typical levels, but to remain better for the full year compared to 2019. We will continue to work with these customers to keep them connected during these tough economic times.  While postpaid phone gross adds were down approximately 22%, primarily due to lower store traffic and changes in timing of phone launches, our low churn drove postpaid phone net adds of 142,000 for the quarter, as compared to 239,000 in the prior year. The retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low at 4.2% and contributed to the decline in wireless equipment revenue.  In addition to the strength in postpaid wireless, prepaid net adds of 77,000 marks our best performance in several years. We look forward to the completion of the TracFone transaction to further enhance our position in this segment where we have been historically underrepresented.  In Consumer Fios, internet net additions of 139,000 were up significantly both sequentially and year-over-year. Total Fios internet net adds across the company were 144,000, which is our highest total since the fourth quarter of 2014. The demand concerns of customers appreciation from our new Mix & Match offerings and the quality of our product when reliable internet service is more important than ever.  Our Fios team did an excellent job working through the installation backlog from 2Q and we are nearing normal pipeline levels after limiting operations in 2Q for precautionary safety purposes. Consumer Fios video net losses of 61,000 improved slightly as live sports content has picked up, but core cutting remains the key driver of video disconnections.  Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 10 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues were down 4.3%, primarily driven by a significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to reduced customer activity. This decrease was offset partly by growth of 3.1% in other revenue, and wireless service revenue was stronger than expected.  Wireless service revenue improved sequentially and was down 0.7% year-over-year, compared to negative 2.7% in the second quarter as customer activity started to recover. The pace of step-ups to premium tiers of unlimited has increased during the quarter and drove underlying growth in service revenue through higher recurrent access charges.  Usage and fee revenue improved sequentially throughout the quarter, but international travel pass remains at low levels. Altogether, usage, fees and travel pass revenues accounted for approximately 180 basis points of year-over-year pressure in the quarter.  Consumer EBITDA margin was 47.4%, which was up approximately 210 basis points from the prior year despite approximately 60 basis points of headwinds from the deferral of commission expense.  Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 11 to review the Business group results. Our Business segment continues to be resilient as our customers appreciate the quality of our best-in-class network and product offerings. Demand in the public sector remains especially strong as our team has done an excellent job providing critical solutions to customers across state and local government agencies and to education providers. Despite ongoing wireless volume pressure in small and medium business and enterprise, postpaid churn remained in line with 2019 and we have seen a steady increase in customer activity since the second quarter.  Total Business postpaid phone gross adds were down approximately 8% from the prior year. Postpaid phone net adds of 141,000 was down 206,000 in prior year, but was almost double sequentially as our customer activity continues to return towards pre-COVID levels. Business segment postpaid phone churn was 0.96% in the quarter improved slightly from prior year driven by favorable retention trends in public sector and small and medium business.  Suspend activity continues to be favorable as the majority of our suspended accounts are shifted to active status. Our Business segment customer bases remained resilient but macroeconomic conditions will continue to play a factor in the fourth quarter and into 2021.  Let\u2019s now move to Slide 12 to review the Business financial performance. Total operating revenue to the Business segment were down 1.7% from the prior year. Wireless revenue is down slightly due to declines in equipment revenue, partially offset by service revenue growth of 4.9% as compared to 3.1% in second quarter.  This was primarily driven by public sector and small and medium business and included approximately 280 basis points of headwinds predominantly from lower roaming and usage revenues in the quarter.  Operating revenues were also impacted by ongoing legacy wireline declines. However, demand for advanced communication services continues to drive underlying opportunity for the segment. Business EBITDA margin in the quarter was flat year-over-year at 25.2%.  Now, let\u2019s move on to Slide 13 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Trends resulting from the pandemic continued to impact both search and advertising. However, we are pleased with the sequential improvement from the second quarter.  Total revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, down approximately 7%, compared to last year, better than our expected range and up 21% sequentially. Year-over-year trends continued the improvement that began late in the second quarter as September revenues were down only 2.4%, compared to 19% down in June.  We continue to drive increased customer engagement on our owned and operated properties with strength in both finance and news as monthly active users grew 22% and 13% respectively. For the quarter, we saw ongoing strength in our demand side platform adding more than a third client accounts compared to the prior year.  Verizon Media expanded our partnerships and increased our commitment to build advertising inventory in new and emerging formats and launched live events with Watch2Gether and Yahoo Sports PlayAR. All of these platforms will benefit from 5G and our robust partnership with the NFL to Anywave live events together.  Let\u2019s now move to Slide 14 for a quick look at the overall Wireless performance. Slide 14 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer business segment for the third quarter.  Total Wireless Service revenue was up 0.3% from the prior year including the headwinds mentioned in both the Consumer and Business segments, a significant improvement from the 1.7% decline in the second quarter.  Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules in our website.  Now, let\u2019s review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 15. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $32.5 billion, an increase of $5.7 billion from the prior year. The growth was driven by continued performance and strength of the business, a non-recurrent tax item in the second quarter, improvements in working capital primarily due to low volumes and payments related to the voluntary separation plan in 2019 that did not repeat this year.  As a reminder, we paid three of the four quarterly Federal tax payments in the third quarter including two payments that were deferred from the second quarter. Year-to-date capital spending was $14.2 billion, up $1.8 billion from the prior year.  Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in traffic on our industry-leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build out of our 5G Ultra Wideband and nationwide networks, the upgrade to our intelligent Edge network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60 plus markets outside of our ILEC footprint. The net results of cash flow from operations and capital spending is year-to-date free cash flow of $18.3 billion, a $3.9 billion year-over-year increase. Additionally, we invested $1.9 billion to CBRS spectrum to further enhance our network strategy.  We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and opportunistically diversify our debt portfolio to optimize our cost of borrowing, ending the quarter with net unsecured debt of $96.5 billion, down year-over-year by $1.3 billion.  Our cash position remains strong finishing the quarter with $9.0 billion. In September, we completed our second green bond issuance with proceeds of $1 billion, primarily in support to our goals to source 50% of our electricity consumption from renewable energy by 2025 and be carbon-neutral in our operations by 2035.  The issuance also supported diversity and inclusion in the underwriting syndicate, strengthening our longstanding partnership with minority owned financial firms on capital markets transactions.  Our net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0 times. We\u2019ve remained focused on achieving this target over time while maintaining a strong financial position to give us flexibility to invest in the business.  Let\u2019s move on to Slide 16 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Hans and I are very pleased with the performance of our team in the third quarter building on the momentum we\u2019ve seen over the past several quarters in the phase of an uncertain operating environment, we are seeing steady improvement across our business.  Wireless Service revenue in Consumer and Business is recovering faster than we initially anticipated, and we expect total wireless service revenue to grow by at least 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.  We previously guided to full year adjusted EPS of negative 2% to positive 2% change from 2019. Given the three quarters of resilient earnings, and the trends we see into the fourth quarter, we expect 2020 adjusted EPS to be accretive and are revising our guidance upward to 0% to 2% growth for the full year.  This includes the previously discussed accounting headwinds, the impacts from COVID, and new device launches in the fourth quarter.  We are extremely proud of the Verizon team that puts us on track to deliver earnings growth in a year with truly unprecedented challenges. There is no change to our guidance for other income statement items including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate. We expect our full year CapEx to be at the upper-end of our $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion guidance.  The supply of the network equipment is strong and we continue to deploy fiber and small cells at a tremendous pace in order to enhance our network leadership position and achieve our goals for 2020. Our performance this year through three quarters have shown the strength of a great team, a resilient business and a sound strategy.  Our focus on our core competencies and the strength of our balance sheet has given us the ability to invest in the business and support all of our stakeholders in times of uncertainty.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of the year. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Let me just quickly summarize where we are. I think we are in a moment where we are executing against our strategy in a really good way and we are creating the opportunities for our growth that we are aspiring for.  And let me start with the 5G. There are so many things we have done in the last three months and into this quarter that is really paving the way for our best network and for our customers to enjoy this tremendous opportunity to be on 5G. When it comes to strength in our core, new partners are important for ecosystem, but we are also looking to new segments.  You heard me talking about the 5G mobile edge compute that we continue with, but also ambition to acquiring TracFone to see that our network and service is really the fundamental strategy that we can monetize on top of and see that we continue to be the leader in this market.  Finally, new revenue model, many of them were being discussed, but clearly we see new opportunities especially in the Business group with 5G mobile edge compute also based on what\u2019s happening with healthcare and education and we are taking care of some of them already, but more opportunities coming with partners that we have announced this quarter, but also important in the future.  So, all in all, a very good quarter. I think we are in a very strong position to continuing the fourth quarter and into 2021 as we are executing on our strategy.  With that, I hand it back to Brady for the Q&A.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we are ready to take the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I am sure you are not surprised, but the principal topic of conversation with investors over the past week has been the iPhone 12 promo that you rolled out and that your peers have rolled out. And if we look at the way yours is structured, it\u2019s effectively a subsidy. And so, the question we\u2019ve been getting is, what got you comfortable with the nature of that subsidy design?  What positive impact are you expecting to see on your operating performance as a result of the promo? When are we going to see it as, as investors and analysts? And is there anything about the initial acceptance of the promo that has given you a sense that it\u2019s working or that you need to adjust? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I mean, let me start by saying that we feel really good about our position and first of all with the network we have, the offering that we are doing based on the Mix & Match, but also the offering you are alluding to. And then, of course, the position we have when it comes to the iPhone 12 where we have Ultra Wideband in all of them. So, I think we are operating with positional strength.  We feel really good about our offerings. We also feel good about the response. I mean, it\u2019s very early. I cannot say so much about the pre-orders. Remember, there is only two phones that is in pre-order right now. There is coming two other iPhones, the 6th of November when it comes to preorders. But we are happy with the preorders so far.  And as you have seen from Matt talking about the guidance, we feel also good about the quarter and how we are going to handle this. And as you know, I mean, this is not the first time we are into a cycle of iPhones and our guys, they know how to deal with these and they are very financially prudent seeing that long-term and medium-term this is going to be very positive for our customers and shareholders.  So, we feel really good about it. Matt? \nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. And Brett, thanks for the question. So as I look at the promos we have around the iPhone right now, the overall construct isn\u2019t very different from what we had previously. Some of the details are obviously changed from promo to promo, but this construct is very similar to what we\u2019ve done for the past few years really since we\u2019ve been in an unlimited world.  So, we are certainly expecting to see good customer take rates. We expect that to drive step-ups as we get more customers on unlimited and expect that we are very focused on driving value accretive growth across the customer base and developing long-term relationships with our customers and the promos we put in place right now are very consistent with that methodology that we\u2019ve had for many years now. \nBrett Feldman : And just one quick follow-up question. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve made a decision on this yet or not. But for how long do you expect this payment offer to be in the market? \nHans Vestberg: We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the market develops here over the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll tell you what, I am very excited when you think about having the best network both 4G and building the best 5G network, you add it with the best device portfolio. You add that in with the best value proposition with what you\u2019ve done with, what we\u2019ve done with Mix & Match 3.0. That is an incredible combination.  And so, there is a number of levers available to us. But I\u2019ll tell you what, Brett, I am very happy sitting here today holding the card in my hand that we have and look forward to how the marketplace will develop in the fourth quarter.\nBrett Feldman : Okay. Thank you. \nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brett. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead with your question. \nPhil Cusick: Hey guys. Thanks. First a follow-up on Brett\u2019s. Can you give us some idea of what has to happen to hit the high-end or low-end of the fourth quarter earnings guide? I think a lot of people are pretty impressed with the high-end and I imagine that that would have to be a lot less competition than we are seeing in the market today. But appreciate your thoughts.  And second on customer payment trends. You are the first major service provider to report. Can you give us more details on the Keep America Connected recovery trends in Consumer and Business payments? Are those on time? And you forecast that churn should pickup in the fourth quarter. Can you help us quantify that at all? Thank you. \nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Phil. So, starting with the first question on the fourth quarter range. So, when you look at, at what are you thinking about the momentum coming out of the third quarter and the momentum that\u2019s built in the third quarter with customer volumes improving as we are with the store service revenue back to growth, step-ups driving that.  The move to 3.0, I\u2019ll tell you within the service revenue growth of 0.3%, it improved throughout the quarter. The number was better in August and July and it was better in September than it was in August. So, good momentum coming into the fourth quarter. The best Fios growth number that we had in almost six years. So a lot of positives across the company as we come into 4Q.  And then, as you come into the quarter, not just the iPhone launch, but 5G nationwide. A lot of exciting things going on.  So, when you look at the year-to-date EPS number, we are up a penny on a year-to-date basis and so we feel very confident with the momentum we have coming into the quarter that we will ultimately have accretive EPS for the year as a whole even with the impacts of COVID in there and the accounting headwinds you heard from Brady and everything else. So, it gives us a really good place to finish the year and jump off into 2021.  On the customer payment trend side, again, very, very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen from customers on the stay connected program that we\u2019ve put Keep American Connected customers into at the beginning of 3Q. But payments have been in line with what we expected. We have a very experienced collections process. We have the best quality base of customers in the industry and you see that come through in the churn results.  As we get into the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll start to see the small percentage of those customers that are still struggling with the payments get all the way through the collections process and a very modest uptick in involuntary churn. But I still expect involuntary churn to be below last year on a full year basis which speaks to the testament of the work our team does and the quality of the customers that we have. \nPhil Cusick : Thanks, Matt. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we are ready for the next question \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead. \nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can we talk a little bit about, from the millimeter wave network perspective, the kind of two aspects to the business? One being the mobile network connectivity, you talked about the pooling about five times more small cells in 2020 as you deployed in 2019.  But I think that people don\u2019t have a sense as to kind of a footprint or a number that you can put around that and thinking into 2021 is the iPhone 5G becomes the thing. Can you quantify and elaborate a little bit about what the goals are for that mobile Ultra Wideband network?  And then, second, as you kind of gotten out to eight cities with the 5G Home, can you kind of put a number around what is that addressable market look like today and what is the goal for that to look like in 2021? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you very much. Let me start, and first of all, I mean, our strategy has been consistent over years and when it comes to the Ultra Wideband and the deployment has also been very consistent. And remember, when it comes to the Ultra Wideband, it\u2019s just an unparalleled experience. I mean, you might have seen that yesterday we actually made a test that we come up to 5-Gig right now.  So, this is just giving some totally different experience and that was the whole idea when we started it; we wanted to build something enormously transformative and that\u2019s what we have and that of course is playing into the whole roll out of the iPhone 12, as well, that is all capable of Ultra Wideband.  When it comes to our roll out, I mean, last week we added 19 cities and the majority of the cities where already launched were almost double the size of the footprint. So, we are in an enormously big roll out on ultra wide band. And as we said, five times more base stations this year compared to 2019. I will give you one number.  I mean, the last two months we deployed more radio base stations than we did in entire 2019. That\u2019s the pace we are up to. So we are a footprint this is growing and even though there is no people or spectator in stadiums with the Super App with NFL, what we are doing is of course, we have 5G in the stadiums and we can project that out so you as a user you can get that experience by not being in the stadium with seven screens.  So, I see we are continuing through the transformative things and the whole ecosystem is around us. As you have seen, we are now up to five different sites with Amazon commercially, on the mobile edge compute we are building a lot of great opportunities and transformative business transformations with it. So, we are really excited about it and we can see the consumers are excited about that as well.  But we are augmenting every day and I am extremely happy with our net technology team deploying this together with the fiber we are doing at the same time. So, you will see more and more we are just augmenting the Ultra Wideband network.  And as I just need to also state that, remember, we also launched our nationwide 5G covering more than 200 million people, which is on par or better than our 4G which clearly is the best in the nation as I said, I am not sure how many times I\u2019ve won the RootMetrics, J.D. Power and now we are having that nationwide.  So, we feel really good about our situation when it comes to network and what we can give to our customers.  On the 5G Home, you are right. We are now in eight cities. We have \u2013 we are also augmenting of course those cities with Ultra Wideband and we have two more cities before year end. But I said before, I mean, there is no reason why any city that will have mobility and will not be a 5G Home city as well.  And now, with the CPE that we came out with early in the fourth quarter, we also have a very compelling offering, very transformative, with a self-install, with a CPE that is much more powerful than the previous ones, much easier to detect and all of that. So, we feel good about that. That doesn\u2019t change what we have said before when it comes to our revenue trajectory for 5G and different business cases we have.  But what it shows is that we are really in execution mode right now and bringing monetization on top of our 5G investment that we are been on to for the last three, four years or as long as I remember, because I was been in for 2.5 years, because we have all the time been on this strategy. So, I am very pleased with this third quarter.  We have more to do in the fourth quarter, but a lot of things are coming in place for us right now to really talk about our strategy. \nDavid Barden : Thanks, Hans. \nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, you may go ahead. \nJohn Hodulik : Great. Thanks guys. I think I got three quick ones. First, the strong service revenue growth guidance for the fourth quarter. What\u2019s driving, what appears to be accelerating migration to the higher tiered unlimited plans?  That\u2019s number one. Number two, given the earnings guidance, and the fact that year-to-date you have some slight earnings growth. It would appear that you are not expecting much dilution in the fourth quarter from what we are seeing on the iPhone. And I guess, given the promotion job there, does that mean that you don\u2019t expect a meaningful increase in overall volumes in the fourth quarter this year as we look versus last fourth quarter?  And then lastly, follow-up to David\u2019s question, on the millimeter wave, obviously, inclusion in the iPhone would seem to be a big positive for you guys from a competitive standpoint. Hans, is there any opportunity to go faster with that 5G deployment?  I know you are doing five times to small cells that you did last year, but it would seem to be a nice competitive sort of advantage for you guys to get that out there as soon as possible. I am just wondering from a CapEx standpoint, does it make sense to go to put the pedal to the metal. Thanks. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Let me start just hitting a little bit on service revenue and then millimeter wave and then I will hand it over to Matt. So, on the service revenue, I just want to reiterate the strategy. We ever have since we launched unlimited and the work that Ronan and his team are doing as well as Tami when it comes to our Mix & Match, et cetera.  This has been a journey where we are differentiating our customer experience towards any of our competitors. I mean, first of all, we can Mix & Match. Number two, we have offerings with partners that no one else have, everything from Disney Plus to App and Music. We have just put the totally different way of dealing with our customers and that you see the payout.  Remember, in the fourth quarter and the third quarter last year, we were in a fantastic trajectory on the service revenue and then we all know what happened in the pandemic. And then, now we are showing that we are back and as Matt said on the service revenue, we had better trajectory in the months of August and in July and in September.  So the guys are doing a great job. I will leave it back to Matt later on for the service revenue comment, but that's how I feel about it. How good these guys are doing this. On the millimeter wave, yes, I agree with you, we are just creating a competitive advantage with the whole millimeter wave and the Ultra Wideband and you can see that all the partners we are lining up are really excited about it. If it's Apple or if it's the Wild Rift, which is the biggest game in the world that will be exclusive with us. All of that is happening at the moment. I am pushing the team every day to go faster.  Now we have also unconstrained supply. I mean, we didn't have that last year when we were so early on this and some might not remember that the conviction on the world was that 5G will start to be deployed in 2020. We have commercial network with 55 cities went nationwide. I mean, we have pushed the envelope of technology with the ecosystem since 2015 to be where we are today.  But, don't worry I am pushing and I am going to push, as well and we are managing this within our CapEx, as well. So, the team is doing well. We are giving them all the resources they need, because we understand what the competitive advantage we are creating. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Thanks, Hans. So, John, on the service revenue growth, so, certainly the migrations to unlimited are part of it. But if you look at the improvement quarter-over-quarter and I know there is a lot of focus on the Consumer side, but I'd be remiss not to point out the improvement on the Business, side as well. Business service revenue increased from 3.1% growth in 2Q to 4.9% in 3Q largely in public sector and small medium business.  And as good as our market share is in Consumer, it's even better in the Business segment. So that continues to be a driver of service revenue. But within the Consumer side, certainly continued migrations to unlimited and as we continue to add value to the proposition, which you saw us do with Mix & Match 3.0, we continue to see more customers migrate over and not just migrating over, but more customers are migrating over to the upper tiers of unlimited, as well. We see more of our new accounts taken unlimited than we've ever seen. And we think there is continued opportunities within the base to migrate people over and step them up further. So, good trajectory on service revenue and headroom for even more to come. On the EPS guide, you are right. We feel good about where we'll be in the fourth quarter here and you see that in the guide and as you think about the iPhone promos, while certainly we think those are value creative for us. I'd also draw your attention to, especially on the Consumer side how the accounting of those promos under the 606 accounting standard.  The - a large part of those promo cost will be amortized over the next 2.5 years or so, rather than hitting the income statement upfront. So, from a 4Q standpoint, the iPhone promos are more of a working capital issue than they are an EPS issue.  But as we think about the forward view, that's hopefully baked in and feel very good about where we should be in the current quarter and the jump-off point into 2021 and even with an increase in volumes coming through year-over-year, we expect to be accretive on EPS for the full year.\nJohn Hodulik : Great. Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, John. Brad, we are ready for the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir, you may go ahead.\nSimon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Strong numbers on the Fios internet side. Perhaps you could just unpack how much of this is the delays from the installation backlog from Q2? And what sort of the underlying trend both on adds going into Q4? And also on ARPU, what sort of speed tiers are you seeing? Are people upgrading within the Fios space there? And then, maybe, Hans, you could just speak to the broader economy, there is concerns that as some of the fiscal stimulus ends, we will see more small business closures et cetera. What are you hearing from CIOs and others as you engage with them? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Hey, Simon. Thanks for the question. I'll take the Fios one, first. So, with a lot of great effort by the teams during the quarter and what you really have is a fantastic product and a fantastic team putting out there and you see the results. So 144,000 net adds on internet in the quarter was our best in almost six years. There was a little bit of impact from working through the backlog from Q2.  But I can tell you, even without that backlog impact, we'd have been significantly north of 100,000. So, it's \u2013 well, that was a factor, it wasn't the driving factor. The driving factor is the quality of the product, which customers' value now more than ever and combined with the Mix & Match product that we brought \u2013 the pricing proposition that we brought into Fios from wireless in the early part of this year.  And when you brought those things together, we are seeing great results. So strong demand has continued into October and I would expect we will see normal level of seasonality in 4Q, where we see a little bit of a drop-off in overall industry volumes and as you get toward the holiday season, but great to see us taking share again, in the Fios world.  And again it's just the combination of both the great product and you put it together with the Mix & Match construct. And it's really resonating in the marketplace. So, and then, I think we still have room to grow there with a good amount of customers still with the opportunity to step up to a gigabit speeds.\nHans Vestberg : On the broader economy, I mean, I can only say two things. I mean, first of all, I mean, the public sector customers and the large enterprise customers, in general, very high activities. There are, of course, certain large enterprises that are a little bit subdued, because they are industries that are having a very tough times like the airline industry and tourism or transport. So, - but all others, I would say, the activity level is higher than ever. Many are taking the advantage of digitalizations and actually changing the way you are working and this is playing straight into our strategy that we have been deploying for years, both with the technology, but also with the go to market we designed 2 years ago or 1.5 year ago. And finally, I think, the small and medium business, that's where we see the challenge, because we still have companies that have closed down and are waiting to see if they are going to get back. It's not getting worse.  But we still have that concerns for small and medium businesses that are hard to say. So, when I talk around with my colleagues in the industry, the CEOs, they see the same a little bit. We don't know where the small end business will go after this. It depends on how long this economical downturn will be. But we haven't seen a worsening at least lately. So, that's where we are.\nSimon Flannery : Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Sir, you may go ahead.\nCraig Moffett : Hi, thanks. I want to ask a question about gross additions, if I could. AT&T's promotion seems to be quite different than yours and T-Mobile's and that it's very much focused on retention. And, just given the gross adds are already down sharply and the cable industry is taking a good chunk of gross add growth, how do you think about gross additions going into the fourth quarter and into 2021?  Is there the potential that the market is sort of starved of growth here and that it forces a more competitive stance or a more aggressive stance from you in particular, but for the industry overall?\nMatthew Ellis : Craig, thanks for the question. I think the only thing I can say to that, I feel very good about our expectation for gross additions going into the fourth quarter. We got the right combination of the best network, the great handsets out there, the right customer propositions. I think, we'll do very well from a gross addition standpoint here in 4Q.\nCraig Moffett : And, thanks, Matt, and if I could just ask a follow-up about the cable industry, just the cable industry is now having \u2013 has its own 5G promotions. How do we think about 5G under the cable contract, the MVNO contracts that you have with the cable industry? Is it fair to assume that you reopened the contracts for special pricing just given that - at least, I think most people's understanding is that the original contract was priced on a per gig basis of some kind and that that would be hard to do in millimeter wave given the kinds of volumes that somebody could run up?\nHans Vestberg : Hey, Craig. First of all, as we all know, the large MVNOs in these countries, together with us and we are very happy with that. They are very good customers to us. We have a good relationship with them and they have been taking some share.  And again, it's playing straight into the strategy we designed for two years ago, the Network-as-a-Service to actually monetize the network and the capital spend better than anybody else in this market. I am just happy to see that what's happening. I cannot go into any contractual things we are doing. But, again, we are happy. I guess they are happy, as well. So, that's how it works.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Craig.\nCraig Moffett : Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. A few if I could. First, could you just break out the $0.05 of COVID dilution? Where that would appear in the income statement during the quarter? Secondly, as you described the cost-cutting program is starting to get to the homestretch towards that $10 billion target by the end of 2021, where do the remaining savings come from in terms of the business activities? And is it an expense opportunity for savings or CapEx savings opportunity? And then, just finally on a more-broad basis, I was just wondering if you can give us an update on how you see the importance of content bundles in your wireless rate plans. And is there is any further developments on the aspirations the management team has described to leverage the consumer base for more bundling opportunities in the future? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Hey, Mike. So, as you think about the $0.05 COVID impact in the quarter, down significantly from second quarter, obviously $0.14 down to $0.05 and we saw an improvement both on the wireless fees, especially on the usage side and also the media revenues. But within the $0.05, the biggest item right now that's contributing to that is travel, travel pass and roaming revenues.  So, most of the $0.05 impact is in the service revenue line in the income statement. We think the number will be a little less than that in the 4Q and continue to decline as we go forward. But obviously, travel pass will be a \u2013 will be an ongoing headwind for some time here. As you think about the cost-cutting, you said we are in the homestretch. I am not sure I agree with that statement. We are certainly close to the $10 billion target. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we are not stopping there and I see tremendous opportunities for us across the business continue to improve the efficiency of our processes and operations and some of the changes that we've made during the course of the pandemic have only shown us additional opportunities that are ahead of us. So, we'll get to the $10 billion and then we'll just keep on going. And then, finally, the importance of the content bundle as you mentioned, the teams are always looking at the right way to bring the best value proposition to our customers and we are in a unique position given the size of our customer base and the quality of our customer base. We are very much the partner of choice for a lot of content providers.  We are very happy to have bring the Disney bundle into the 3.0 construct and if we see other ways to bring value to our customers in a way that also brings value to us, we'll certainly continue to look for those. But we are very happy with the pricing constructs and the overall value proposition we have in the marketplace today.\nBrady Connor : Great. Thanks, Mike.\nMichael Rollins : Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson : Thanks, so much. I think the iPhone questions are taken. So, Hans, my question is, just kind of a funny one. How patient are you? You've had a singular focus on wireless and 5G since you've taken over. It's a low interest rate environment, unprecedented bond market, capital is cheap, you are intensely focused on wireless leadership.  So how long is your investment horizon? If you see a great investment opportunity, maybe a large and one-time opportunity, does it have to cover what is now a bit lower cost of capital in three years, seven years, ten years? How do you think about investing in terms of timeframe, Hans? And Matt, sort of paired with that same question on the balance sheet, you mentioned the idea of getting to your target leverage over time and again, the debt markets are so attractive right now. I would think that would give you more balance sheet flexibility and elongate the timeframe by which you might need to hit that target range.  How do you want investors to think about what over time means? Is that a year or three years? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : On the first question, first of all I am happy that we have answered all the iPhone questions, because that's an important piece for us, because it was such an important event for us last week. So, thank you for that. On the horizon on investment, they are of course different depending what we are investing. So it's hard to just make an answer.  But clearly, we are trying to monetize as quickly as we can on all the investments we are doing and that's why we are talking so much about monetization right now as we have done quite a lot in the network, all the way from the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network and with all the 5G. And all the 5G use cases that we outlined, the three business cases are now up running commercially. So now it's up to our sales team to sell.  I mean it's Ronan, it's Tami, it's Guru, the three CEOs that now needs to get out with a sales force to sell on it, because Kyle, which is running the technology, has bumped this network up to something that we have never seen before. So, that's how I see it. So, it's really execute right now.\nMatthew Ellis : Hi, Doug, on the balance sheet flexibility, I mean, we \u2013 our capital allocation model continues to be what we are aiming toward and we are very happy with the progress we've made on the balance sheet. It gives us the flexibility and the agility to pursue opportunities as they come up. As you've seen that even in the course of this year, we've done with BlueJeans, with TracFone, and certainly with the spectrum transactions that have taken place already this year.  So that will continue to be our focus to have that target and we'll get there as quick as we can. But no change to how we are thinking about capital allocation.\nDoug Mitchelson : Right. If you wouldn't mind me sort of adding a follow-up to that, Hans, when should investors expect to see a material level of 5G revenue given all your efforts on that front? Is there a sort of a timeframe or a year we should think about where we are going to go, Aha, there it is?\nHans Vestberg : As we outlined, I think already 2018 when it comes to 5G Home and mobility, we would start seeing something in 2021 and then, the 5G Mobile Edge Compute is for 2022. That's what we said already, I think at the Investor Day at 2018 or 2017. So, we stick to that and we'll execute on it and this team they are phenomenal group of executives I have here in Verizon.\nDoug Mitchelson : Thanks so much.\nBrady Connor : Yes, thanks, Doug. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar : Thank you. So, couple if I could. I mean, first is, Hans, I mean, on TracFone, could you just contextualize the objective why the change I\u2019ve heard in prepaid \u2013 with respect to prepaid, is it more a commentary on the macro environment and the saturation levels in the industry? Or is it more from the perspective of an origination pipeline?  Obviously, the deal is accretive financially, but strategically, what's the broader goals that you are hoping to solve with that? And secondly, I guess, there has been a lot of headline last couple of days around the Google payment to carriers and the amount seems meaningful enough and it's pure margins for the most part. So, if you could just help us understand how big revenue streams from application providers are and where that shows up in your P&L that might be helpful? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Okay. On the TracFone, our strategic intent is, of course, going back to the Network-as-a-Service and seeing that we monetize the network in a best way. And of course the value segment is a growing segment that is also giving us growth. So, we are hitting on two of the main objectives here. One is of course, we will monetize our network better than anybody else in this market and the capital invested.  And secondly, be part of the growth and seeing that we are actually playing in all different segments of the market when it comes to wireless. So that's the objective and as you might know the majority of these customers on TracFone, they are already on our network. So, that we have the synergies from it. But clearly that's how we see it. But we need to close it first.  We have said that\u2019s in second half of 2021. So it's a while until we get there. So, we will definitely give you more updates on that as we go on. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Kannan, there is a certain amount of revenue that we get from application providers, but it's not a material part of the overall revenue stream.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Kannan. We can't go more than that. Brad, we're ready for the \u2013 we have one last question. We are going to go to one more and then we are done for the day.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is open.\nTimothy Horan : Thanks guys. Can you give us some color around how many fixed wireless subs you think you can have kind of longer term? And what \u2013 when do we kind of ramp up to kind of full ability to add kind of customers on a monthly basis? What do you think that runrate would look like?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. On the fixed wireless access customers, as I said, we have now two offerings in the market. We have one, which is 4G and then, of course, we have the 5G which is a big push for us. We have said we're going to address 30 million households over the five to eight years.  That's where we \u2013 what we are addressing and hopefully, not hopefully, our ambition is to take a fair market share of that one as we've done with the Fios. So, that's what we're pushing for and our team is always geared to do better than the expectations. So, of course, we are pushing them hard. And as we are releasing more and more sites and more and more homes for sale, we're going to start reporting it.\nTimothy Horan : And how important is the new equipment? How much better is it? And how easy is it to install?\nHans Vestberg : It is a step change. I will say, it's clearly a step change when it comes to both the self-install, but also how much more we can cover with that CPE, because it's bringing so much more of the signal, compared \u2013 remember, the first CPE we had was basically smartphone chipset sitting in the CPE. That's what we had. So basically, we had a smartphone being the CPE.  This is catered for being indoor or outdoor CPE and as we have reported before, we have a lot of indoor installations right now, because this is working very well. So, it is a step change and mainly because we can address so many more households from one radio base station. That's the importance of it.\nTimothy Horan : Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Tim. That's all the time we have today. Everybody be safe and have a great week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Web site. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our Web site. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.13 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported results included a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $255 million, including a net pre-tax loss of $102 million related to early debt redemption costs and a net charge of $153 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.18 in the second quarter compared to $1.23 a year ago. Let's now move to Slide 4 and take a closer look at our second quarter earnings profile. Consistent with the approach we have shown for several quarters, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition in 2018. As a reminder, we expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of this standard will have a material year-over-year impact on our income statement. As we illustrated in previous quarters, we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the second quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.02 for the quarter and $0.05 year-to-date. For full year 2020, we continue to expect the headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09. Matt will go through the COVID impacts that we experienced throughout the quarter in detail in his section. Overall, we estimate that there was a $0.14 headwind included in the reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. In addition, we recognized an aggregate tax benefit of $156 million in connection with a series of legal entity restructurings related to an internal reorganization, which resulted in a benefit of approximately $0.04 within our reported and adjusted EPS. So adjusted EPS was down 4.1% in the second quarter as a result of the impact of COVID and ASC 606. We continue to see underlying growth in our operations. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and thank you, everyone, for joining this earnings call. Let me reiterate what I said in the first quarter. We are in unprecedented times with multiple crises and a business that we need to run at the same time. I can only say to all of you, I\u2019m extremely proud how Verizon and our employees have responded to all of it. I think of this quarter as a quarter where the stakeholder capitalists strategy of Verizon really bear fruit. I have reported many earnings calls in my life. This quarter it comes together with a good support of our employees, a great support to our customers when it comes to our network and our flexibility, a big contribution to our society when it comes to how we acted and supported to the site in these tough times, but also a very good and solid financial result for our shareholders. That\u2019s a really good sort of ending of the second quarter or the first half of a very unprecedented year. We have continued as a leadership team to work in a three-prong governance. Part of our team is working with the daily crisis to see that we are doing the right things and with the right priorities in this pandemic, economical downturn, racial injustice that is ongoing in the country. The second part is of course working business as usual and seeing that we continue to lead and deliver results for all our stakeholders. And finally, in a third prong is to work with what are opportunities created from this pandemic, economical downturn so we come out even stronger as a company after this is coming out to a new normal. Our strategy and our underlying strategic priorities have not changed during this time. They have been reconfirmed that we are on the right path with our network-as-a-service and our go to market. Many of the things that we outlined in the Verizon 2.0 are really playing a vital role for us being able to deliver to all our stakeholders, especially to our customers in times like this. One of the transformations was of course to have a purpose-driven company where our employees are very engaged and excited of our future, but also seeing that they\u2019re doing the right thing for our society. If I look back on the first half and looking back on our response to the COVID-19, I think we have done very well. We have decided to prioritize the health and safety of our employees. Not only that, we have also started to return to office with very safe protocols to see that our employees actually can work in the offices if they want to. But if you then look at our frontline, which never closed and never worked from home, they have continued to innovate. They innovate with the curbside delivery in our stores, Fios in a box, et cetera. And as Matt will later on talk about, we have seen a great uptake on those innovations when we look into the latter part on the second quarter. If we then talk about the racial injustice that we\u2019re seeing in the country the last couple of months, I\u2019m also proud for how we have brought that together with our team to discuss this, having a conversation in the company but also with our partners and externally. No one can say we\u2019re done enough and we just need to continue to do that. At the same time, we\u2019re donating money for some of the most important foundations that can support that transformation. Finally, I\u2019m also proud that we have packaged all our activities that we are doing for our social stakeholders in what we call the Citizen Verizon. I will not dwell on that today, but is an important piece of our overall strategy. In addition to serving our employees and society, we have of course also been very focused executing on our core business and our core strategy, and continue to develop our platform for a network-as-a-service. I\u2019m extremely pleased to report that once again for the 25th time we are winning the award for the best LTE network from J.D. Power. I have to say the engineers in Verizon have continued to amaze me and they will continue to do so in the future. Remember in February, we made some bold statements about our deployment on 5G in 2020 all the way from the Mobile Edge Compute, 5G Home cities, 5x more small cells on 5G and some 60 cities on the 5G Ultra-Wideband as well as a nationwide coverage on 5G with DSS. I\u2019m happy to report we\u2019re on track on that, and in some cases even ahead of the plan. We are continuing to deploy our technology. Our test with DSS is going very well and as well, we have launched some of the 60 markets when it comes to mobility and some additional markets on 5G Home. However, you\u2019re going to see that in the second half of this year we have a lot of new things happening and building on the foundation of the strategy and the strategic priorities that Verizon has outlined the last couple of years. If we then look into the different segments and first of all starting with Verizon Consumer Group in the second quarter, continued to gain improvements when it comes to the customer loyalty, not only in national but also by creating new services. We saw them coming up with Verizon credit card in the second quarter and they continued to gain a lot of accounts based on their mix and match and the way we have developed the ladder with different unlimited offerings. I\u2019m really happy what Ronan and his team have done and you\u2019re going to see in the financials and operating numbers that even with the challenges we\u2019ve had, they had performed very well. If you look at the Verizon Business Group that are in the middle of the transformation and I have to say the way they are now dealing with customers are bearing a lot of fruit. They are progressing well with the transformation and I\u2019m also happy to report the acquisition we did in the second quarter of BlueJeans are performing well and the growth both on usage and new customers are continuing going very well. And I was also happy last week to announce a large partnership with Airtel, one of the largest carriers in the world, to use BlueJeans for their corporate customers in India. Finally, on the Verizon Business Group, 5G Mobile Edge Compute, an important piece of our growth strategy, we have said that we are going to have 10 5G Mobile Edge Compute sites this year deployed. And now we\u2019ve also started gearing up our partners. We have announced IBM and we also talked about SAP as two very important application providers that are going to take part of our deployment and that we\u2019re collaborating with right now. So we\u2019re creating a lot of excitement around the 5G Mobile Edge Compute and a lot more to come in the second half. Finally, Verizon Media Group, of course being impacted by the advertising markets coming down. We see them coming back a little bit in June, but anyhow they have done also quite a lot of work to see that we continue to create more monthly active users on our owned and operated properties, and they also made an agreement with Walmart, which is of course one of the largest companies on earth to see that they are using Yahoo! Mail as a grocery and purchasing platform. Finally, our financial team under Matt has continued to do good work on our balance sheet. We are coming out from the quarter with elevated liquidity. But not only that, we have continued to work well on our net debt. And we have reached credit metrics levels similar to pre-Vodafone level. So that\u2019s really good work by the team. If we look into the financials of the second quarter, and Matt will cover that in more length, I only want to say that we had a very good quarter. We showed resilience. Of course, there are challenges in certain customer groups like Verizon Media Group, small and medium businesses, but many others have actually been performing well. We also need to remember in the quarter we have had not all our stores open when it comes to consumers, as well as limited sort of visiting hours, et cetera. However, if you see in the momentum we have created on the consumer side, we added 26,000 consumer postpaid accounts this quarter, which is, I would say, a good work compared to a loss one year ago in the second quarter. We also are on historical lows on our churn, and all-in-all that is giving us a good EBITDA in the Verizon Consumer Group. Finally, I would just want to highlight the very strong cash flow. Of course, we have some extraordinary tax items there, but in general it was a strong cash flow quarter. And as Matt will talk about later, we have not increased our bad debt reserves in the second quarter and he will also allude to we have good metrics when it comes to what happened in June compared to the rest of the quarter. So all-in-all, I think we have executed well for all our four stakeholders in this quarter. And by that, I hand it over to Matt to go through the financials in more detail.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let me echo what Hans said. The second quarter was unlike any other we have seen and I\u2019m extremely proud of our team and our performance. The results demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the agility of our employees to not only adapt to rapidly changing conditions, but to deliver for our customers and communities while also producing strong financial results. Due to the strength of our business model, we delivered a $1.18 of adjusted earnings per share. This includes an estimated net impact due to COVID of approximately $0.14, primarily driven by impacts to wireless service revenue and lower advertising and search revenues from Verizon Media Group. While the company's performance year-to-date has been strong, there is still a high degree of uncertainty regarding when and how quickly the economy will recover. We are confident that we are implementing the right approach to meet demand as consumer and business activity increases. Let's begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results on Slide 7. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenues were $30.4 billion, down 5.1%. Results reflected significant declines in wireless equipment revenue which was down approximately 20% in the second quarter, primarily due to limited in-store engagement and the impact of COVID on customer behavior. As we highlighted in the previous earnings call, consolidated wireless service revenue was impacted by the commitments Verizon made to waive certain fees and provide additional data for our customers as well as significant changes in customer roaming activity during the quarter. In addition, we experienced low advertising and search revenues within Verizon Media Group as customers scaled back their advertising campaigns. Included in the impacts from COVID, adjusted EBITDA was $11.5 billion as compared to $12.1 billion in the prior year. This is primarily the result of the wireless service revenue impacts from lower advertising and search revenues. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.9% as compared to 37.7% in the prior year, and includes headwinds of approximately 30 basis points from the deferral of commission expense that Brady discussed earlier. Through our business excellence program, we have realized cumulative cash savings of $7.2 billion and remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by the end of 2021. We will continue our focus on operational efficiencies even after the current target is achieved. The current environment provides us with the opportunity to explore additional longer-term business transformation initiatives and related cost savings. Let's now turn to our segment results, starting with Consumer Group on Slide 8. Our consumer team quickly pivoted to adapt to the new environment. In mid-March, we temporarily closed the majority of company-operated retail stores and transitioned most of our employees to work from home, including telesales and customer service roles. We optimized our sales channel to drive more activity through online and through telesales, while introducing touchless retail and curbside pickup to streamline the customer experience as we reopened our retail stores. People are depending on connectivity now more than ever and they need reliability and quality of service. And because of that, we are seeing them increasing choose Verizon. For the quarter, we increased postpaid customer accounts by 26,000 as compared to a loss of 34,000 in the prior year, highlighting the momentum in the business and value of the Verizon customer experience. We have seen activity levels increase during the quarter with an expansion of overall volumes in May and June. Customer retention is at an all-time high and is both a function of customer activity as well as a testament to the Verizon network performance and customer experience. As a result, postpaid phone net adds were 97,000 for the quarter as compared to 73,000 in the prior year. While phone gross adds were down approximately 26%, we experienced phone churn of 0.51%, an improvement of 21 basis points from a year ago. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low at 3.9% during the quarter, contributing to the decline in wireless equipment revenue. Fios Internet net additions of 10,000 were down sequentially and year-over-year as Fios installations were limited during the quarter due to temporary restrictions put in place on work inside customers homes. Our team responded with innovative solutions and developed self-install capabilities. And beginning in June, we resumed technician in-home visits across our footprint. Fios video net losses were consistent with previous quarters as cord cutting trends continued. Now, let's move to Slide 9 to discuss the consumer financial performance. Consumer operating revenues were down 4%, primarily driven by significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to low activation levels. This decrease was offset partly by growth of 15% in other revenue, primarily driven by recurring services such as device protection. Wireless service revenue was down 2.7%, primarily driven by declines in roaming, usage and waived fees that accounted for approximately 320 basis points of pressure in the quarter. Consumer EBITDA margin was 47.0%, which was up 50 basis points from the prior year and includes approximately 40 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Margins benefited from lower equipment volumes in the quarter, but as a reminder lower equipment revenue has a limited impact on consumer EBITDA dollars as the segment primarily operates on a device payment model. Now, let's move to Slide 10 to review the Business Group results. Reliable and secure conductivity have never been more critical, as companies continue to adapt to new ways of supporting their employees while simultaneously driving their businesses forward. During the quarter, our business team responded to the challenges of COVID, handling increased traffic needs while also meeting a surge in demand for connectivity and devices, particularly from public sector and enterprise clients. While wireless demand remained high throughout the quarter in public sector, we experienced offsetting pressures in both small and medium business as well as global enterprise. As a result, segment phone gross adds were down approximately 17% from the prior year contributing to postpaid phone net adds of 76,000, down from 171,000 in the year ago period. Business segment phone churn of 0.90% in the quarter was down 7 basis points year-over-year, driven by strength in public sector. Let's now move to Slide 11 to review the business financial performance. Total operating revenues for the business segment were down 3.7% from the prior year. Wireless revenue was down year-over-year due to declines in wireless equipment revenue, offset by 3.1% growth in wireless service revenue primarily driven by small and medium businesses as well as public sector customers. Wireless service revenue growth included approximately 400 basis points of headwinds from lower roaming and usage revenues in the quarter, which are likely to continue in the third quarter. Suspended lines as a percentage of the base have come off the highs we saw earlier in the quarter, but remain above pre-COVID levels. The likelihood of these lines returning to active status is primarily a function of macroeconomic conditions and will be a significant factor in upcoming wireless service revenue growth rates. Operating revenues were also impacted by legacy wireline declines. However, global enterprise wireline revenue was nearly flat in the quarter, a significant improvement primarily resulting from strong demand for advanced communication services during the pandemic. Business EBITDA margin in the quarter was 26.2% as compared to 27.3%, which included approximately 20 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Now let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss Verizon Media Group. As expected, the economic environment around COVID had a meaningful impact on both search and advertisement performance in the quarter. Total revenue was $1.4 billion, down 24.5% compared to last year, primarily as a result of COVID-related impacts. We continue to drive increased customer engagement on our owned and operated properties and saw monthly active users up approximately 4% with strength in both Yahoo! Finance and News, which were up 45% and 25%, respectively. For the quarter, we added a third more client account on our demand side platform compared to the prior year and signed key partnerships with leading content and e-commerce companies. As a combination of this strong momentum, Verizon Media won Adweek Readers' Choice Best of Tech Partner Awards for all four nominated categories; DSP, SSP, ad network video and ad network mobile. Let's now move to Slide 13 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 13 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services for the consumer and business segments for the second quarter. Total wireless service revenue was down 1.7% over the prior year, including the headwinds mentioned in both the consumer and business segments. Phone gross adds were down 23.3%, while phone net adds were 173,000 as compared to 244,000 in the prior year. Phone churn was 0.58%, down 18 basis points in the prior year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and our supplemental earnings release schedules on our Web site. Now, let\u2019s review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on Slide 14. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $23.6 billion, an increase of $7.7 billion from the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in the business as well as non-recurring items and timing differences. These items include the COVID-related postponement of approximately $2.0 billion of second quarter tax payments to July 15, the receipt of the previously disclosed $2.2 billion cash tax benefit related to preferred shares in a foreign affiliate sold during the fourth quarter of last year, improvements in working capital primarily due to lower volumes and payments related to the voluntary separation plan in 2019 that did not repeat this year. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $9.9 billion, which was up approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expect the capital spending to be more frontend loaded and we see that in our first half results. Our capital expenditures further support capacity for traffic growth across our networks, while we continue to deploy more fiber and additional cell sites to expand our 5G rollout. We maintain our full year 2020 CapEx guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $13.7 billion, a year-over-year increase of 74%. Despite the pandemic, our balance sheet was further strengthened in the quarter. We continue to operate with elevated liquidity levels which we believe is appropriate in this environment. During the quarter, we further lowered maturities through year-end 2022 by $3.8 billion with liability management transactions, which also improved overall portfolio borrowing costs. We now have no unsecured bond maturities for the remainder of this year and less than 1 billion in 2021.  Our overall net debt for the quarter decreased sequentially by $5.7 billion. Net unsecured debt totaled $94.4 billion for the quarter resulting in a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio about 2.0x, down slightly from last quarter. Though we are at the high end of our targeted range of 1.75x to 2.0x, we continue to manage our balance sheet under our capital allocation policy. Our estimates at the leverage ratio Standard & Poor's uses for their credit rating analysis is now less than their boundary for an A minus rating. Therefore, we have now met our commitment to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile. Let\u2019s move on to Slide 15 to take a deeper look at the trends we have seen exiting the second quarter. This slide highlights select key metrics of year-over-year results for both the full quarter and the month of June. Our various customer groups experienced a wide range of trends in customer demand during the quarter and exited the period with different trajectories. As restrictions began to ease during the second quarter, we gradually started reopening our company operated stores with limited hours and our new touchless retail approach to further employee and customer safety. At quarter end, more than 50% of our stores were open, up from roughly 30% in April and we expect to be close to fully opened by the end of July, conditions permitting. As a result, we exited the quarter with significantly better levels of consumer activity than at the beginning of the quarter. Consumer postpaid wireless gross adds declined approximately 21% in June, a material improvement over the decline seen in April. In June, upgrades were relatively flat versus the prior year, given pent-up demand, the availability of more 5G devices and a new lower priced iPhone. Despite the increased gross add activity, churn remains historically low in June. In Fios, we transitioned from an initial period of not performing installations to the introduction of Fios in a box in late April to having technicians resume entering customer homes in the beginning of June, and we are constructively working to bring our installation pipeline to normal levels. This activity led to a significant improvement in Fios Internet gross adds in June, which is carried into July. In our Business Group, we have separated results for the different customer groups as they experienced different trends. We continue to see significant pressures in small and medium business. June gross add declines of approximately 23% of small and medium business were in line with the impacts experienced with the onset of the pandemic, while phone churn was marginally higher. Similar to consumer, upgrade activity was more robust in June. While we are encouraged by the June trends, we may see ongoing impacts to this cohort. In April, we highlighted the surge in demand for connectivity within our public sector and certain global enterprise customers. As we exit the quarter, we continue to see robust demand for both phones and connected devices within the public sector. In global enterprise, we experienced the year-over-year reduction in wireless volumes beginning in mid-April, but exit the quarter with improvements in gross add activity. We remain committed to serving the needs of these important customers, including all those on the frontline as they continue to adapt to new ways of doing business. Throughout the quarter, we made a number of voluntary commitments, most notably participating in the FCC's Keep Americans Connected pledge to ease the impact on consumers and small businesses by waiving various fees, agreeing not to disconnect eligible customers for nonpayment and providing increased data to metered customers, among other initiatives. The effect of these commitments, along with reductions in roaming and other usage-based activity, resulted in headwinds on total wireless service revenue in the quarter that were in line with the expectations shared on our first quarter earnings call. Ongoing impacts to customer behavior from the pandemic mean that usage-based revenue, including roaming revenue and travel pass is likely to be suppressed for some time. And we expect total wireless service revenue in the third quarter to increase sequentially and for the year-over-year growth rate to improve from the second quarter and be within a range of negative 1% to flat. We are encouraged by the payment trends of consumers and small businesses that opted in for the Keep Americans Connected pledge with the majority of these accounts making some payments while under the pledge and more than one-third of such accounts current at the end of the pledge. At this time, we have taken no additional bad debt reserve. We continue to monitor payment trends and we\u2019ll reassess as needed. We are working with affected customers and have a long and successful track record in this area. These customers value the communication services that are vital to their everyday lives and we value the longevity of these relationships. To that end, we have enrolled many impacted customers in a repayment program beginning in July, providing extended terms for past due service and device payments. We believe the vast majority of these accounts can be cured over time, but it will heavily depend on the macroeconomic environment. As previously mentioned, declines in Verizon Media revenue were consistent with the anticipated range provided in April. Although trends improved in June and were down approximately 19% as compared to the prior year, advertising is rebounding faster than search with strength in our owned and operated properties. Given this trajectory, we anticipate that the revenue decline percentage in Verizon Media will be in the teens in the third quarter. Now, let\u2019s go to Slide 16 to discuss our guidance and outlook for 2020. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw building throughout the quarter but would also note that a fair amount of uncertainty remains in the operating environment, particularly as many states now confront rising COVID cases and some are re-imposing restrictions. The second quarter demonstrated our ability to produce strong earnings even in a challenging operating environment. We are maintaining the outlook provided in April for adjusted EPS to be within a range of negative 2% to positive 2% for the full year. It is important to note that our guidance assumes no significant deterioration to the macroeconomic environment or material changes to our bad debt reserves. Guidance for other income statement items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate remain unchanged from our initial outlook. As mentioned previously, we are maintaining our full year CapEx guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. At the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve communicated expectations for CapEx to be frontend loaded in 2020 and that is exactly what we have seen. We continue to have good access to the supply chain for equipment and related items and remain confident we can achieve our built-out plans for the year. In summary, I am proud of this team\u2019s performance in the second quarter, adapting to unprecedented circumstances while continuing to make strides moving our business forward. Our balance sheet remains strong and provides us confidence to continue to invest in the business while also supporting all of our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of the year.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. And let me summarize a little bit where I think we stand when we\u2019re now entering the second half of 2020. First of all, I think we are entering with strong fundamentals where the network that is performing very well, I talked about the J.D. Power and the LTE network is really performing well. We\u2019re entering the second part of 2020 with a growth mindset, with a lot of key strategic partnerships as well as activities. Our 5G are, of course, of essence, coming into the second half, but that\u2019s already been built in as we\u2019re building so much in the first half. The way we have been dealing with the pandemic and all the other crisis will continue, of course, in the second half. And I think we are coming in with a good foundation and with a strong brand, but also a strong employee sentiment, how we are actually dealing with the situation. And as I said before, Matt has prepared the balance sheet for us to be strong when it comes to going into the second half. And if I look into the second half of 2020, we\u2019re of course exciting for scaling the 5G to nationwide, scaling the Ultra-Wideband to over 60 cities, scaling the 5G Home to more than 10 cities, and of course start monetizing that. That\u2019s going to be a key focus for our executive team, as well as capturing all the opportunities, especially on the 5G Mobile Edge Compute where our business-to-business applications and the way we\u2019re working with our partners as well as the partners that we have acquired, like BlueJeans. Finally, we also have a lot of customer innovation when it comes to our Mix and Match, as well as how we\u2019re seeing that our customer can follow us on the journey all the way from the limited plan up to the unlimited plan. And as we have heard previously, the way that Ronan and the Verizon Consumer Group has been working in the second quarter, we have continued to gain success with our unlimited. Our customers are moving together with us up the ladder. And we are also continuing to expanding into new customer groups with Visible, Yahoo! Mobile and others. And we\u2019re working to see that we are addressing the full market with opportunities, regardless how the second half will look like in 2020. So, all-in-all, I think we are in very good position for executing and leveraging all the things we now have prepared in the last 18 months. So by that, let me kick it back to Brady for starting the Q&A.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. And just a quick note before we get into Q&A. I just want to remind everybody we\u2019re in a quiet period for CBRS given the auction and the anti-collusion, so the comments we make around this spectrum will be very limited. With that, Angela, let\u2019s get started and take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good morning. Matt, thanks for all the color on the trends in June, very helpful. I wonder if you could unpack the $0.14 of COVID impacts and how much of that is sort of particular to Q2 with Keep America Connected plan and what elements do you think will continue on into Q3 and beyond? And related to the outlook, you did talk about some of the SMB pressures, but generally global enterprise wireline revenues were holding up given presumably some increased demand for capacity, et cetera. But how are you seeing \u2013 we\u2019re seeing stories about IT budgets getting cut. Are you seeing any signs that we may see more pressure on that side in the second half of the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can start and Matt will chip in. I can say that in the quarter, Simon, we met so many enterprise customers. And yes, there are of course some that are more hit than others that of course are very cautious on the IT budget. But the majority of the large enterprises, they feel that this is the time to digitalize. This is the time to actually use the momentum to be more digital using capabilities all the way from SD-WAN to video conferencing to 5G Mobile Edge Compute. So I actually see a very good momentum with these type of customers. And I just wanted to chip in there before Matt comes in and comments to COVID 19 impacts. Matt?\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans. Thank you, Simon, for the question. So $0.14 of impact from COVID in the quarter, the vast majority of that is driven by revenue both service revenue within the wireless side of the business, predominately in Consumer but some in Business and then also the impact in Verizon Media Group. So the service revenue, obviously there was a couple of major components to that. One is the actions we took. We talked about the Keep Americans Connected pledge but also the increases to customer data plans, those who aren\u2019t on unlimited, had that during the course of the quarter as well. And then you had the impact from customer behavior, primarily around roaming. So as you think about coming into the third quarter, as we said, we expect service revenue to be better in 3Q than it was 2Q getting closer to flat on a year-over-year basis versus the negative 1.7%. That\u2019s going to come from growing the accounts, growing the net adds that we had coming through but also because we don\u2019t have all of those things taking place in the third quarter at the moment that we had in 2Q. But we do also expect customer behavior to continue to reflect what\u2019s going on. So we certainly don\u2019t expect roaming revenues to be at the levels they would have been without COVID. That will continue. And then you mentioned on the business side, especially within SMB, that\u2019s a customer group we\u2019re paying close attention to in terms of how they navigate this obviously very difficult environment working very closely with them, but certainly there could be some pressure there. But all-in-all, the pressures that we saw in the quarter from COVID were as expected. So we\u2019ll have some of those as we continue into Q3 and see some improvements in other areas as well.\nSimon Flannery: And so it will be below $0.14, but it will still be sort of enduring impact on some --\nMatt Ellis: We\u2019ll wait and see how the environment plays out here, but certainly we can \u2013 some of the things we\u2019d expect to be a little bit better. As we mentioned on Verizon Media Group, they were negative 25% in revenue in Q2. We said we expect that to be in the teens in 3Q. That should give less of an impact there. Service revenue, we hope we\u2019d see a lower impact but we\u2019ll see how the quarter plays out obviously. Over the past 30 days or so, we\u2019ve added a level of uncertainty to the forward view with everything, the number of COVID cases around the country, so we\u2019ll see how the quarter plays out here.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks for the color.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Simon. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess I want to follow up on that answer, Matt. Obviously at the top line, we\u2019re seeing some sequential improvement. The question I think that people have is as you start to see the equipment revenue velocity or the equipment volume velocity improve in third quarter, are we going to see an equal or potential even offsetting effect on margins as we kind of look ahead? And I guess the second question I have would be just kind of zooming out a little bit and thinking about the 5G millimeter wave. Obviously, the critique has been that 5G millimeter wave availability is not that great. Is there any way that you guys can kind of offer some kind of metric or some kind of KPI on 5G millimeter wave availability in the markets where you\u2019ve put it out so we can kind of measure its growth? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Hi, David. Let me start on the millimeter wave and have a discussion about that. So, as I said, we are on plan to deploy more than 5x more millimeter wave base station this year compared to last year, so the footprint will be much broader and we will be into 60 cities and those cities will be much more covered than they were last year. And we are disclosing that \u2013 usually on a fairly frequent basis how that map is growing. As you have seen, we have launched fairly few markets the first half when it comes to the 60, so you should expect quite a lot of noise from us in the second half and we\u2019re really excited about that. But you also need to think about our model will also include nationwide, so think about our model being a millimeter wave that is transformative. No one is even close to it in the world. Then we will have national coverage on top of that. And then in the bottom, we have the best 4G network in the world. And then I don\u2019t think that our customer will be disappointed with that. We build things that are transformative that are so different than others. So I would be excited for the second half if I would be you. It\u2019s crunch time for Verizon. We have been talking about this for one and a half year. I think our customers will be very excited in the second half. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So, David to your question around equipment volume, certainly we saw in June an improvement in the volumes across both consumer and business on the wireless side, but I don\u2019t expect that to have a material impact on volumes in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And it\u2019s largely because of the way we do the accounting now being on the device payment plan model. So you have \u2013 if you get that increase in equipment revenue, you also get kind of very similar increase on the expense side and even any higher commissions and so on under 606 now get recognized over the expected life of that customer. So the increase in volumes should not be causing a significant change in the margin, a hit to the margin there that as you phrased it in the question. One area where the volumes do maybe have an EPS or EBITDA impact is in especially enterprise and public sector where you still have some of those sales on a subsidy model. But overall, the vast majority of our wireless business is now on device payment, and then you get a much closer matching of the revenues and the expenses. So I\u2019m not expecting to see a significant headwind to the EBITDA in 3Q as volumes pick up.\nDavid Barden: Great. Thank you so much, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Dave. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Yes, thanks for taking the question and I was hoping we could just follow up again on the outlook for improving wireless service revenue growth in the third quarter. It sounds like from your comments you\u2019re not expecting any further pressures from fees and usage-based revenues. And so I was hoping you could talk about what\u2019s going on with the mix at an ARPA level? Are you seeing customers continuing upgrading to unlimited plans or has that slowed? And really what\u2019s your outlook for what that pace of upgrading is going to be? And then you did talk about the efforts you\u2019re making to help customers who have had payment issues. Can you give us any update on the number of accounts who are in some type of patient program? And I think the thing most people are really interested in is how many customers had fully stopped making payment at this point in time and what are your assumptions about how you\u2019re going to manage that base in the third quarter as you structure that outlook? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Matt, I think you\u2019re on mute.\nMatt Ellis: There we go. I forgot to come off mute. Brett, thanks for the question. As you think around service revenue, it starts with having more customers as we come into the third quarter than the second quarter. You saw 173,000 adds in the quarter and especially the 97,000 in consumer and adding accounts. So that\u2019s obviously going to help us sequentially with billing those customers. You mentioned some of the fees, we\u2019ll see how those play out, but certainly that will be a factor. The usage from a roaming standpoint, we don\u2019t expect to see that get sequentially better as a large part of our roaming revenue is international and we don\u2019t expect either business or personal travel to be at the levels this year it was last year for some time. So all of those things will play into service revenue being up sequentially, but it starts from increasing the base of our customers as we\u2019ve done for a long time now and that will continue to be the largest driver. We still have the ability to upgrade customers to unlimited. We made further progress on doing that during the course of the quarter and now well over 50% of our base on unlimited. There\u2019s still opportunity to step more customers up there as we go forward. Pivoting to your questions around the customer payment and where we are with Keep Americans Connected pledge, obviously that pledge ended as of June 30. We ended at around 1.5 million accounts, so it was right in line with our expectations 90 days ago. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s most encouraging though is what we\u2019re seeing in terms of payment patterns from the customers. We have approximately a third of the customers are current as of the end of June. I\u2019ve said in the comments that the vast majority have made some payments during that time period. More than 80% of those wireless customers who took the pledge have been making payments. So I am very, very encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen. My expectation is the vast majority of these customers will be customers of ours a year from now.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thank you for that.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brett. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, guys. First, following up on that last comment, Matt. So have you contacted everyone at this point as you\u2019ve gone through July? And I believe you\u2019re on service 60-day cutoff cycle at this point, so you would know by September 1, give or take, who of the pledges is going to come out or not? And then for Hans, can you talk about sort of CapEx priorities and maybe how things might shift over the next year, assuming you get more mid-band spectrum? I know you can\u2019t talk too much about spectrum, but how may capital spending shift there? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Hi, Phi. Thank you for the questions. I\u2019ll go first on the follow-up question, then Hans can answer CapEx. So here\u2019s what we did at the end of the quarter. For those customers who weren\u2019t current \u2013 as I mentioned, more than a third of them were current. So we saw that customers want to continue to pay for the service they get from us. We have a well established process for customers who late pay. We do this every day. We\u2019ve done it for years. But what we did for these customers in the Keep American Connected pledge, we rolled them into a program that took whatever balance they had built up at the end of the pledge and put it to be paid off over a number of months, and so we\u2019ve applied that to them. As you said, because of the billing cycle and so on, we won\u2019t get to see where they are here for another few weeks. We\u2019re watching that closely. But as I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve seen obviously an intent for these customers to continue to pay. We have a great track record of working with customers. And when they have difficult personal circumstances, helping them to get back current over time and allowing them to remain customers and I expect nothing different with this group of customers in this situation.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. And about the CapEx, I\u2019m just looking back at three years that I have been at Verizon, even though the overall absolute number of CapEx has been very stable, what is inside has dramatically changed all the time, because we together with our engineering team is all the time doing the right priorities given the assets we have. One year ago, we didn\u2019t talk about DSS. But of course, our team was working to prepare all the networks so we can actually deploy DSS in all the radio base stations we have. So we constantly are ahead of the game thinking what is needed to be preparing for the network. But right now our focus is very much about the commitments we have to our customers when it comes to 5G, but also to keeping the best network on 4G. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll have it and then do that fiber reach. Those are the priorities and it will continue so. Then any speculation on the future spectrum or something, that\u2019s a little bit early to have right now. But I can tell you my team is always proactively thinking about how to do this network continue to be the best in America. There\u2019s no debate about that. And I have a high confidence that they will continue to do so when it comes to our CapEx allocation as well.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Phil. Okay. Angela, I think we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe a question about wireless competition. Obviously T-Mobile just did some refreshing of their low-end pricing. Do you guys see this as sort of something new or aggressive or is it just sort of regular course of business? And then as we look out into the second half and obviously the industry\u2019s been talking about 5G for a while, we sort of had some pent-up demand given the low upgrades. Do you guys see the launch of the 5G iPhone, which looks like it\u2019s been kicked out into the fourth quarter, as a sort of big event for the industry and one where similar to what happened with the LTE iPhone an opportunity for Verizon to take share? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, John. First of all, I think we\u2019re as prepared as we can be. We have prepared ourselves with our models when it comes to Mix and Match on the consumer side. We have taken out course. We have the best network. I feel very good about the competition. We have always had competition. This is nothing new. So I think Ronan and the team, because that\u2019s primarily where I guess your question is related to. So I think they are well prepared. And as I said, I\u2019m really excited for our second half and what we are doing right now and we are prepared for it. And when it comes to 5G phone from Apple, I can comment on that, but of course it\u2019s a big event whenever it comes because the U.S. market has a very high penetration on iOS. And of course, customers are reluctant to change between the different operating systems. So that\u2019s why a 5G phone from Apple isn\u2019t very important event and especially if you have built the network like us where it\u2019s so transformative that so many customers will be able to feel that transformation and that difference in usage of the network compared to some other networks that will not be a big difference. So I\u2019m excited. I think Ronan is super excited for going into second half and compete. And we have been prepared for this for years and we have been doing it for years.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, Hans.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, John. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins: Hi. Good morning and thanks. Two, if I could. First, as you\u2019ve done more with service bundling with things like Disney+, can you share some of the results of customers entering into those bundles and how it\u2019s affecting the economics of your customers? And second, if I go back to when you talked about 5G in the past, you outlined some timeframes of when you thought there would be material financial contributions to the consumer and business segments. And as we\u2019re getting closer to those points in time, I was curious if you can give us an update on where that stands and maybe some examples of the way that you\u2019re anticipating getting that monetization in each of the consumer and business segments? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Michael. Good questions. On the first one, on the bundling we are doing, I think this is a key differentiator for us. What we have been able to do in partnership with the greatest brands that we have on earth and combining that with the best network, the best brand and our distribution. And as I said several times before, our metrics has proven to be far better than we even initially thought, meaning how many have taken the premium from the beginning and how many were converting to paying customers. But not only that, it tells you a difference when you start comparing to competition. What do you get when you work with Verizon? You get not only the best network, you get some of the best services that are running at the moment. And I think that\u2019s unique for us and that\u2019s why if you look at our churn numbers, we are at record low. I think that hangs together for us and we will continue to do so. But we are very picky who we are using. It has to be the right brands. It has to be addressing our full customer base that they really appreciate it. So again, the Verizon Consumer Group with the lead of Ronan and all his team, they are working with it daily. And I would say, we have many services that want to join us because they have seen the model panning out in a very good fashion. The examples you\u2019re mentioning, Disney+ or Apple Music, both of them have I would say have been very successful for both parties and that\u2019s how we see it. On the 5G, when it comes to our commitments and what we outlined when it comes to our revenues, we have not changed. Those are the same. We are gearing for so-called the consumer part of it, Home and mobility in '21 to see some revenues from there and then in '22 from the 5G Mobile Edge Compute. But you\u2019re going to see much more sort of milestones right now of customers, sites and all the early indicators of that we\u2019re heading into that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to provide you with. You see that now we are preparing for that with announcement. If you think about the Mobile Edge Compute, just last week we announced partnership with IBM and with SAP. That\u2019s going to be part of the 5G Mobile Edge Compute in order to serve our customers. So you\u2019re going to see that how we are doing, sort of laying out early indicators on that path to revenue that we have outlined both internally as well as externally.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Hans, I want to stay with the same theme as the last few questions where we talk about 5G. You\u2019ve talked a lot about Mobile Edge Compute. But I wonder if you could just sort of \u2013 two things. First, drill down a little bit into the actual use cases for 5G that you are seeing from your \u2013 particularly business customers that you think are starting to materialize? And then just \u2013 I wonder if you could just talk about the health of your customers, and I think in particular about municipalities and cities and towns for some of those applications where budgets are now very perilous, but even large enterprises where they\u2019re seeing big downturns because of the recession and how much that really affects the likely uptake of 5G in terms of timelines?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. Good questions. Let me start at the last question. I\u2019ll come back to the others. When we see the customers, I think that first of all, when it comes to our governmental business, as you have seen, that has been really going well for the last few quarters here in the pandemic. Many of these states, municipalities, of course, need to go to new models of delivering services to the students or to the community at large. And that\u2019s why we have seen \u2013 we announced yesterday several different states that are now using our services for remote learning, for example. So, there we see that there is a craving for actually go to digitalization. That\u2019s the only way and that\u2019s not a one-time thing. For me, I think it\u2019s the new normal. We\u2019re going to see that going over. So I\u2019m really encouraged about that and our strength working with these customers. Then, of course, there are some advanced customers. You also heard this week, we together with the Defense Department are now doing 5G tests, et cetera. So they are also both advanced, but also \u2013 so there I feel really good. We have a really good go-to-market. We have great networks, which is the main thing here. Then on the enterprise side, you\u2019re absolutely right. Here you see a divider. Of course, the travel enterprises, the airlines companies, the restaurant large enterprises, they of course are in furlough and actually trying to reduce the costs as much as possible. But on the other hand, you have the large enterprises and actually see the change \u2013 see the opportunity right now to transform. I probably do five to seven large enterprises executive meetings per week right now discussing how to do the digitalization of these enterprises. And many of them are accelerating the plans rather than delaying them. Then, of course, we know that lot of infrastructure is already in place for these enterprises, still it takes time to do it. And this can be SD-WANs, video conferencing, fiber or whatever. So it\u2019s more things we sell today. Then you come to the 5G Mobile Edge Compute. I think that the use cases we see today is very much real-time decision-making. If that\u2019s a big distribution center that\u2019s going to have 5G-enabled distribution center to actually take real-time decisions, or if it\u2019s a big manufacturing plant that\u2019s going to use 5G Mobile Edge Compute by wireless connecting to all the robotics, we\u2019re in many of those cases. And then you also see cases where sort of IoT devices with 5G will actually enable a new way of delivering a service. And finally, the whole VR and AR for large enterprises where you need a low latency on the campus or in the manufacturing or whatever it might be, those are all the early cases. Many of them right now are based on low latency. We see it\u2019s creeping into security because the data can then be contained with the company, meaning they can actually process and have all the processing and storage at the edge, which means they can keep the data for themselves. So those two capabilities are the first one. I think in the next, we\u2019re going to see enormous bandwidth of enterprise that need to send a lot of data to the edge in order to take decisions. But so far, latency and security, that\u2019s how the 5G Mobile Edge Compute scenarios are working out. And we basically have two, three \u2013 or two, I would say, per industry vertical that are lead customers for us. And we work with them to do the solutions and sometimes we are the third party as we don\u2019t have all application ourselves. That\u2019s how we\u2019re working it right now and I\u2019m encouraged. And, of course, as I said before, acceleration has been seen, because all the digitalization and touchless that is needed going forward.\nCraig Moffett: That\u2019s great. Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Craig. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McCormack of Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael McCormack: Hi. Thanks, guys. Hans, maybe just a quick comment again on the enterprise side. So it sounds like you\u2019re not seeing any sort of delayed decision-making contracts that have been in process or still going through. And then secondly, one of your competitors was talking about 5G as a home broadband replacement not really being such a great replacement. Any thoughts around that? And then I guess does that change any of your view on the importance of Fios going forward? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: On the enterprise, to some extent you\u2019re right, because certain customers are delaying and not doing decisions. Those are usually in industries that has huge impact from COVID-19. That\u2019s extremely clear. But we work with them anyhow, because ultimately they are going to be our customers when these come out and those industries will flourish. So we are resilient. We support our customers in good and bad times and our business model is actually working in good and bad times, which is really, really good. So that\u2019s working. The comments on 5G Home from people that are not really doing it, of course, I cannot even comment on that. We feel really good about our model. As we have said before, minimum of 10 5G Home cities. We\u2019re going to have the cities with a much better chipset. That\u2019s on plan for this second half. So, again, we feel good about \u2013 our learnings are deep on building coverage, throughputs and all of that. And the self-install, which I have been talking about now for one and half year, which excites me that our customers should be able to receive the gear, the CPs and be able to install themselves in a short timeframe. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m down to the times that I have envisioned. I wanted to be below one hour, but we have come a far way from the eight hours we started with. And compared to a fiber installation where you need to first put it on the agenda, you wait for a couple of weeks and you have to come there and install it, and it takes hours to do. This is a totally different way. It\u2019s transformative. As I said, we are building 5G that\u2019s transformative, not the me-too to my 4G.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Mike. And special shout out to Mike today. So I heard it\u2019s his birthday. So happy birthday, Mike.\nMichael McCormack: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Supino: Hi. Thank you. On 5G Home, I\u2019m wondering as you look out at the arrival of the high-powered CPE, which I think comes in Q4, what the key unanswered questions are for you in terms of performance and unit economics that would allow you to speak a bit more clearly about expectations? And I\u2019m curious whether you think it can scale in 2021? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I think we\u2019ve answered the majority of the questions when it comes to how we can scale. There are always things. We are at the forefront on technology. We\u2019re first in the world doing this and there is no one even close of thinking it like this. So, of course, there are challenges. We, as an executive team, we sit down once a month, the whole executive team reviewing all this with our engineers to be better all the way from the installation to the marketing. So I feel that we have a good plan. Of course, there are still things outstanding and we can do better over time, but I think we\u2019re in a good place to re-launch when the more powerful CPE is coming, that\u2019s what \u2013 and that should enable us to go into 2021 with a better understanding of how we can scale it and where we will scale it. I think one thing that we have learned also is that, of course, fixed wireless access, we think a lot about consumers, but there is an opportunity clearly when you see this also as a fixed wireless access opportunity for small and medium business, et cetera, that we will start working on later on.\nMatt Ellis: Hi, Peter. It\u2019s Matt. Just a couple of thoughts. One, remember, you\u2019re driving these revenues off of the same network that you are getting 5G mobility revenues on. So this is the first time we\u2019ve had that opportunity to drive multiple revenue streams off of the same investment. And so as we roll out the network, we\u2019ll have the opportunity to add more market share. And so we\u2019re very excited about that as we head into '21 with the progress we\u2019re making this year.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Angela, we have time for one more question. Let\u2019s do one more from the audience here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. I had two for Matt, if I can. One, just given the various moving parts as it relates to free cash flow and some of the bigger benefits you saw in the second quarter that were one-time, I was wondering if you can give some color on what free cash flow could look like for the back half of the year or more simplistically, whether or not you expect free cash flow in 2020 to be above or below that of 2019? And then secondly, as it relates to the upcoming C-band auction, which I know you\u2019re not going to talk too much about, but when you think about how you\u2019re going to finance that, do you think that that point you\u2019ll have enough as it relates to cash on hand and room within your debt financing to pay for what you will ultimately spend at that auction, or do you think that there could be a point where you might have to curtail at least temporarily your level of investment just to ensure that you\u2019re able to get the most out of that auction that you\u2019d want to? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks, Colby. So in regards to the last question, we\u2019re certainly excited about the opportunities that come with the C-band auction. One of the great things about having got the balance sheet in position that we have is it gives us the opportunity to take advantage of items like that when they come along. And I don\u2019t think that \u2013 as I look at the balance sheet and I look at the auction that that will provide any inhibitor [ph] to us either in terms of what we do in the auction or how we invest in the rest of the business. In terms of the free cash flow, so the second quarter as you say, a couple of items in there. We had the tax benefit from the item that we recognized in the fourth quarter last year. We also had a timing difference of about $2 billion moving just regular cash payments from second quarter to last week. But all-in-all, look, our cash flow will continue to be strong because we have \u2013 obviously we have a strong business with a recurring revenue stream that will continue into the second half of the year. Working capital provided a benefit in the first half with the lower volumes. We\u2019ll see how that plays out in the second half of the year. And I think that will be one of the key determinants of how cash flow looks for the full year on a year-over-year basis. So we\u2019ll see how it plays out, but I certainly expect free cash flow to continue to be strong for the business.\nColby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Colby. And with that, I think we\u2019re going to wrap up the call. And I just want to make sure everybody is safe and thank you for everything today. And Angela, back over to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and using Verizon Conference Services.

A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now, let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $1.4 billion, including a loss on spectrum licenses related to Auction 103 of $1.2 billion, and a net charge of $182 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liability. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.26 in the first quarter, up 5% compared to $1.20 a year ago. Let's now move to slide four and take a closer look at our first quarter earnings profile. We expect 2020 to be the final year that the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition will have a material year-over-year impact on our income statements. As we illustrated in previous quarters, we realized a lesser benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 during the first quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction of the benefit realized creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported and adjusted earnings per share, which will continue throughout 2020. The impact was $0.03 for the quarter. For full year 2020 we expect headwinds from the deferral of commission expense to be approximately $0.09. We estimate there was a negative $0.04 net impact included in the reported and adjusted EPS from COVID during the quarter. Matt will go through this in more detail later. Adjusted EPS growth of 5% over the prior year illustrated on the earnings waterfall slide reflects the strong underlying performance of the business, partially offset by the impacts of the deferral of commission expense. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to walk you through a recap of the actions we have taken during this unprecedented time.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and most welcome to this earnings call. This is an earnings call that is very different from all previous ones that I have done. I've been in crisis -- in the telecom crisis in 2000, bank crisis in 2008 and 2009. This is something totally different. It's a health crisis with a pandemic that impacts each and every one of us wherever you are in this world. I'm proud of the team of Verizon, how we have been backing up in this crisis, and how we work together. We decided very early on to split our team in our crisis management team, and the leadership team continued to drive our business forward. In the middle of February, we made that split in order to see that we're actually attending all the things that\u2019s happening in a company the size of Verizon. Our COVID-19 response has been based on how we manage our four stakeholders. We have taken decisive action, but they're all balanced and thinking about the long-term and the positive impact for all our stakeholders. Let me quickly go over what we have done in different areas of stakeholders. On the employee side, the majority of all our employees are working from home. We moved quickly to a work-from-home environment. Today, we have high productivity in that setup. We have also retrained some 20,000 of our own employees to work with new tasks and work from home, and some additional 1,000 of third parties that is part of our delivery. But we also need to acknowledge we have a lot of our employees in frontline, serving customers, keeping up the networks at the same time as keeping some of our stores open. We have roughly 30% of our stores open, of course, with limited opening times and also only by appointment. But they are playing a vital role to keep up the most important infrastructure in this country right now besides hospitals and first responders, and I'm happy to report the team is doing a great job. And talking about our customers, we have been attending all our customers with new demands during this crisis. At the same time, we are also part of the pledge of Keep Americans Connected, which means that we are waiving late fees or overages for small and medium businesses and the residential customers that have been impacted by the coronavirus. Our network has performed well. I will come back to that a little bit later. When it comes to our work in the society, helping communities, that's also extremely important right now. Large corporations need to take the responsibility. We have done some of it like the PayItForward, which is our concert side, sometimes three times a week which is gathering concerts or celebrities, bringing in people actually adding to and helping small and medium businesses. We call it PayItForwardLIVE. But also work with WHO and other organization that needs help and ultimately supporting the most vulnerable in our society. Finally, on the education side that we always have been focused on, we're not only supporting the schools that had already had their support for, but we're also adding together New York Times offering all the content from New York Times to all the high school students across the country. So, we're proud what we're doing in that area. And finally on the financials, we have also worked quite a lot with what we're doing in our cost side. We're taking already cost measurements in the first quarter, everything from third-party spending, seeing of course that we're traveling less but we're doing this prudently as usual. On top of that, we increased the CapEx guidance in the quarter because we felt that it was a good time for us to continue to see that we have robust networks as we went into a moment in time we don't really know how the network would be used. At the same time, of course sending a message that we think is a good return on investment on that incremental CapEx. At the same time, I think, Matt and his team have done a great job of seeing that our balance sheet is in the best shape, added liquidity in the middle of the quarter through very cost-effective bond costs that we had. And we are also working with scenario planning. Nobody really knows how this is going to end, but we have several scenarios and actions that we're working with as a leadership team. Let me talk about the network a little bit, and we have been reporting every week the development of our network since the outbreak of the pandemic. And you are seeing some staggering numbers like over 200% up on gaming, 10 times up on collaboration tools, 40% up on video. 800 million calls a day, which is twice the amount of what we have on Mother's Day which is the biggest day a year. All that we have been managing very well with the network. We have built a robust network and we can deliver high quality. If we then look now week-to-week, you can see on the slide that we have much less of changes. We feel that we have settled in on the type of usage of the network and where it's used. So it's very small variation. I just want to point out the mobile handoffs, which is basically how our customers are moving between different cells down 35% since the outbreak of the COVID-19. And in certain places like New York City it's over 50% reductions on mobile handoff. So how our network hold up then when it comes to all those changes? This is how we show during the Investor Day the -- how our capacity versus the busy hours in the wireless network. As you can see we continue to keep the same headroom in the network when we come into the COVID-19. And the main reason is that, first of all, we were prepared. We have added capacity. But also the network is using different time frames and with different applications. And this exclude any use of the AWS-3 temporary spectrum that SEC so greatly lended to us in the beginning of this crisis as an insurance if usage would go somewhere we wouldn't know. But however, I can report that our technicians and our operations team has done a fantastic job and the network is keeping up very well with the changes and the enormous usage of the network. Let me finish up before I hand over to Matt and talking about the progress towards our 2020 commitment. They are intact. We work to see that we can both handle this crisis, which is unprecedented, but we also continue to execute on our strategy. When it comes to strengthen our core business and grow our core business of course we right now have more digital sales than we had before which is of course very encouraging. But we also strengthened our core business by adding a very good and nice piece of millimeter wave spectrum that gives us very good holdings for four to five strategy. When it comes to leverage our assets and we're growing in the future our 5G plans and our fiber plans the build out of that are on plan. We were also a little bit ahead of plan when we ended the first quarter. And can I report still today we are on plan with the 5G and fiber. Of course, our challenge is out there when it comes to COVID-19 and so on. But our team are finding new ways and innovative ways to actually do the deployment. There are ways of dealing with approvals from the municipalities set by new ways. And we have great collaborations from many of the municipalities to do it. There might be problems going forward but I am also confident that my team are very innovative in the field and see that we continue to drive hard on this. We also added an acquisition just recently the BlueJeans acquisition, adding to what Matt and I said in the fourth quarter talking about the investment we want to do in our Verizon Business Group where we see great opportunity and, of course, then accentuated in this COVID-19 where we now add the BlueJeans capabilities both to our existing distribution, but also for the future of 5G where we think there are video capabilities that's going to be extremely important. On the financial discipline we continue to drive that. Matt is leading that work both preplanning and what we're doing. And finally about our purpose-driven company, which is so important this time to see that you have all your employees with you. We are doing a lot of impact in the society. We have virtual volunteering right now where a lot of our employees can actually contribute to the society in these tough times. And finally, we also actually communicate with our employees basically every day on a live webcast in order to see that everyone knows what we're doing and where we're going in times of uncertainty. Quickly on the first quarter, Matt will cover it much better. I'm proud of the team delivering strong growth in wireless service revenue, but also the 5% growth on our adjusted earnings, which includes impact of COVID-19 and then a strong cash flow up 26% year-over-year. The segments all had their challenges, but also their strength in this quarter. Mainly, the challenges come from COVID-19. Finally on the guidance, we decided to continue to do certain guidance even there are certain un-clarities in the market and of the future. We decided that revenue we will not guide on the revenue, because the hardware is so hard to predict at this moment. But we actually are guiding on EPS and continue with all other items as well. And Matt will go through that in detail, but always with the understanding that we don't have all the knowledge what will going to happen. We may need to make assumptions about it. By that, I hand it over to Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. As Hans discussed, we are in an unprecedented time. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the various measures taken to address the emergency, we experienced starkly different trends during the first two and half months of the first quarter than we did during the last few weeks. We understand that most of you are more interested in what we are currently seeing in the business, so I'll go through the quarterly results at a high level and spend more time addressing the most recent trends and how they impact our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. We will begin with a review of our consolidated operating and financial results. In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $31.6 billion, down 1.6%. Growth in wireless service revenue in both the Consumer and Business segments was offset by sharp reductions in equipment revenue. Consolidated wireless equipment revenue was down over 16% in the first quarter driven by the Consumer segment, primarily as a result of the limited in-store customer engagement in March, due to COVID. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion, down slightly from last year, including the impact from COVID. Low wireless volumes in Consumer Group drove benefits to margins through decreased promotional spend lower equipment revenue and improved churn. These benefits were more than offset by higher bad debt expense, lower advertising revenues from Verizon Media Group in March and customer actions that resulted in a decrease in wireless fees and non-recurring usage charges. Our incremental bad debt reserve of $228 million was the largest component of these items. The headwinds from the deferral of commission expense that Brady highlighted earlier reduced EBITDA by $172 million, which is an impact of approximately 55 basis points to EBITDA margin in the quarter. We have continued to focus on our Business Excellence program with the goal to realize $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by the end of 2021, and have saved $6.3 billion through the end of the first quarter. The activities of this program over the past two years have put us in a position to be more agile and adaptive in uncertain times like these. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $1.26, up 5.0% from $1.20 a year ago. This included an estimated net impact from COVID of approximately $0.04, primarily driven by an increase of our bad debt reserve. Let's now turn to our segment results starting with Consumer Group on slide 10. Our Consumer team continues to deliver best-in-class services to our customers, while keeping them connected in their personal and work communities. We are extremely proud of the team's performance particularly our frontline workers' efforts to meet our customers' needs during this very difficult period. Our Consumer segment started the year with typical low seasonal volumes during the first quarter. In March, customer transaction activity slowed significantly, due to shelter-in-place policies, travel restrictions and other measures taken to promote social distancing. Later in the call, I will go into a deeper discussion on the exit rate trends as we serve our customers in this new environment. First quarter phone gross adds were down nearly 13% year-over-year and postpaid phone net losses were just over 300,000 for the quarter. Phone churn performance was solid throughout the quarter at 0.77%, which was down four basis points from a year ago. Consistent with first quarter seasonal volume activity and the impact of COVID our retail postpaid upgrade rate remained low during the quarter and is one of the key contributing factors to the decline in wireless equipment revenue. We expect this trend to continue for as long as social distancing policies and other safety measures to protect our employees and customers continue to limit store traffic. Fios Internet net additions of 59,000 were up sequentially and year-over-year, as work from home in-home schooling and other related measures increased the utility and demand for our high-quality broadband offerings. Fios video net losses accelerated for the quarter, and we expect cord cutting trends to continue. In order to ensure the safety of our customers and employees, while providing critical network services, we have modified our approach over the past few weeks and are not currently entering customer locations except for critical functions. Now, let's move to slide 11 to discuss the Consumer financial performance. Our Consumer segment entered 2020 with strong momentum, as we added a significant number of wireless connections towards the end of 2019, which favorably impacted the first quarter. For our Fios consumer products, we launched new Mix & Match pricing early in the quarter, providing price transparency and choice in our broadband and video offerings. We also introduced Yahoo Mobile to expand our wireless offerings across our digital media customer base. We continue to generate strong service revenue and other revenue growth. But this was more than offset by a significant decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to low volume activity. Consumer segment total revenue was down 1.7% year-over-year. The growth in unlimited plans increase in connections per account and high demand for our broadband services in the quarter drove strong profitability for the segment, offset by an increase in bad debt expense as a result of COVID impacts. Consumer EBITDA margin of 46.4% was up 60 basis points over the prior year and included approximately 80 basis points of headwind from the deferral of commission expense. Lower equipment revenue had a limited impact on our overall EBITDA performance. Now let's move to slide 12 to review the Business Group results. During a time when connectivity is providing critical support to those impacted by this crisis, our Business team is at the forefront to serve our enterprise, small and medium business, public sector and wholesale customers. We remain an outstanding partner for first responders, healthcare providers and other frontline workers. And as Hans mentioned, we are extremely proud of our team's work to deliver essential services to our customers so they can serve others. Business trends were strong throughout the quarter, and we saw heightened demand for our products and services in March. Businesses need our services now more than ever as we saw strong demand for mobility, Jetpacks, VPN services and high-speed circuit capacity in the first quarter. As you look at the detail on the slide for wireless products, you can see phone gross adds were up 25% from the prior year driven by strength in global enterprise and public sector with offsetting pressure in small and medium business. This contributed to postpaid phone net adds of 239,000 and total postpaid net adds of 475,000. Business segment phone churn of 1.02% in the quarter was flat year-over-year driven by strength in public sector with offsetting pressure in small and medium business. Let's now move to slide 13 to review the business financial performance. Operating revenues for the Business segment in the first quarter were down approximately 0.5% from the prior year. Wireless revenues within enterprise SMB and public sector were up year-over-year driven by strong wireless service revenue growth of 6.9%. This was offset by legacy wireline and wholesale revenue declines. We are encouraged by the business EBITDA performance in the first quarter, which was driven by tight controls around spending and strong wireless performance as we generated solid profitability even with higher than usual volumes and the ongoing transformation investments in the segment for future growth. Now let's move on to slide 14 to discuss Verizon Media Group. During the first quarter, Verizon Media Group's performance was impacted by COVID similar to others in the digital advertising and search business. Total revenue is $1.7 billion, down 4% compared to last year, driven almost entirely by COVID impacts. Prior to COVID, our year-over-year revenue trends were continuing the steady improvement seen in 2019. We are seeing increased levels of customer engagement across our platforms. But advertising rates and search revenue have declined in the current environment. Verizon Media launched a coronavirus hub on Yahoo! News and Yahoo! Finance and COVID-19's newsletter through Yahoo Mail, both of which are driving significant customer engagement as we aim to keep users informed on what is happening in their area and around the globe with trusted content. Let's now move to slide 15 for a quick look at the overall wireless performance. Slide 15 shows the key metrics and financial data of the combined wireless products and services from the Consumer and Business segment for the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue grew 1.9% over the prior year. Additional details are provided in the financial and operating information and our supplemental earnings release's schedules on our website. Now let's review our cash flow and balance sheet for the quarter on slide 16. Cash flow from operating activities was $8.8 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from the prior year. This year-over-year growth was partially driven by Voluntary Separation Program payments and the voluntary pension contributions in the first quarter of 2019 that did not repeat this year as well as working capital improvements from our operations this quarter. Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $5.3 billion, which is up approximately $1 billion year-over-year. We expect the timing of capital spending to be more front-end loaded than it was last year. Our capital expenditures continue to support capacity for unprecedented traffic growth across our networks while we continue to deploy more fiber and add additional cell sites to support our 5G rollout. As we mentioned earlier in March, we increased our full year 2020 CapEx guidance to $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion in order to facilitate Verizon's network activity and help support the economy during this period of disruption. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.6 billion, which was up 26.2% year-over-year and continues to fund our dividend. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with very low unsecured bond maturities through the end of 2021. Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.1 times, up slightly from year-end. Let's move on to slide 17 to take a deeper look at the trends we have seen in the last half of March and into early April. During the month of March as COVID safety measures were implemented with new federal and state recommendations for social distancing, our retail consumer and small business activity diminished significantly. By the middle of March, we saw a dramatic shift in customer behavior as stores closed and other business activity halted across the country. At the same time, we experienced increased demand from our public sector and some large enterprise customers to support frontline crisis responders, new work from home and home schooling arrangements and other demands for critical connectivity services. This slide provides selected metrics from March 15 through April 15 and offers a more in-depth view of the early impacts of the current COVID environment. At this point it is unclear how long these trends will continue. In our Consumer Group we closed nearly 70% of our company-operated retail stores and reduced in-store services throughout the day for social distancing safety measures. As you can see on this slide we experienced a significant drop in customer activity and device volumes during this period. Consumer wireless gross adds declined nearly 50% from the same period in the prior year and upgrades declined over 40%. As expected lower customer switching across the entire industry has led to a significant improvement in phone churn. As part of the industry's effort to help customers we signed the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge in March and will waive any late fees and keep customers connected in the event of nonpayment due to the pandemic for the period of the pledge. We have added 15 gigabits of data to metered consumers and small business plans and also to hotspot usage for unlimited plans. This additional data along with increased in-home WiFi usage has resulted in lower data overage revenue in the quarter. In addition to these customer-focused actions and impacts consumer behavior has changed dramatically over this short time period such as reduced international roaming revenue. In order to keep our employees and customers safe through social distancing, we are generally not performing installations for consumer Fios when work inside the home would be required. Gross adds are currently limited to those that can be performed directly by the customer or with the technician working outside the home. In our Business group, we have broken out the trends for our small and medium business customer group showing the drop-off that we have seen in gross adds and upgrades as a major portion of small businesses have seen a steep reduction in activities and in many cases a full shutdown. In contrast to Consumer we are not seeing the same improvement in churn at this time. For public sector and some global enterprise customers, we have seen an increased demand for remote connectivity solutions as a greater number of people are working and schooling from home. Wireless gross adds for these customers were up 163% over the similar period in the prior year, mostly driven by demand for phones, Jetpacks and other connected devices. Our network superiority and long-standing relationship with enterprises first responders and other workers in the fronts has given us the ability to support their connectivity needs across the country when they need Verizon most. In addition to the increase in gross adds activity, we have seen an improvement in retention for our enterprise and public sector customers with phone churn improving by 35 basis points during this period. We are working with all of our customers during this time to ensure they stay connected even if they're experiencing financial hardship as a result of COVID. We believe that our enterprise, public sector and wholesale customers will be relatively less impacted than our SMB customers initially, but we may see increased long-term risk from the crisis. Wireless service revenues in our Business Group are being impacted by reductions in overage fees, a reduction in international roaming and an increase in suspension of lines. Across Consumer and Business, we believe total wireless service revenue growth to be 3 to 5 percentage points lower than originally expected in the second quarter as a result of the reduction in fees and usage-based revenues. Additionally, bad debt expense increased as a result of our changing expectations around customer payments during this time. In the first quarter, we increased our bad debt reserve by $228 million based on the expected number of customers who will avail themselves of payment relief under the Keep Americans Connected Pledge. We will continue to monitor Consumer and Business payment behavior and we'll work with our customers to help them stay connected despite difficult circumstances. As a result it is possible that additional bad debt reserves may be required in the second quarter. In Verizon Media, we are experiencing a decline in advertising and search revenue as advertisers pause, hold back or cancel campaigns during this time and users are searching for fewer commercial terms providing us with less opportunity for monetization. As a result, advertising revenues declined by nearly 10% in the month of March with COVID mostly impact in the second half of the month and that rate of decline has increased in April. A number of industry forecasts expect a 20% to 30% decline in digital media revenues in 2Q and Verizon Media's results are likely to be similar to those experienced in the broader industry. Now let's go to Slide 18 to discuss our guidance and outlook for 2020. Obviously, the environment we find ourselves in today is vastly different than when we originally gave guidance just a few months ago. Given the unprecedented magnitude of the conditions we have all experienced, we are updating our financial guidance for the full year. We remain confident in our strategy our business model and our ability to generate sustainable long-term earnings growth. Our consolidated revenue guidance of low to mid-single-digit percent growth that we announced in January included the expectation that 2020 equipment revenues would not create similar year-over-year headwinds as it has in the past few years. However, device activations have been low since mid-March and we expect that to continue throughout the second quarter with uncertainty around customer behavior for the remainder of the year. The wide range of potential outcomes around equipment revenue led us to determine that it is prudent to withdraw our consolidated revenue guidance at this time. For adjusted EPS, we are revising our original guidance of 2% to 4% growth and are now guiding to a range of negative 2% to positive 2% change from the prior year. Our new estimated range is based on a scenario that assumes significant headwinds prevail throughout the second quarter. We have limited visibility into the second half of the year, which will depend on various potential operating environments. We will continue to assess the impact of COVID on our business, including our bad debt reserve and expect to provide an update on our next earnings call based on how things develop between now and then. Other income statement items for which we provided guidance including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the adjusted effective tax rate remain intact as originally guided. As we mentioned earlier, we have maintained our CapEx guidance for the full year that we announced in March. Our supply chain remains strong and we have not seen a material slowdown in the sourcing of necessary equipment from our network and device partners. We are optimistic that the measures government agencies have taken will provide support to citizens, businesses and the frontline responders that have been impacted by this crisis. We remain keenly focused on doing our part to provide best-in-class network performance and customer experience to all of our customers, which will continue to drive long-term operational and financial success, while weathering short-term disruptions. Despite the extreme nature of what the world is experiencing, we believe that Verizon is well suited to remain resilient through this situation. Let's take a look at slide 19 to discuss our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Over the past few years, we have strengthened our balance sheet and the results of those actions have put us in a good position to manage through the impacts of the COVID pandemic. We ended the first quarter with $7 billion of cash on hand. Carrying a higher cash balance during a market crisis is part of our liquidity planning strategy and we executed on that strategy with a $3.5 billion bond offering completed in March. In addition, we started and ended the first quarter with no commercial paper outstanding, but have accessed this market in the second quarter to further enhance our liquidity. During the first quarter and before the market disruption we also completed one of our largest device payment securitizations of $1.6 billion. Having a cash cushion is prudent right now for many reasons, including our expectation that certain customers may have difficulty making timely payments as a result of the crisis. We are closely monitoring these trends, with regard to their impact on our ABS programs. In the second quarter, we had some nonrecurring cash outflows including $2.7 billion of maturities and $1.3 billion of spectrum licenses from Auction 103. Scheduled unsecured bond maturities for the rest of 2020 are zero as a result of our continued liability management strategy that keep near-term maturities low. Additionally, at the end of 2019, given our funded status and prior discretionary contributions, we expect no mandatory contributions to our pension plan until 2026 subject to market conditions. Our pension funded status has been further protected in recent years as we have increased the hedge ratio of our liability to about 50%. This resulted in the funded status of our pension plan only declining from 92% at year-end to 87% at the end of first quarter. Our standby credit facility with our bank group of $9.5 billion provides further assurance of our liquidity. Our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity position has been further strengthened, as we navigate this difficult period for our customers and the markets. We have demonstrated the ability to access the bond and commercial paper markets in recent weeks. Our strong financial position gives us confidence to continue to invest, while also supporting all of our stakeholders. I'll turn it back over to Hans to provide a look at our 2020 priorities and then we'll get to your questions.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Let me just round this off with our priorities going into this year and in the future. First of all, I feel that we're very well positioned to execute both in the near term and the long-term to create more value for all our stakeholders. We have the Verizon 2.0 transformation, which is a new leadership, a new network technology, a new go-to-market, and we are delivering on that. And I feel that we have good results already right now, but more to come. I think we also have a very good strategy around the COVID-19 response that is covering all our stakeholders in a balanced way in order to create long-term value for all of them. The 5G is still very much in the middle the center of our strategy. And as you heard me saying before we're in the middle of the execution and we're not halting that. We're keeping it up all the time and the team is doing great work there. And we see opportunity with 5G going forward both with building all the cities, the 5G mobile edge compute as well as making this nationwide 5G still this year. Matt talked about our discipline and the financials and our capital position and our capital allocation, I feel good about that. We have done tremendous not in the last 12 months, but also the last three months in order to put us in a good situation to continue to meet all the demands in our capital allocation all the way from our business to our shareholders to our debt holders. And ultimately I think the strong brand that we have has been reinforced in times like that both by the talent we have but also by the response to our business practices and the way we're dealing with our society. So, all-in-all, I feel good about our strategy. I think that we are in the middle of execution of it. We need to have a multipronged strategy where we're managing the crisis at the same time, but that doesn't mean we should not execute on our strategy. So, by that, I hand it back to you Brady.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. A question about your updated EPS guidance. As you noted during your presentation, certain activity in the business has declined significantly. I would assume that there's a degree of cost savings associated with that. You also highlighted some areas where you're seeing some pressures. You highlighted roaming revenues as an example. So, I was hoping you can maybe just give us a little more insight into the puts and takes that caused you to see a slightly lower outlook for earnings over the course of the year. And then just point of clarification you said that this revised outlook reflects headwinds you expect to see in the second quarter. I'm curious whether you're saying that the variance in earnings that you expect to report this year will primarily be contained to the second quarter or if you're saying that those headwinds for the remainder of the year collectively resulting in a change? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Hey Brett thanks for the question, and good morning everyone. So, as you look at the guidance and we went through some of it in the prepared remarks. But as you look at the items that are in there, when I think about the revenue side for the second quarter, really break it up into two major buckets. You think about the actions that we've taken and the actions -- or the impacts of changes in customer behavior. So, as I start off and think about the actions we've taken, it starts with, obviously, the Keep Americans Connected Pledge for that 60-day period. The vast majority of that is in the second quarter and so we'll see more impact in Q2 than we saw in Q1. Additionally, as we mentioned, we've given customers an extra 15 gigabits of data, and whether that be on metered plans or on hotspots for those customers who are on unlimited plans. So, that's going to have a significant impact on the overage fees that we would normally collect. Earlier this week, we announced that we would be extending that 15 gigabit from the end of April through the end of May. On the customer behavior side, one of the obvious ones is obviously international roaming. I think it's fair to say you can put a pretty low number in your model for international roaming revenue for the second quarter. But also in there as we think around especially in the SMB side of the business, we would expect to see those customers suspending some of the lines on their accounts over this time period, and that will have an impact on revenue too. So, when we add all those things up, we see that those should impact the year-over-year service revenue growth in kind of the 3% to 5% range in Q2. Some of those things will obviously extend beyond Q2. Some of the things may not extend beyond Q2. Obviously, we control how much we extend the actions. The customer behavior will obviously be impacted by more of the macro environment, so we'll see how that plays out into the second half of the year. So, you have that there on the service revenue side. As you think about other parts of revenue, obviously equipment revenue will be down. But also within media, as I mentioned, we're seeing a significant reduction. We were down 4% for the first quarter but 10% in March. So, basically all of the year-over-year decline in the first quarter was contained in the COVID period. And then, as we've gone into the second quarter here, we're seeing those reductions increase. So, a lot of the industry forecast is 20% to 30% reduction of $1.7 billion of quarterly revenue, that's obviously a material number too. So, we have some benefits come through on the expense side, but obviously those revenue impacts are going to impact the overall profitability in the quarter and you see that reflected in our guide. In terms of the back half of the year, really too soon to tell. I mean there's a lot of things that play out here over the course of the next 90 days. We'll have a much better sense of what the back half of the year looks like. And then obviously, we'll update our view on that when we get to the next call. But we're optimistic. What we -- that's what we don't know. What we do know is we come into this situation in a position of strength. We've had good performance in the business over a number of quarters now. We come in with products and services that are obviously very important to customers, and we come in with a balance sheet that we've worked on significantly over the past few years. It gives us a little bit of a shock absorber if you will, so that we can keep operating our business and position ourselves to come out on the other end of this situation for a position of strength. So, that's how we're kind of seeing the second quarter and as we look forward to the rest of the year here Brett.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Brett. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Maybe just as a follow-up to Brett's question on that 300 to 500 basis points. Matt can you give us any more color in terms of maybe the sub-impact and the ARPU impact that you expect to see from all these different pieces? I mean, you gave some great detail on what's going on in April here, but maybe a sense for what the sort of total gross add impact that you expect to see? And then, maybe on the ARPU side, how big these components are that are being affected? And how that could potentially play out in that sort of 1% to 3% service revenue decline you're expecting? And then maybe a new topic on the Fios side. When did you guys start the new policy of not entering consumers' homes? And I saw -- I think you -- it shows here that Internet net adds are definitely slowing, but do you expect that to go negative? And then, what do you see for video trends as we look out into the second quarter? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, John. So following up on the service revenue. When you think about the ARPU, you've got the base billing and then you've got the additional things that go in there whether that be international roaming, whether it be overages, whether it be late fees or whatnot. So we feel really good about the core billings within the business. We're seeing customers use our products and services, obviously on a -- in a very strong fashion and I should expect to see that continue. But where we will see some pressure is around the edges with those other parts of what we bill, whether as I say it be roaming overages or whatnot. So the vast majority of that 3% to 5% comes from those items that we bill that are in the service revenue line. And then on top of that, you'll have the impact of suspends on the SMB side. We'll see how much that plays in. So overall, most of the -- we will see an impact in ARPU there as we go through the quarter. But subs are looking in a great position as we mentioned the churn is at a low level. You're looking at about a 0.5 type of range right now in Consumer. Obviously, that's very low compared to where it has been. And I think it reflects the fact as you go into a time like this consumers obviously value the quality of their network connection with all the increased activity we've seen across it. So all in all, that's where you'll see the majority of the impacts in service revenue as we go into the second quarter here. And I'll turn it over to Hans and provide some comments around what we're doing with Fios and the engineers going into consumers' homes and whatnot.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. And John, let me say one thing that we have been balancing all the time is of course safe and -- safety and health for our employees. And that's why we were very early on to actually close down almost 70% of our stores and go to new sort of visiting hours and all of that. The same we have done with our engineers in the field very important for us to see that they are safe and healthy. And in the beginning here, we were very restricted on visited on homes. But we've also seen a lot of innovation. And the last couple of weeks here, we have actually innovated so we can start installing Fios without going into the homes with both what we call the Fios in the box, which is where the consumer or the customer is installing themselves. As well as we also have a virtual agent right now where the customer can be guided how to do the installation. That innovation we have been able to do in two, three weeks and now we start ramping that up. And I'm confident that over time, we almost can be back on a normal levels of installation, but with the safe and healthy of our employees and as well for our customers. And I think that again, just coming back to the importance on balancing, in a crisis like this you need to balance all the different stakeholders and see that you really have the priorities right. And our priority has been from the beginning the safety and health for our employees. That's very important. Second is of course to see that our networks are staying up because of the importance of our infrastructure in these times. Because we know that the country is needing our network and our technology staying up and having the highest quality as Verizon always has. So we are managing that every day here and I think we're managing it very well. And as said, the innovation is now piling up and we can go back to something that is normal, but in a totally new way of doing it. So I'm grateful for my team.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, John. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. To clarify one more time on this 3% to 5% in 2Q, can you please confirm that versus your prior expectation for year-over-year growth rather than just year-over-year? And also, can you quantify what the service revenue headwind was in the first quarter versus the regular business growth rate? And then second, Verizon Media revenue sounds like down 20% to 30% in the second quarter. What do the margins look like in this business? We don't really know much about what the sort of cost flexibility is there and whether margins can stay positive or flip to negative when revenue comes down quickly. Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Phil. So as you look at the service revenue and you think about the impacts in there, the 3% to 5% is really is going to be 3% to 5% lower than they otherwise would have been. A reduction in the growth rates on a year-over-year basis is what you'll see there. There was a small impact on service revenue in the first quarter. If you think across both consumer in the 30 to 40 basis points of service revenue growth, so the 1.9% would have had some upside without the impact that we saw at the back end of March. But we're in -- we like where the position of the service revenue trajectory is. As you come into the quarter as you go into 2Q here, the core underlying performance of the wireless business in both consumer and business is very strong. And we expect to see that show up in our service revenues throughout the rest of the year.\nHans Vestberg: Something about the Verizon Media Group, as Matt reported, of course, that we have seen an impact lately on our advertising. We're of course encouraged about the increased activity and the growth of engagement because that's ultimately going to pay off later on. And I think that first of all our Verizon Media team has been extremely innovative with new products and new ways of delivering services the last couple of weeks here in a time of this pandemic. I have to say that I have a lot of confidence in my Verizon Media Group to work with different scenarios given how this pandemic will develop and how it will hit Verizon Media Group. We have seen the last 18 months or I don't know six quarters that our Verizon Media Group has found ways to both reduce direct cost and find new ways to innovate. But all-in-all, we need to understand that of course advertising these days you are restrictive, you're cautious given the pandemic. But again I think that as I said in the beginning, we are working with different scenarios that can happen and we have different levers and activities that we can do given where this is going. That goes for all our different businesses, which of course they are in different form and shape at the moment but it also goes for the whole corporation. And then just adding on what Matt said about our wireless business, I think that one thing that worked in the brand, since we embarked on the unlimited some two years ago, we have constantly built a model, which can actually meet all the different scenarios, all the way from our Mix & Match, or in Visible, Yahoo Mobile the work we're doing with track phone, the network as a service. I think that regardless where it will go, we will have opportunities to actually serve our customers with the plans that they need. And I think that few others can do that in this market as well as we have the best network. So I think we're well-positioned in the world that might be uncertain, but we have all those different type of opportunities to serve our customers.\nMatt Ellis: And just real quick on the cost side there that comes, obviously, the service revenue impact and the media revenue impact. But obviously we're doing things to manage the cost side of the business as we go through this period. And it's really building on the work we've been doing for the last few years now and it's put us in a position where we can take the actions that we need to in this time. We'll see some cost benefits as we go through this. But it also allows us to do the things to support our employees and customers and to keep investing in the business for the long haul even as we're in this unusual time period. So cost controls are very much on our mindset as we go through this time period as well.\nPhil Cusick: If I can just clarify as well on Brett's question, you said that a lot of the impact I think for the EPS cuts in the second quarter. But I think it would make sense that you're guiding for probably weaker earnings through the year. Is that fair?\nMatt Ellis: Most of the impact in the guide is the impact that we discussed in the second quarter. As we look to the second half of the year, obviously, there's a very wide range of potential outcomes there. So we'll see how that plays out. And obviously when we're on this -- the next earning call 90 days from now, we'll have a lot more to say about the second half of the year. But a lot of the commentary we had and a lot of the updates in the guide relates to what we'll see in 2Q. But we will see some of those revenue impacts you think about international roaming for example will stay with us for a longer time period. But we'll wait and talk more about the second half of the year when we have better visibility into it.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Phil. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could, first, just kind of looking at the slide 17 where you give us the COVID environment effect on the mobile business. Could you give us some of that similar color consumer SMB and enterprise on the wireline side? And then second, obviously, last quarter there was a big investment in the business services group in terms of trying to modernize the tech and the go-to-market capabilities. Could you elaborate a little bit on what's been accomplished thus far in that exercise? And what in the current environment your expectations might be for the return on that investment at this stage? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. That's -- let's unpack those. Starting off with the wireline impact on the current environment. In Fios, we talked a little bit about that. We saw good volumes in Internet in the first quarter, but that was largely a reflection of low churn as we came into this. And obviously a lot of appreciation from our customer base on the quality of the Fios Internet product. As you go into the second quarter, you're going to continue to see the benefit on the churn side, but obviously we'll have some impact on the gross adds side from the employee actions that Hans mentioned where we're not allowing employees to really enter customers' homes. What's really good -- what you see from us is say okay, how do we react to this? So Hans talked about the FiOS in a box right. Let's not let this environment completely stop what we're doing. How do we -- yes there's an obstacle in our way. Let's find a way around it. This team is phenomenal on doing that. So, we will have some gross adds here in the quarter that we might not have expected when we first stopped going into customers' homes. As you look across the other parts of wireline, as you get into SMB, and the larger businesses obviously, as we've seen an uptick in usage across the core networks and we've been doing a number of things to help especially our larger enterprise customers adapt very quickly to having their -- a large number of their employees work from home and having to update their systems to be able to handle that change in network traffic and where the work is performed. So, I would expect to see a continuation of that. But it won't massively change the ongoing wireline trends -- revenue trends that we've seen across the business as we think about second quarter here. In terms of the investment in VBG and what you see in the margins in the first quarter there, I think we came in with a decent margin for that group. But as I said on the call back in January, this isn't a one quarter investment in the business. There's a number of things that we need to do to upgrade the capabilities of our Business group, so that we can be that partner of choice for businesses as we enter the fourth industrial revolution. And so there's a lot of good activity going on there. And I'll stick with what I said on the last call that we'll be investing in that for quite a while here. We should start to see the impact -- the benefits on the cost side towards the end of this year. And then, the impacts on the revenue side in '21 and really getting full steam in '22, so a lot to come there. And Hans, I'll let you follow-up on that.\nHans Vestberg: Yes you're absolutely right, Matt. This is -- we are clear on the strategy of the Verizon Business Group. I just want to remind all of you we brought together several different groups on wireline and wireless and this go-to-markets. Tami and the team has very clear strategy of doing the transformation. That has not slowed down. We continue with that because, when coming into this COVID-19, we see even a more importance of Verizon Business Group and then me and Matt talked about, this is one of the areas we see that we have a great opportunity going forward as we build a Verizon Intelligent Edge Network as we come with 5G and the trends in the industry. I mean digitalization all of that which of course has been accentuated in this COVID-19. So, I feel good about what we're doing here. The team is running as fast as they can with this transformation. But as Matt said, this is not the one quarter thing, but we're not holding back on the transformation. And in that transformation, we said we will invest and one investment was of course the BlueJeans, which we have had in our portfolio for a couple of quarters as a distributor. But as this turned out, we felt that it was a good opportunity to actually make the acquisition and we have been testing them. It's a great product. And we stitch that into our go-to-market in the Verizon Business Group. But I also see it as a great opportunity for the 5G. Because ultimately 5G at the edge, we will have a lot of low latency enormous throughput where video and transcoding will be important. So, adding that asset is also important for the future. So, once again we feel good about our strategy in Verizon Business Group and how they have performed. And we have some more work to be done and we're not holding back on that transformation as that will put us in even stronger position when they're done.\nDavid Barden: Thanks guys.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Dave. Hey Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Good morning. Thanks for all the color on the COVID-19. Very helpful. I wonder Matt if you could get into a little more on the bad debt, help us understand where that is across the Consumer versus Business. I'm guessing a lot of it's in SMB. How does that break wireless wireline? And then, Hans, could you talk a little bit about the digital channels. You talked a lot about FiOS in a box. How are you thinking about maybe pushing more of the phone sales and wireless sales through the online channel? Where are you today? And what can you do to increase that percentage? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks Simon. So, on the bad debt as we look at that the vast majority of it is sitting in the Consumer side just because of the relative difference in the size of the businesses between Consumer and SMB. As we did the bad debt reserve this year, we're now operating under the new CECL accounting standards. It requires us to take a more forward look at expected losses. And so really what we did, we took -- we looked at how many customers have availed themselves of the pledge. We used that as a starting point for the reserve. I can tell you as of around mid-April, we have around 800,000 customers who have signed up for the pledge and some of the various other state ordered. The vast majority of those are in mobile and that provided some of the bases. But it's too early to know exactly how the bad debt requirements will play out. We'll monitor that closely here as we go forward. But certainly we're seeing different payment patterns across different parts of our customer base. Actually encouraged by what we're seeing on the consumer side here over the last couple of weeks. And another proof point that as we've talked about in the past as we saw in the financial crisis that consumers continue to put their phone bill high up their list of priorities for payments. And certainly we're monitoring closely on the Business side, especially within SMB, how that's going to play out. Nothing in the payment patterns at this point is overly pessimistic but we're obviously going to stay very close to that and work to keep our relationship with our customers wherever possible. So that hopefully gives you a little background on how we look at the bad debt. And I'll let Hans answer the question on how we see digital channels going forward.\nHans Vestberg: So let me just lay out how we're running the company right now. We're basically running the company in a three-pronged strategy. The first prong is of course, the crisis management, where we have a team that is dealing with all the challenges with pandemic for our employees, for our customers and for the society at large. Secondly, I have the majority of my leadership team, running business as usual. We have our 5G governance early this week where we went through all the deployment, all the 5G mobile edge compute, all the new business cases just running as normal. And then we have a team, which also think about the new normal. What will be the new normal when we come out on this pandemic? And one of the question which is I think, I believe is going to happen we're going to see much more digital sort of omnichannel from our customers and we are ready for it. We have already pivot to it. We're probably going to see another environment \u2013 work environment that we need to think about. We're probably going to also see a different type of product that we need to put forward. So I try to see that we have all these three prongs working at the same time in order for us to come up even stronger from this crisis, as well as managing today and not missing our target put up, as well as managing the crisis at the same time. So I can only confirm I have the same feelings you have. We're going to see much more of digital usage of ordering. But we're also going to see things that we never thought were possible. I mean Telehealth will increase over time. People are now and still they don't need to go to hospital. We're going to see education \u2013 remote education growing because people see that it's actually working. All that's going to be new normal, where we \u2013 our assets are extremely important in that delivery to all our customer groups. So you need to work on all three of them and we are working all three of them to come even stronger out on this crisis.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, thanks, Simon. Hey, Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. I wonder if I could just ask a slightly longer-term question in the context of the COVID crisis. Your investments in wireless which have largely been \u2013 in 5G I mean, which have largely been on the back of millimeter wave spectrum have almost necessarily been in dense urban gathering places, like stadiums and arenas and airports and what have you, which is obviously where people aren't today. Do you stop and say there may be a real change in social patterns that suggest a different set of investment priorities that are more along the lines of coverage and less around dense urban usage? Or is that likely to be sort of a short-term blip just given how long the planning windows are for network densification? I ask this in the context of a spectrum strategy, where it could well be that mid-band spectrum becomes even more important now given a potential pivot away from those very dense urban gathering places.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. It's still to be seen first of all of what will be the social patterns for the time. I feel pretty confident that dense urban areas will continue to be dense urban areas. At the moment, we still see a lot of usage in dense urban areas. It's just that we see less movement of people because they are staying home. So people live where they live today. So we are not changing the strategy how we execute both on the broader nationwide, as well on our city deployment. And ultimately, we see that as being a very compelling offering going in the future. On the mid-band, as I said before, especially on the C-band, we think that is an attractive spectrum because first of all as you said, it is a good coverage. But also it's a global roaming standard for 5G. And of course, we want to be part of that. And we are encouraged by FCC's plan to conduct a C-band auction in December. And we will always do our normal return on investment between the different densifications, buying spectrum, putting more software and keeping in mind that we want to continue to have the same headrooms in the network as we always have in order to have the best network. So yes it plays in. It's a little bit too early to say that we're going to have a changed total social pattern in the United States. Initially, I don't think so. People live where they live and that's going to continue to be the same.\nCraig Moffett: And can you comment specifically about, the L-band uplink concept and the availability now of Ligado spectrum?\nHans Vestberg: Yes I can, or at least having some views on it. We of course are following what FCC has come out. We still feel that are several challenges with L-band. As -- first of all it's not used, that frequency is not used anywhere in the world. That means that there are no equipment, no handsets and things like that which you need an ecosystem. That's so important. But as with all frequencies and all, the spectrum, we're of course looking into it. And we have done it for seven years. This is nothing new. I think that Ligado has been around for about 10 years. So it's nothing new. So we are continuing -- our engineers are always looking into new development if something can happen. But so far we have seen a little bit more headwind than anything else on that band.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great, two if I may. First off I was wondering, if can you give us the number of customers that have stopped paying their bills I guess specifically their wireless bills, as a result of COVID-19? And I assume that that number was included in your, disconnect? You'd mentioned, I think 800,000 in response to Simon's question. Just trying to understand where that number comes into play? And then secondly as it relates to, free cash flow and the dividend. I was wondering if you can just give us some framework in terms of how to think about the potential dividend payout, expected in 2020? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: You can start, if you unmute.\nMatt Ellis: Sorry about that. Hans it's really helpful. Thanks Colby. So the number of customers who are referred to in the prior question was the number of customers who have told us their ability to pay their bills has been impacted by COVID. That's not to say they've been disconnected. They haven't been disconnected. Just like every other customer that doesn't pay completely on time that we work with them. And the vast majority of those we end up getting them back on a payment schedule and they continue their relationship with us. So, we haven't -- and even those who have -- provided themselves of that, doesn't necessarily mean that they have completely stopped paying. They are just indicating to us that they've seen an impact. But when you look at the total impact we've seen, when I compare it to some of the numbers reported by -- whether it be on the mortgage side or the auto loan side we're seeing a better overall performance in terms of the customer payment profile than what we've seen. And that's consistent with what we saw in the financial crisis in 2008 as well. I mean we have a very important product for our customers and they value it. They value the connection they get from the best network and we see those, show up in the payment. So Hans, I think, you wanted to make some comments around the second question on free cash flow?\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. First of all, I think we talked about where we stand on the balance sheet and the great work the team has done with the balance sheet not only the last couple of years but also in the first quarter. And we feel that we're in a very good position with our balance sheet. And that can be seen that we both increased our CapEx this quarter as well as made the acquisition of BlueJeans. We have our capital allocation priorities very clear for us. Number one is the business. Number two is the shareholders. Three is the debt reduction and number four is the buyback. And we feel that we're in a really good situation to continue to put our Board in the right position to serve our shareholders with dividend. But as we said on the Investor Day, when it comes to buybacks that's probably unlikely happening this year given the situation, but all other priorities we are definitely in a very good position to serve at this moment.\nColby Synesael: Okay, thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Colby. Hey Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups, first you gave a lot of detail on the potential impacts on revenue. I was curious if you could provide some additional details to quantify or help to approximate the variability of wireless expenses to the variability of gross adds or overall device sales? And then secondly, does the temporary use of other license holder's spectrum, increase Verizon's interest to rent or lease spectrum on a commercial basis in the future? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Thanks Mike. So I'll answer the first question on the variability of expenses. So obviously as we have lower volumes, you see lower handset costs and that obviously close through immediately. But a lot of the other expenses as you think about it in the immediate term don't necessarily move. Even promo costs for example as we've talked about before, we now under, 606 amortize a lot of the promo expense over the expected life. So you see that come across over 2.5 years typically versus an immediate cost. So if we get a reduction, a benefit of lower promo expenses also gets amortized over that time period in the income statement. So you're going to see that flow through there. Other areas where you see an impact from volumes, where we have lower volumes, especially in store we see lower accessory sales and those typically have a good margin on. And so, there are impacts there as well from seeing lower sales, not just in terms of lower expenses, but there is an impact on the revenue line that can come with that. So net-net, you do see a reduction in cost with lower volumes, but there's some other things that go in the other direction and some of the benefits and expense are going to get realized over time, rather than immediately in there. So, hopefully, that helps you think around how that shows up in the income statement. Hans, I'll let you add -- follow up on the question on the spectrum that we took advantage of.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. First of all, we want to thank the FCC for so rapidly come out and lending out spectrum to all the players in the market, because nobody knew how the usage will be on the network. As you can see, when we exclude the temporary spectrum that we lent from FCC, we have the same headroom and the network has performed very well. On top of that, we are, of course, adding capacity right now and also put in the DSS, the dynamic spectrum sharing, which I can report that the tests are going very well. We're on plan for putting that opportunity in the hands of Tami and Ronan to decide when they want to turn on nationwide. So, I think, we have a very good spectrum strategy and with the spectrum we have and we're very happy with it and we're going to continue with that. So, I think, that's where we are right now.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. Thanks Mike. Hey, Brad, we have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Hans, I just wanted to follow-up on your DSS comments. So if I go back to my notes from mid-February following the Analyst Day, it seemed like you were very firm in saying DSS by year-end -- with 5G by year-end with DSS. Is there any change to that? And then, just on the infrastructure behind it, you also talked about -- or Kyle talked about five times the amount of small cells for 5G this year. Has any of the shifts, given the changes in social patterns, shifted back the macro there? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Jennifer. First of all, we feel good about the dynamic spectrum sharing. We are continue to do the test and deploying equipment and the hardware in the field that is needed for doing that. I'm certain that Kyle and his team will put it in the hands of Ronan and Tami and decide when they turn it on in the second half. That's where we are today. So we're not -- have any supply issues to doing that or supply chain issues. The same go for the five times more -- 5G ready base station this year. We continue to just accelerate. And Kyle actually said publicly that we were ahead of the plan when we ended March. I can say today, we're still on plan on that 5x. We have no supply chain issues. We have, of course, complications with some municipalities, but our team is all around that and working with municipalities, finding new way, digital approval, things that we never thought were -- digital permitting processes, et cetera, which we never thought were possible. So, all-in-all, we are not giving up on those targets. And so far it looks really good. And that's how a company should execute in times like this, managing the crisis, seeing that it will be a new and rethink how the new normal will look like. And that's what my team is doing every day right now and we are very focused on doing that. And the good thing is that, we feel good about our strategy where it stands.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. And thanks Jennifer and Hans and team. And everybody, make sure you stay safe and be well. And with that, we'll conclude the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}], "2022": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-01-25 12:46:06", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Brady Connor, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. As a reminder, we are still in the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction so we will not be able to comment on our mid-band spectrum holdings or strategy. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share, resulting in full year earnings of $5.32 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported fourth quarter earnings include a net pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes a charge of $2.4 billion for the early extinguishment of debt, a $106 million charge related to severance, a $1.2 billion credit pertaining to the annual mark-to-market for our pension and OPEB liabilities and a net gain of $131 million primarily related to the disposition of an investment. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the fourth quarter and $5.39 for the full year. We completed the acquisition of TracFone on November 23. The revenue associated with TracFone this year was approximately $700 million higher than the revenue received from TracFone in the fourth quarter of 2020. All of this revenue flows through our Consumer Group. As noted in our press release this morning, beginning in 2022, our adjusted earnings per share will exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. For 2021, such intangible amortization negatively impacted adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.11. And for 2022, we anticipate the impact to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19. Finally, we will be hosting our Annual Investor Day event on March 3 in New York City, where our leadership team will provide further details on our company's exciting plans for this year and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of 2021.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and happy new year to all of you. This past week has been one of the best since I joined Verizon. On January 19, we successfully launched 5G Ultra Wideband on C-band, which will enable more Americans than ever before to experience a transformative speed, reliability and power of our multipurpose network on the go, in their home or for their businesses. Our work throughout 2021 brought us to this moment, and I will spend this call discussing how we got here and how our accomplishment will accelerate our growth. I want to thank our incredible V team for all your hard work and dedication throughout 2021 and for delivering for our customers and our communities. We have never executed so well on so many strategic and operational objectives as we did in 2021. This was a catalyst via Verizon, and I'm very proud of our work. We have a clear and disciplined strategy based on our multipurpose network that creates economies of scale and new business models in an era where broadband is essential to our customers and society. Our results clearly confirm that our strategy is working and that 2021 was a transformative year for Verizon, and it clearly sets us up for a high impact year in 2022. We have now assembled the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of high-quality assets, leveraging our best-in-class technology to extend our network leadership to address more opportunities than anyone else in the market. We're widely being recognized for both what we have accomplished and for the 28th time in a row, J.D. Power ranked Verizon first for network quality. This is our 175th J.D. Power Network Quality Award in 18 years. At the same time, we continue to support our four stakeholders: shareholders, customers, employees and society as a responsible business. Verizon leads the industry in sustainability. We are ranked ahead of our peers, both by the Drucker Institute and JUST 100, and we are confident that our multi-stakeholder strategy will lead to long-term shareholder value. We have a team and expertise to lead the country into a vibrant mobile computing future. Verizon has the best engineers in the world, and they have built a world forward reliable and scalable network. This asset is the foundation and the catalyst for our accelerating growth. So we begin 2022 with a strong portfolio of assets. We're executing our 5G strategy, making great progress on our five vectors of growth and delivering a premier customer experience. This significant momentum sets us up for 2022 and beyond. Let me give an update on the financial and operation metrics. During 2021's first quarter, we set clear targets. As we close out 2021 and enter in 2022, I'm proud to report that we delivered on all of them plus some, and our achievements will only capitalize even greater value creation in 2022. On our January 19 C-band deployment, we covered more than 90 million POPs and millions of homes in more than 1,700 cities, well ahead of plan on making excellent use of the incremental capital spend to augment and accelerate our business opportunities. Today, we cover more than 95 million POPs as the team is progressing also brought more than 15,000 additional 5G Ultra Wideband small cells in service, exceeding our annual goal and nearly doubling our total 5G millimeter wave presence, increasing our fiber footprint to create a state-of-the-art multipurpose network. At our Investor Day last year, we said we would have 5% to 10% traffic in urban areas covered by millimeter wave. Today, we're almost at 10%, it's exceeding our expectation. This confirms our millimeter wave strategy. All this had stage for last week's Verizon Ultra Wideband launch. We're excited and pleased with what we have seen so far from customer reception to network performance. We have grown our network significantly. We finished 2021 with over 20 million households covered for our fixed wireless access solutions and T-band adds millions more homes. For business, our initial C-band expansion will recover more than 1.7 million organizations with Verizon 5G business Internet across 900 cities. We will reach new retail and business clients by offering a breadth of plan options that make our capabilities relevant to their lives. Our new mix and match 4.0 offerings allow customers to pick the 5G plan they want with options for savings on home Internet. For businesses, we offer business unlimited offerings that bring choice and power to the professional market. In addition to our network achievements, we closed on two large strategic transactions in 2021. We sold Verizon Media Group to Apollo Global Management for $5 billion in a transaction that closed in September, retaining minority ownership. And in November, we completed our strategic acquisition of TracFone, positioning Verizon as the number one provider within the value segment. This opportunity enables us to deepen our relationship with new customers while delivering more enhanced services. TracFone is being rapidly integrated into our operation. The acquisition added 20 million customers to our prepaid model and cements Verizon as a leading prepaid vendor at Walmart and Best Buy forming a strong foundation of our retail efforts. We also continue to reach new customers through bundled Internet telephone and television services. Fios Internet adds in 2021 were our best since 2014, and we continue to expand availability of the best-in-class service. Importantly, we strengthened our relationship with our customers adding more connections, including more than 0.5 million new wireless postpaid phone net adds, while maintaining and cultivating our loyal, high-quality relationships. We provided additional value for our customers through our unique partnership strategy with the best brands that are meaningful to people, lives and businesses. This includes content partnership with NFL, Disney, Apple, Discovery and Niantic to name a few. For businesses, we offer mobile edge compute capabilities, something we're first in the world with alongside industry leaders like AWS, Google and Microsoft. Disruptions to consumer and industrial supply chains throughout 2021 and extending into this year have affected all industries and brought digital connectivity to the central focus in the lives of our stakeholders. That said, Verizon has executed effectively under discussion as demonstrated by our successful network expansion and network service launches. Once again, our financial performance demonstrates our strategy is working. Our focus on profitable volume continues to drive wireless service revenue growth of 4.7% in 2021. And in the fourth quarter, 74% of our customers subscribed to an unlimited plan compared to 71% in Q3. Just over one-third of our unlimited subscribers have unlimited premium. This leaves room for continued step-up expansion. Our multipurpose network and flexible plans will also help customers to upgrade handsets and devices. We saw quick adoption of 5G handsets throughout 2021 in anticipation of new services. One-third of our customers' handsets are now 5G-enabled compared to about 25% in the third quarter. We raised our earnings per share and wireless service revenue guidance during the year and deliver on both including 10% EPS growth. We promised also $10 billion in cost savings, and we deliver ahead of schedule. However, we continuously strive to more efficiently manage our business. We generated strong cash flows to support our investments and financial commitment, and we delivered our 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payments while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. As for our focus on ESG, Citizen, Verizon has also delivered on its promises. We took action towards meeting our 2025 goals, including spending to support technology education and adoption to bridge digital divide and contracting for significant renewable energy capacity, positioning the Company to achieve over 50% renewable energy goal by 2025. Matt will highlight on our performance and 2022 guidance in detail. But we will target organic service and other revenue of around 3% as well as EBITDA growth of 2% to 3%. With the right assets in place and a sound strategy to reach consumers and businesses with 5G capabilities and mobile edge computing on our multipurpose network, Verizon has unlimited potential. 2022 will demonstrate this. Now, I will turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our fourth quarter and full year performance in greater detail.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results where we continue to deliver strong financial and operating performance. Before I get into the 2021 results, let me add my own congratulations to the Verizon team for achieving our C-band build targets well ahead of schedule and for the successful commercial launch week. The C-band deployment provides so many opportunities for us. As Hans mentioned, our strategy is working and these results demonstrate our ability to compete effectively to drive new high-quality customers to our platforms while also serving our best-in-class customer base. We do this with the financial discipline that enables us to deliver attractive service revenue growth and profitability as evidenced by another strong earnings performance with healthy cash generation. It starts with our award-winning networks, which enable both our consumer and business organizations to deliver the best products, services and experiences to customers. With the acquisition of TracFone, the deployment of C-band spectrum, new mix and match plans, and the strongest and most innovative team in the industry, 2022 is positioned to be our best year yet. Let's take a look at these results beginning on Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, consolidated total revenue was $34.1 billion, down 1.8% from the prior year. Adjusting for the sale of Verizon Media Group on September 1, consolidated revenue grew 4.8%, strong wireless service revenue growth and wireless equipment revenue were offset by continued declines in legacy wireline products. Total wireless service revenue was up 6.5% for the quarter. The results were driven by a combination of ARPA and volume growth, consistent with our strategy and the contribution from the TracFone acquisition. For the full year, wireless service revenue grew 4.7%, including TracFone, and was in line with the increased guidance we provided at the end of the third quarter when adjusted for the TracFone acquisition. Total Fios revenue was $3.2 billion and grew 5.7% for the fourth quarter, driven by strong customer demand for our high-quality connectivity services. Full year FiOS revenue was approximately $12.7 billion, up 4.6% over the prior year. Service and other revenue grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, while on a reported basis it declined 5.4% from the prior year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $11.8 billion, relatively flat compared to last year as growth in consumer was offset by declines in business and the impact of the Verizon Media Group sale. Full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $48.4 billion, up 2.8% from the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2% down 50 basis points primarily due to higher equipment revenues. Earlier in the year and ahead of schedule, we achieved our $10 billion business excellent cost savings goal. We continue to drive efficiency in the business while operating with the best cost structure in the industry and expect strong operating leverage as we execute across all of our five vectors of growth. As Brady mentioned, for the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.31, up 8.3% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our business. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $5.39 was at the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range and is a 10% increase over 2020 results. Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. The strength of our networks and brand, combined with our effective go-to-market strategy are driving improved competitive performance in the market. We continue to expand our high-quality mobility base with strong performance across consumer and business. At the same time, accelerating fixed wireless sales are complementing strong Fios results, expanding our broadband growth opportunity. For the quarter, we delivered 558,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds, an increase over the 279,000 achieved during the same period last year. Postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.81%, roughly in line with the same period last year and better than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the enduring loyalty of our customer base through ordinary and extraordinary times. Total broadband net adds, which includes consumer and business Fios, DSL and fixed wireless totaled $106,000, up 30,000 from the prior year. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, another strong result. Even with a slight uptick in voluntary churn, we continue to experience exceptionally low Fios Internet churn as customers trust the reliability of our network and the simplicity of our mix and match pricing. Our full year Internet net adds of 360,000 represented the best annual performance in 2014, and we now have 6.9 million Fios Internet customers. Demand for our fixed wireless access services continue to grow even before our C-band deployment. FWA net adds, which include both consumer and business fixed wireless products, totaled 78,000, up from 55,000 last quarter. This brings our total FWA customer base to approximately 223,000 at the end of the year. Now let's turn to our consumer group results. Fourth quarter represented another strong financial performance for consumer, highlighted by our best Fios revenue growth in the 2.0 area, wireless service revenue momentum and healthy profitability. We are clearing the benefits of our focused go-to-market organization. Consumer operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $25.7 billion, up 7.4% year-over-year. Service and other revenue of $19.4 billion was up 5.2% versus the prior year due to strong wireless and Fios revenue growth and a partial quarter contribution from TracFone. As Brady mentioned, the net revenue change from TracFone was approximately $700 million in the quarter, which included incremental service revenue of approximately $500 million year-over-year. For the full year, total Consumer revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago to $95.3 billion, and service and other revenue rose 3.4% to $75.5 billion. Consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter rose 7.7% to $14.6 billion, reflecting ongoing step-ups into unlimited and premium plans as well as the contribution from TracFone. Postpaid ARPA increased 3.2% from the year ago period driven by a higher premium unlimited mix and growth in products and services, such as content, cloud and device protection plans. For the full year, Consumer wireless service revenue was $56.1 billion, up 4.7% from 2020 levels. Consumer Fios revenue totaled $2.9 billion for the fourth, quarter up 5.6% from the year-ago period driven primarily by the strong growth in our broadband base. For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.3 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year or more than $400 million, driven by the service revenue growth. Margins were 40.3%, down 20 basis points from last year due to higher equipment revenues associated with increased volumes. For the full year, EBITDA was $41.6 billion up approximately 1.4 billion or 3.4% versus the prior year. Margins were 43.7% down from 45.5% in the prior year as a result of the approximately 28% equipment revenue growth in the year. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our Consumer operating metrics. Our flexible mix and match plans are at the heart of our go-to-market strategy, supporting continued strong demand for higher tier premium mobility and broadband offerings. Postpaid phone net adds were $336,000 in the quarter. We competed effectively during the holiday season, even as the switcher pool remains soft compared to pre-pandemic levels due to elevated retention promotions in the marketplace. Fourth quarter phone gross adds were up approximately 11% compared to the same period last year, but were approximately 15% lower than the 2019 level. We continue to achieve customer retention with postpaid phone churn of 0.77% for the fourth quarter, relatively flat compared to the same period last year and well below pre-pandemic levels even as trading volumes pick. We maintained the momentum of attracting high-quality customers with approximately 60% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan and over one-third of our base accounts now on a premium unlimited tier. 5G penetration continued to expand with approximately 34% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device at year-end. We expect to drive further 5G Ultra Wideband adoption with the launch last week of our C-band spectrum to more than 90 million POPs, combined with our updated mix and match offerings introduced earlier this month. With the close of the acquisition, TracPhone results are now included in consumer prepaid. We finished the year as the nation's leading value segment provider with approximately 24 million total prepaid customers including the approximately 20 million customers acquired from TracFone. For the quarter, prepaid net customer losses totaled $85,000, which included 52,000 net losses on the TracFone businesses stemming from stronger demand for postpaid plans due to promos in that segment, coupled with handset supply constraint. Now let's move to Slide 10 to review the business group results. Operating revenue for the business segment was $7.8 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3.0% year-over-year. We faced elevated pressures in the quarter in both public sector and wholesale, and we expect these pressures to moderate in 2022. Full year operating revenue was $31.0 billion, up slightly year-over-year driven by strong wireless performance. Wireless service revenue increased 1.5% and wireless equipment revenue was up 9.6% in the fourth quarter. Wireless service revenue was driven by growth in small and medium business and enterprise performance improved for the fourth consecutive quarter and was the highest growth since the start of the pandemic. While this was partially offset by a decline in public sector due to the elevated distance learning activity in the year ago period, our Verizon frontline campaign is resonating with stakeholders, helping drive new customer growth. Wireline trends remain under pressure as we continue to face prior year comps that included pandemic buying. In addition, approximately one-third of our declines came from voice services where we continue to feel the impact of our strategic initiative to exit the low-margin international wholesale voice market. Business segment EBITDA was $1.8 billion, down 7.4% from the same quarter last year. Business segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, reflecting pressure in legacy wireline products and our commitment to invest in new product growth and drive customer demand for our wireless solutions. Full year margins were 24.2%, down 120 basis points from last year. We exited the year with strong momentum in business activity and demand for our wireless products. With the recent launch of our C-band spectrum, we are in an even better position to serve the 5G needs of our business customers throughout 2022. For the quarter, phone gross adds were up approximately 22% year-over-year and 8% from 4Q 2019 levels. The fourth quarter represented the strongest quarterly phone gross add performance for small and medium business and enterprise since launching Verizon 2.0. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, which was up slightly over the prior year. As a result, total postpaid phone net adds were $222,000, our best quarterly performance since the onset of the pandemic. Now let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. Cash generation remains strong for 2021 as we achieved our financial targets and executed on our capital allocation plan. We spent over $45 billion of C-band spectrum and expanded our portfolio with the TracFone acquisition, all while increasing our dividend for the 15th straight year and making progress to maintain a healthy balance sheet. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $39.5 billion for the year, a decline of $2.2 billion. This result primarily reflects strong performance in the business with increased adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion, offset by higher working capital from device payment receivables and slightly higher cash taxes. Capital spending in 2021 totaled $20.3 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network while initiating the first phase of C-band deployment covering 90 million POPs. C-band-related CapEx was approximately $2.1 billion in 2021. As a result, free cash flow for the full year was $19.3 billion, down from $23.6 billion in 2020. The highlights of our financing activity in 2021 was efficiently funding our C-band spectrum investment in the first quarter. Since then, we are focused on further optimizing our cash position and debt maturity profile with activity to reduce or extend near-term maturities, while deploying excess cash to retire longer-dated high-coupon bonds. We accomplished this while maintaining ample flexibility to invest in our business such as fund in the recent TracFone acquisition. We are also active with our ABS funding program to finance the increased device payment receivables as consumers upgrade to 5G phones. We exited the year with $133.7 billion of net unsecured debt, a $3.7 billion reduction from the end of the first quarter. Our unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.8 times at year-end, in line with our 2021 Investor Day guidance. Our financing activities over the past two years have reduced our average portfolio borrowing costs by about 1% as compared to 2019, albeit with higher debt levels. Our cash balance at the end of the year was $2.9 billion, down approximately $7.0 billion sequentially, bringing us back to normal levels. Let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss our outlook for 2022. We have great momentum from the strong operating and financial results last year and are well positioned heading into the new year, and that momentum is reflected in our guidance for 2022. We took many strategic actions to position the Company for better growth and our increased guidance disclosures provide greater insight into our financial outlook. At our Investor Day last year, we provided guidance of at least 3% service and other revenue for 2022 and 2023. For 2022, we expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3%. On a reported basis, which includes the net impact of the sale of Verizon Media Group and our ownership of TracFone, service and other revenue growth is expected to range between 1.0% and 1.5%. Similarly, on a reported basis, wireless service revenue growth for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10%, driven by growth from our tiered unlimited strategy, the impact of the TracFone acquisition, and a ramping fixed wireless access contribution. Excluding the impact of the TracFone acquisition, wireless service revenue is expected to grow at least 3%. We expect total adjusted EBITDA to grow 2% to 3% in 2022, driven by top line growth and ongoing cost discipline. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $5.40 to $5.55. As the waterfall chart shows, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth, including a small positive net contribution from the TracFone and Media transactions to be offset by headwinds from below-the-line items. These items include approximately $0.15 from our C-band investment, including higher depreciation and lower capitalized interest as we put the spectrum into service, $0.07 share dilution as a result of shares issued in the TracFone acquisition, and other noncash impacts such as D&A and pension and OPEB expense. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year, excluding C-band, is expected to be between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion, a decrease from the $18.2 billion in 2021, and as we have started our progress towards lower capital intensity. C-band capital spend is anticipated to be between $5 billion to $6 billion as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations to deploying Phase II spectrum. For 2022, cash flow from operations are expected to be driven by higher operating income, offset by increased working capital from device payment receivables as well as higher cash taxes. We are extremely excited for 2022 and expect it to be our biggest year yet. The second wave of 5G is here, and we are leading the way into the future of connectivity. We have the necessary assets and strategy to unlock the full potential of our growth vectors. With that, I will hand it over to Hans to discuss our 2022 strategic priorities.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. The assets are in place to make 2022 Verizon's best year yet. Coming off a catalyst year, we are excited to execute on our 5G growth and deliver the financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day back in March of last year. We have clear priorities for the year. We will continue our legacy of disciplined execution and look forward to delivering against our operation and financial targets that Matt just outlined. We expect organic service and other revenue growth of around 3% in 2022. And we also expect to increase EBITDA by 2% to 3%. We commit to strengthen and growing our core business and commercializing our unique assets. By combining our Verizon Ultra Wideband with the new mix and match plans, we can supercharge 5G Ultra Wideband adoption to enhance customer experiences and to increase average revenue per user. At the same time, we will continue to expand our fixed wireless access positioning Verizon as a premier nationwide broadband provider. We believe that Verizon's fixed wire access offering will drive the next leg of broadband growth, increasing our market share and reach. We will innovate in our business of business offerings, bringing mobile edge computing to our enterprise clients and transform the Internet of Things from a vision to reality. You should continue to expect us to sign new clients and provide examples on how the mobile edge compute is addressing the complex needs of our customers. We will benefit from our leading position in the value segment. The integration of TracFone will form the basis of deep and productive relationships that can grow to meet our customers' changing needs throughout life. We will continue to run Verizon as a purpose-driven organization. We will pursue C-band and 5G leadership because these technologies are critical for economic prosperity and driving innovation for all, not just for Verizon. We will continue to serve all of our stakeholders, shareholders, customers, employees and society. And lastly, I also hope to see you all again at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. With that, I hand it back to Brady.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nBrett Feldman: With regards to the guidance you've given for about 3% growth in service and other revenue, very similar to your growth target for just straight up wireless service revenue. Could you give us a little more insight as to what you anticipate to be the principal drivers? In other words, to what extent is this continuing to see people upgrade into higher tier plans, meaning, it's very much an RPA-driven story. And are we getting to a point where you're expecting a more material contribution in some of those emerging growth opportunities, whether it's fixed wireless or mobile edge compute? And then just one more sort of follow-up there on broadband, now that we're starting to see the fixed wireless net adds begin to ramp, should we expect that they're going to be the predominant driver of your aggregate broadband net adds going forward? And could you give us some insight as to where those customers are coming from? In other words, are they primarily Verizon mobile customers taking a bundle? Or are you actually reaching a new demographic? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. Let me start and get additional matter. When it comes to the growth in 2022, first of all, I think, we're coming in with a great momentum from 2021, both in our business and in our consumer units. Both of them have done a great job at the end of last year. Topping that, of course, with the C-band launch, which we're very excited about, and we see a very, very good performance with our new offerings, both on the business side and the consumer side with mix and match and all of that. That all great, of course, for us, what we feel is a great momentum coming into this year, and we also have the step-ups and as you heard me and Matt talking even though we are continuing to step up our customers, we even have more to do there. And we have a couple of years of more growth coming from that ARPA expansion. So coming into the year, we feel really good about the momentum we have, but also about opportunity in the market on the wireless market. Matt will come back. But on the broadband piece, just quickly then, we, of course, are very excited over the Fios broadband. What we saw last year was the best year in 2014. We will continue to expand the footprint and because we have such a good performance on it and customers love it. And then on top of that, as I said, fixed wirless access is now coming into a totally different model. We have it on 4G. We have millimeter wave. And then, of course, turning on the C-band earlier this month, we just opened up new opportunities for us. Of course, we want to see fixed-wire access continue to grow for us, and this is a super focus for the team. And you asked where the customer comes. First of all, all the fixed virus customers will have. They use these as the primary broadband solution for them. That's very important because that we see on the usage on them. So you saw back up or secondary line on fixed virus access is the primary broadband usage. And secondly, these customers are coming from basically cable and DSL areas where they are using that. So that's where we take them from. They are new to us as broadband customers, and sometimes they are new. They're not even wireless customers. So that's where we get them from right now. And I think that, that's our sweet spot right now when we're a national broadband provider. So all in all, excited we're getting into '22 with all the assets we have right now and, hey, what is sort of the year with all of that coming together so early in the year for us with C-band.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Brett. So just a couple of follow-ups on the service and other revenues. So certainly, we're excited about all the new opportunities ahead of us, such as fixed wireless, as Hans mentioned, and the other five growth vectors. But as you think about 2022, that organic approximately 3% will largely be driven by the momentum we saw coming out of last year. On the business side, very strong volumes in the second half of the year in SMB and Global Enterprise, it gives us a great platform to build on. I would expect the wireless service revenue growth in VBG to be above the 4.8% they did last year at or above that number. So, we'll see the benefit of the strong second half coming through in VBG there. On the consumer side, as Hans mentioned, we have approximately 30% of our customers with -- on a premium unlimited tier. So we have the opportunity to set more customers up. And with the new plans we announced earlier this month, we give customers an even bigger reasons for stepping up to those premium tiers. So that would be the major drivers of the growth during the year. We get into the second half of the year, start to see fixed wireless, especially as that base grows, we'll start to contribute there, but really built on the great momentum we have, coupled with our activities over the past few weeks gives us a lot of excitement as we think about '22.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Maybe first follow-up on your subscriber momentum comment on. It seems like the industry in the fourth quarter slowed from -- seasonally from the pace earlier in the year, and you're typically much lower in the first quarter. Any reason to think that isn't the case this year? And then second, the majority of the C-band deployment looks like it's going to be done this year. And is it fair to assume the remaining $2 billion to $3 billion happens in 2023? I think, Matt, your comment was that CapEx is beginning to come down on sort of an ex-C-band basis. Should we assume that next year might be even below this year's sort of $17 billion?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. On the competitive environment, yes, we saw that in the fourth quarter. And when we are saying that we have the guidance for 2020, we continue to believe it's going to be competitive, but we have great assets. And of course, what is different in the first quarter this year for many other years is, of course, called 5G Ultra Wideband and their C-band. That's a big difference. We are really excited over that announcement. And as you saw, we now cover more than 95 million POPs, and we have great offerings for to our business customers and for our consumers and then topping that fixed piece access and the mobility case. So -- and later on, we can come to talk about mobile edge compute because this also augment our potential in the mobile edge compute. Before I let Matt comment on the CapEx, I just want to say what Matt and I said at the Investor Day last year, we're going to see over the years right now that our capital intensity going down and partly what is what you see in the BAU guidance we do right now. We have done our fiber for a couple of years. We have done the majority of the long hauls, so to say. And we also see that with 5G expansion on C-band, we clearly see over time an offset on the 4G that we can reduce on that. And much of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network that is commonality from the data center to the edge, that also has been ongoing for a while. So that's why we are feeling good about the BAU coming down. And then on the C band, you're absolutely right, $10 billion is the amount we decided and we told Kyle and the team to spend the faster you can because we want these assets up and running as soon as possible. And that's what you see the 5% to 6% right now, we do last year. So, that's with a normal calculation that is roughly two left in the in the year to come. But when it comes to future guidance on CapEx, I think we have to wait with that. But clearly, our target is to continue to be very capital efficient all the time here. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. No, I'll just reiterate a couple of those comments. I mean, absolutely, we're sticking with the $10 billion of incremental. Very pleased with the aggressive pace that Kyle and team have been able to adopt there, which means that we see those -- what we did last year, plus five to six is year leaves a fairly small amount to come through in 2023. And after that, the C-band becomes part of our BAU CapEx number as we add capacity to the network. And we -- as Hans mentioned, we've discussed for a while now, the opportunities to see capital intensity come down and we're starting to see those come through, and they will really accelerate really on the back end of '23, but just one additional item in there. On the one fiber build we've been doing at the end of 2021, we reached a point where we had just over 50% of the markets where we have completed the core network build. So there's only success-based network build taking place in those 50% of the market over the course of the next couple of years. We'll completely complete the core build across all on fiber market. So you have that, you have the reduction in LTE spend as 5G starts to replace it in terms of carrying large amounts of capacity. Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, how much of the capacity millimeter wave has really started to pick up as well. And you can see there's a number of reasons why we feel good about capital intensity going forward here on the BAU. So we will be in a great place going forward. As you look at the spend for last year on C-band 2.1, that's obviously on a cash basis on an incurred basis, the activity in November and December, a large part of that will show up as CapEx in the first quarter here when we pay for those items. So, really strong momentum in terms of what the network team was doing last year. The flywheel is running at full speed now on the C-band build, and you see that with the activity this month so far.\nPhilip Cusick: If I can follow up, Hans, on something you mentioned, I was thinking about anyway. You said that C-band becomes available. You have a lot of capacity. And does that change the way you go to market? Verizon hasn't been tight on capacity, but it hasn't been an excess position in a long time. And now you have all the C-band capacity, does that change your desire to go chase market share?\nHans Vestberg: I think this is sort of the full strategy of Verizon coming together. This was we envisioned and some of us was in conference room in New York in 2018 and talking about Verizon intelligent Edge network. I wanted to build that in order to serve a market where capacity and connectivity is needed all across the network for all type of customers. And clearly, the C-band is just adding enormous lot of capacity for us. But don't forget the millimeter wave now. I mean, that strategy is really working for us as well because we take a lot of the high-volume areas with millimeter wave, which unleash out the spectrum. And hey, we haven't even starting to do a carrier aggregation and using part of our spectrum yet coming into the 5G. So, I would say, clearly, we will be more aggressive on it, especially on fixed wires access because we feel so good about the capacity management and we have the best engineers in the industry. They have never failed the strategies that were put up. So, I feel really good about our capacity. We can go wherever we want. We have Tami and Manon, the two CEOs of our units, going hard on to all the products we have in all angles of the network. So yes, I think we feel really good about our capacities right now and what the team is doing, it's just amazing.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Continuing on the C-band, first of all, I guess, for Hans, is it safe to say we've got the issues with the FAA behind us? And is there any sort of visibility on getting that the affected spectrum up and running and into production. And I guess a follow-on to that, has that had any impact on your business thus far in the year? And then I guess following up on Phil's question, I mean, with the additional C-band capacity, should we expect sort of a more immediate change in trends, either on the mobile or fixed side? And I guess from an incremental standpoint, that you really see a bigger change on the fixed side. How do you expect those net adds to ramp? You saw a nice sequential ramp in fixed wireless net adds going from the third quarter to fourth quarter. Should we expect that to continue as the C-band gets rolled out and your processes to get better and better? And at what point do you get to sort of a normalized run rate of fixed wireless sub growth? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. So first of all, as you heard, our deployment on C-band has been extremely successful, basically deliver a quarter ahead, and the guys has brought up so much site that's just amazing. Then you know also that voluntary, we agreed to not turn on some portion of the sites close to the airports, which is a smaller portion of the totality. I would say this is good progress. Everybody is focused. We have the highest assurance from the White House that this will be resolved very soon. I follow this person and myself. But again, it's a smaller portion of the network. The big thing is doesn't impact our business at the moment, meaning by customers that we can serve. But clearly, we want this to be resolved as soon as possible. So the pressure is on everybody involved to make this fixed. When it comes to fixed wireless access, you're right. I mean we have now, for a couple of years, learned all the way from billing, customer care how to work with fixed virus access. And I think that's a really good way for us to learn going into the second or into '22 when it comes to fixed wireless access. So of course, we have high ambitions internally for fixed wireless access and the team is really well prepared for it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: I was wondering if you could update us on the track phone integration. What are you seeing so far? And what are the opportunities in '22 and beyond, particularly the synergy realization, how does that flow into 2022? And then on the EBITDA, I know, Matt, you mentioned the $10 billion program and you continue to look at productivity, but how are you thinking about inflation presumably in retail stores, et cetera, you're facing some wage inflation. But how are you thinking overall about the ability to pull costs down in this sort of environment?\nHans Vestberg: Okay. I just need to correct myself. It's going so faster. So I said 90 million POPs covered with C-band. We have 95%, as I said, as of today. So I just wanted to correct that. My colleagues here comment that I didn't remember that. It's going fast for us here. On TracFone, when we talked about the integration. As we took this over end of November, the team is doing a great job together. What we are doing from the Verizon side is, of course, bringing our platforms, the network, the products, the experience in IT and all of that, that's what we're bringing. That's where we bring synergies. Then, of course, we're going to have these brands serving their market in their way and seeing that we coexist together with them. So that is really what is bringing out then is some investments in the beginning as we said. But over time, this should be a really good addition to us, and it will be incremental from the beginning. So I'm really excited with TracFone because now we serve the full market and being number one in that segment as well. So it just plays into the overall thinking about our five excise growth, having more places to grow than anybody else in the market, and this is just another vector for us. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So Simon, on your question around inflation, I mean the -- as you mentioned, we successfully completed our cost reduction program by the end of the first quarter, three quarters ahead of target. That really puts us in a great place as you think about inflation because we haven't stopped our work on continuing to get more efficient just because we hit the target but it really got that muscle developed and the teams continue to look at ways to improve our processes, make them more efficient and also improve both the customer and employee experience. So, the teams have continued strong targets in that space as we head into 2022. We all know inflation is out there and certainly we'll see some of that. The good news is that we have a good part of our cost base is tied to longer-term contracts, which means we're not necessarily going to see the full impact of inflation and at the same pace at other industries are seeing. But certainly, it's real. We'll take actions to address that. The guidance that we gave was based off our expectation for -- to see an uptick in inflation this year. And there's a number of levers we have if we can pull if the situation evolves.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nDavid Barden: I wanted to -- first question, I wanted to follow up just quick on Simon's question on TracFone. There's really going to be three phases, right? There's going to be the -- getting the handset cost into the hands of the non-Verizon wholesale customers. And then the second is going to be realizing the margin benefit for migrating those guys onto the network. And then the third piece is going to be kind of grooming those customers from the prepaid base into the postpaid. And so I was wondering if you could kind of agree or disagree with that and kind of give a timetable where we could start to maybe see those tailwinds in margins and postpaid phone nets merge. I think the second question I wanted to ask is, just as the fixed bars access becomes a bigger input to cable thinking about the competitive interaction between telco and cable. And it's not fixed for us acts only, it's fiber investments. They are also kind of putting a pincer movement on them. And given the maturity of the wireless business now, which has had extraordinarily low churn for a long time, now you're getting the kind of into year four. I think we just saw Comcast excite you start to offer $400 retention initiatives. Temperature level in cable versus wireless, in particular, is something of concern. Could you kind of -- maybe Hans give us your thoughts on how that's going to evolve and is it going to evolve in a rational way? Or do we need to be concerned? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I'll start with the second question, and then Matt will walk you through a little bit on TracFone. Yes, on the market, as I said before, I mean, we compete well in a competitive market, and we prepare ourselves for that. And we think our offerings, both on wireless and fixed wireless access, including Fios support, of course, is very strong. Ultimately, we have a different recipe than many others, the best network then we have all our partnerships that nobody else has. And finally, we have a great value proposition to our customer with mix and match where they can pick and shoes. So that's why we feel really good going into this year. And with everything we have been doing in the last couple of years, we know it's working. Our strategy is working here. And clearly, we have also the owners' economics on both wireless and broadband, which is different from anybody else basically, that we actually have this owner because we have built a network from the data center to the edge with commonality, testing type of equipment. And then at the edge, we decide what type of access points we have depending on customer and solutions. And then we give them different applications and bundles with Disney+, whatever or if there are other solutions and I think that's unique for us. We have created that in the last three years, and that's why we sit here right now and feeling, we're going to compete well in this market even though it's competitive.\nMatt Ellis: Hi, Dave, on track. So I think as you walk through the things you described there, certainly, over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, we'll have the ability to bring all of the TracFone base onto the Verizon network and those customers get that step up in performance that you would expect when they come over. So as you recall, roughly two-thirds of the track base was already on the Verizon network. The other one-third will get migrated there. The final piece you mentioned was about once you've migrated them over the ability to step them up to postpaid. And look, those customers that want to step up to postpaid, we'll be in a great position to do so. With, as Hans mentioned, the mix and match structure given the customers' options as they move over to postpaid. But the TracFone acquisition wasn't based on bringing the ability to move more people over to postpaid. We want to have the best prepaid propositions in the marketplace we can complement what was already in place with the owner's economics we have. And so, we are in best position today for customers that want to stay on prepaid. We're going to have the best offer for those that want to move to postpaid, we can do that, too and just very excited about the opportunities that we now have with full ownership of the TracFone brands.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: I want to go back to a topic from earlier in the discussion about what's embedded in the '22 guidance, specifically, what's the expectation for wireless postpaid industry phone growth in '22 and how that compares to '21? And how important is the industry growth in '22 in terms of volume for Verizon to hit the financial objectives that are set? And then just separately, Hans, you made a mention of the Macro mobile edge compute earlier. I'm just curious if there's an update to unpack the financial opportunities and contributions from that arena for Verizon.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, I'll start with the mobile age compute. No, as you have seen, we have a great progress on that. First of all, we have three different business cases on the same infrastructure again where the private mobile edge compute, where the public mobile is compute and we have private 5G network. That's what we're working on right now. And they are a little bit different use cases, of course, of all of them. Some are a little bit more B to B to C and some are really B to B. What we are doing right now is, of course, bringing all that live together with our partners, and we have the three largest web-scale players in the industry working with us on all of these. And suddenly, we start seeing with every announcement that you see in the market, if it's IoT solutions or Metaverse solution, I mean that's what we built the network in normal edge compute. So this year, I'm looking for taking many of our proof-of-concept together with large enterprises and application developers to commercial deals. If you would put it in timing, I would say the fixed wire access is a little bit earlier, as we said all the time. The mobility case is first on 5G, then fixed wireless access, and we talked a lot about that and then mobile edge compute. So, you're going to see more about us gaining and winning a lot of businesses because we are the only one in the market in the mobile age compute. So that's what you're going to see in '22. And then of course, we're going to build up our revenue base going into '23.\nMatt Ellis: Mike, on your first question around the guidance on the revenue. So specifically, is it from a volume standpoint, when I look at the business segment, we saw very strong performance by that group in the second half of the year. We're excited about the momentum they have. We assume that they will continue to perform strongly from Matt's standpoint into 2022. And as you heard earlier, expect them to be at least at the service revenue growth from '21 or above. So that will be driven by continued strength in SMB and Global Enterprise. And then on the consumer side, we assume that the switcher pool will continue to be constrained based on the activity in the marketplace. We will continue to be very strong in terms of customer retention, and we have the opportunity to step customers up. You saw us do that last year. And now we have the additional opportunities that come with that, with the new mix and match plans on C-band. So we have great opportunity there. But as I say, we assume the switch of pool will to show some limitations just because of some of the other activity out there. But even with that, we think we'll have very strong service revenue growth next year. And then, we bring fixed wireless access on top of that, as you think about getting into the back end of the year in subsequent periods. So very excited about the momentum that we see from a revenue standpoint.\nOperator: The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nGreg Williams: It's Greg Williams sitting in for Colby. Two questions, if I may. One is on your 2022 free cash flow. I realize you're not guiding to it, but with EBITDA guiding up 2% to 3% and CapEx, call it, $22.5 billion at the midpoint. We see free cash flow coming in around $20 billion to $21 billion. Obviously, the big bogey here is CapEx, the range could be up to $2 billion including C-band. Can you help us with the proper framework on the free cash flow set up in '22, the puts and takes, the working capital you mentioned working capital drag on 5G phones. What could that drag be? And your pension and how we should think about it? Then the second question just on rising rates. With the expectations of the 10-year eclipsing 2%, how do rising rates change your view on capital allocation and your leverage target? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: So thanks for the questions, Greg. So on the free cash flow for 2022, it starts with the strong cash generation from the business with the EBITDA, and you saw the EBITDA guide plus 2% to 3% driven from growth of the top line. That puts us in a good place. But I do expect we'll see working capital increase next year as we continue to support our customer activity, especially related to the device payment plans. Also as revenues and profitability increases, cash taxes have a nasty habit of increasing as well. So that will, of course, be in the CFFO. And then as you get down to free cash flow, as you mentioned, the CapEx will play in there. We said last year, we'd spend that incremental $10 billion over five years. We're going to see the biggest part of that come through this year. But you're also seeing the rest of the CapEx number being lower year-over-year, that range of $16.5 million to $17.5 million versus $18.2 billion, we've done not just last year but the last two years. So you'll see that come through. And really kind of linking that with your second question, but what you really see is our ability to execute across all parts of the capital allocation model, invest in the business with the -- not just the buying the spectrum, but accelerating the deployment of it, investing in TracFone at the same time, increasing the dividend for the 15th year in a row, continuing to strengthen the balance sheet. We said at the Investor Day last year, our leverage ratio would be about 2.9x at the end of first quarter with all the financing for the spectrum, and we'd be at 2.8x by the end of the year. We hit that target. So you see already coming down while doing that additional spend. So certainly excited about the opportunities that the cash generation of the business give us, and then as you think about rising rates, the team has done a great job of maximizing the debt portfolio. You see that in the interest expense. The majority of our debt is fixed rate. So it would take interest rates being at elevated levels for a long time period for that to flow through into our debt complex. So I think the way that we're managing the debt profile means that the rate environment will not cause us to change how we think about capital allocation model here. And certainly, we're focused on continuing to execute aggressively against all of the pillars of the model.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: I want to return to some of the comments you made about fixed wireless. How should we think about fixed wireless? Is it primarily an opportunity to generate revenue on the 5G platform because it's available? Or is it primarily a play toward convergence and selling a bundle of wireless and home access across not just your wireline footprint but across the whole country. And sort of on that latter point, how do you envision the sale evolving? Do you expect that a converged offering to households is going to become the norm for the industry?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you for the question. First of all, I think what we have designed this network and our go-to-market is optionality for our customers. If the market goes to more convergence, definitely, we will be there. We're going to be nationwide with broadband, and we're going to be nationwide with wireless. If a stand-alone business, we can do that as well because we have the scale right now, all the way from our network, to our capacity, to our IP, to our go-to-market, customer care, all the way we have scale. So we are just playing with the -- where the market is going and giving the optionality. The same goes for our content deals. I mean trying to see that our customers can pick and choose what they want and see if they want it. They can keep it or they can continue with it. So all in all, with our mix and match, our network, everything is set up for optionality of a customer choice. We are the Company that can give customer choice and then we have economies of scale in either of the solution. So if the market go converges, we're going to be there. If it's go separate, we're going to be there, and we're going to have economies both the -- and it will increase our leverage when it comes to profitability because this one network is one way to go to the market for us regardless of.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nPeter Supino: Two questions, if I could. Matt, I'd love to hear a bit more about the 2022 guidance for organic service revenue growth of 3% relative to EBITDA growing just a little bit slower. I'm wondering, where the deleverage is in the model for 2022 and when you might expect to see the operating leverage that you mentioned in your prepared remarks? And then Hans, just to follow up on Craig's question about fixed wireless access. You're in the last year using EDLP broadly in Fios and then providing 50% off of fixed wireless access for Verizon premium unlimited sub. And so, it seems like your marketing is behaving in a way that's very focused on driving bundling ratios. I'm wondering if you think that's the right interpretation, and if it is, when might you be more focused on pricing in the broadband business?\nMatt Ellis: Peter, so I'll start off with the -- taking a look at your question around the '22 guidance. So certainly expect wireless service revenue to have another good year starting with the momentum we have coming out of '21, both in business and in consumer. And then we add obviously to that bringing TracFone in and also with the C-band and the new mix and match pricing. So we feel good there. We would expect in the legacy wireline business to see the some of the secular trends that we've been experiencing for a number of years now continue, providing an offset in there and you see the impact of that also as you think about the profitability. But certainly, the 2% to 3% on EBITDA, we think is -- shows that the business continues to grow, continues to increase the cash generation. And as we bring C-band online and execute across all five vectors of growth, we have opportunities to see that margin line expand even further as subsequent years as we go here. So the margin growth, the cash flow growth across the business should continue to be strong not just in '22, but for a number of years out. Hans, do you want to speak to fixed wireless.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, I will answer on the fixed wireless. First of all, I think we have not changed our long-term strategy to be financial discipline when it comes to our customer acquisitions. We are focused on high-quality customers, and we will continue to do so. Our team is extremely methodical when it comes to do these offerings and see the long-term benefit for us and for the customer and what we give them. As I said, right now, in our fixed wire access, we have this bundle to see if that is what the market wants to have. But again, we have optionality with the pricing. We can do it standalone or we can do our premium on wireless. And I think all in all, again, we have ones economics on both of them. So, it should be possibly financially for us. And again, the team is very convinced that we have a really, really good formula here. And I have all the confidence in my consumer team, but don't forget the business team. The business team is doing fixed wireless actuals as well, and they're doing mobility as well, and they have a great opportunity. Again, we use our platforms, the long-term strategy we put in, in order to be using sort of the same type of solutions to our customer base and that we can scale and that's why we can the guidance we do right now for 2022 and feeling good about it.\nOperator: Your final question for today will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.\nTim Horan: Can we talk about the C-band build out a little bit more? On the $10 billion in total spend, will you have basically all your cell sites built with that is done? And will all the spectrum be online? And I guess that's the same question for the 95 million POPs. So you have most of the cell sites built in those locations and maybe what percentage of the spectrum is online? And then on the C-bank, can you give us an idea now that you're operating and what the increase in overall capacity is in latency maybe other measurements would be helpful.\nHans Vestberg: I'll let Matt start. Got so many questions...\nMatt Ellis: So on the C-band build, so look, certainly, we are not complete with coverage from a build standpoint with the initial $10 billion. The $10 billion is incremental. As I said, once we spend the $10 million ongoing C-Band bill becomes part of our BAU CapEx. And you heard our comments earlier around expectation for continued improved capital intensity. But certainly, within the $10 billion is helping us build out significant parts of the first 46 markets, the ones we got access to and turned on last week. And also begin the early build in the other markets that are scheduled be turned on in December of '23. So, we'll get a substantial part of the coverage for C-Band built with the $10 billion, certainly not the whole thing. But then as we do that, traffic moves off of the LTE network to our need to continue to spend on capacity and the LTE network comes down, that's how we'll continue to fund the C-band build going forward as a result of those other efficiencies. So hopefully, that provides a little more detail on the...\nHans Vestberg: No, the only addition I would do is, of course, that when it comes to this initial build, I mean the vast, vast majority is on sites we already have. We have said it before. It's the same grid as the 4G, which is great for us, how we do this. And then we have normal expansions over time, but that's nothing unusually CAU. When it comes to the performance of the C band, this is a perfect sort of cliffhanger. It's a little bit early. Of course, we're excited, but we have Investor Day 3 of March. And I think that if we tune in there, you'll probably get something about the performance on our C-band. But early into it, I'm really pleased what the technology team have done and our partners have done so far, but stay tuned for the 3 of March, and we will talk more about that.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Tim. That's a great way to end. Brad, that's all the time we have today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. As a reminder, we've entered the quiet period for the 3.45 gigahertz spectrum auction, so we will not be able to comment on our spectrum holdings or strategy. Now let's take a look at the consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.55 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported results include a net pre -tax gain on the sale of Verizon Media of $706 million and a net pre-tax charge of approximately $247 million, which includes a net charge of $144 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and $103 million related to severance charge for voluntary separations under our existing plans. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 in the third quarter compared to a $1.25 a year ago. Please note, our results include two months of Verizon Media as the sale to Apollo Funds closed on September 1st. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. We had a solid performance in the third quarter, growing total wireless service revenue by 3.9% year-over-year with earnings growth. This was supported by strong net additions in wireless and broadband, which are both translated to bottom line growth. This definitely confirms our strategy to grow our business with high quality offerings. As I've said throughout the year, we have all the assets we need to extend our number one position in the market. Our strategy remains unchanged and we're delivering on everything we promised, and we're gaining momentum on all of five vectors of growth. We have more paths to grow than anybody else and we're confident with our growth targets throughout the years based on our third quarter and continued momentum into the fourth quarter. As an evidence, we're updating financial guidance for the full year. We now expect total wireless service revenue growth of around 4%, which is on the high-end of our prior guidance, and adjusted EPS of $5.35 to $5.40, up from $5.25 to $5.35. We remain on track to achieve our targeted CapEx levels in 2021, assuming no further disruption in the supply chain. Our team is working diligently and doing a fantastic work with vendors and suppliers to ensure we have adequate equipment to meet our C-Band build and that we have devices that are customer want. Our operational excellence and our partnership strategy is the best in the industry, which I've been so impressed by since I joined Verizon. And in times like this, it matters. Let's talk about business. We continue to provide the best-in-class experience across the board. On the network front, third parties continue to recognize us as the best network experience. These includes RootMetrics for the 16th consecutive time and J.D. Power for the 27th consecutive time. Our network team is doing a great job. On the commercial front, we've got great momentum into five-year adoption, with over 25% of our consumer phone base using a 5G-capable device. This is tracking well ahead of the 4G adoption, as I've said before. For context, 12 months of the 4G launched, 10% of the devices were in 4G. Less than 12 months after 5G DSS launched, more than the double were on 5G devices and it's growing at a rapid pace. These combined with our millimeter-wave strategy is an important combination and that is paying off. In the third quarter, the total millimeter wave uses more than double sequentially. We're doing more gigabit of usage in a month now than we did in all the first quarter. In some or more established build-outs, we're seeing more than 20% of usage on millimeter wave. And we're on track to have 5% to 10% of all traffic in the urban millimeter wave polygons by year-end. For Business segment, we continue to add wireless subscribers and take broadband share in our ILEC footprint with Fios. And finally, we delivered significant value creation and strategy refinement with a sale of the Verizon Media Group in September, depending TracFone acquisition and also the issuance of our third green bond, which is a vital step towards our net zero goal in 2035. All this was accomplish in tandem with a strong quarter results. When it comes to the financials, we're on track to meet and exceed all of our 2021 guidance. We expect to have a strong finish of the year as we approach the launch of C-Band. We continue to deliver excellent revenue performance in wireless service and within Fios. We have a diversified path for revenue growth with all five vectors contributing. EBITDA was up 3.3% year-over-year. And on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 12.8%. Our capital allocation stands firm. We invest in our business to create shareholder value. We continue to increase our dividend, which we did for the 15 consecutive year. And Matt and team are working diligently on our debt reduction. As we said last quarter, our guidance race is broad-based and across all our five vectors of growth. Consumer segment EBITDA increased by 2%, driven by positive trends in customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services, and content, as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The service revenue momentum in the third quarter was driven by continued execution of our migration strategy to higher-valued price plans, as well as high-quality net adds. But our growth is more than that. Much of our long-term growth is in fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute. Our strategy is becoming a national broadband provider with the best access to the tech for our customers includes Fios, fixed wireless access on 5G, 4G millimeter-wave and C-Band. When it comes to the mobile edge compute, we are the mobile edge compute leader, both in public and private. Thanks for great partnerships. And we just announced a private mobile edge compute partnership with Amazon that we're pleased with. And this just scratches the surface on how we will continue to utilize our assets. We're confident in our growth opportunities as we move into the investment cycle with C-Band. Before I hand it over to Matt, I want to briefly touch on our broadband expansion. We're on track to meet our fixed wireless access household coverage targets with an expected 15 million homes passed by the end of the year between 4G and 5G. To date, five-year home is in 57 markets and the 4G LTE home in over 200 markets across all 50 states. In addition to fixed wireless access, we're pleased with the great performance or Fios and continue to grow the open for sales volumes within our footprint. We're on track on exceeding all the commitments for 2021 and on track for long-term growth expectations outlined in our Investor Day earlier this year. You can expect us to provide 2022 guidance during our Q4 21 earnings call. And now, Matt, over to you.\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to share our Q3 results, another quarter in which we delivered strong financial and operating performance. As we have said previously, our focus is not solely on volume growth as a goal in itself, but on high-value volume growth that will yield sustainable increases in revenue and profitability going forward. By delivering the best-in-class network experiences to customers with additional services and products like Disney+ that others can't provide, our strategy is focused on increasing the value we received from every connection. As you can see from our results, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. In the third quarter, consolidated total revenue was $32.9 billion, up 4.3% from prior year. Our results are inclusive of two months of Media revenue, which approximated $1.4 billion on a segment basis. Excluding Verizon Media, total revenue grew 5.5%. Our service and other revenue growth rate was 0.5% and 1.6% without Verizon Media. Equipment revenue growth was approximately 30% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the timing of iconic device launches and the continued pandemic recovery. Fios revenue was 3.2 billion up 4.7% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in customers, as well as our efforts to increase the value of each customer by encouraging them to step up in speed tiers. Total wireless service revenue, which is the sum of consumer and business, was $17.1 billion, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year. The results were driven by higher access revenue, volume growth, and products. We are creating more paths to growth with connectivity and non-connectivity services. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $12.3 billion up 3.3% from prior year. Top-line growth and a reduction in non-equipment related expenses contributed to the year-over-year EBITDA growth. And that EBITDA growth is helping us drive EPS growth. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was a $1.41, up year-over-year by 12.8%. Now let's take a look at our consolidated metrics. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on bringing in high-quality net adds, a key component in helping us continue to deliver strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We are seeing strong demand for connectivity across our consumer and business units. Our Mix and Match value propositions, network quality, and unique partnerships are resonating with both new and existing customers. For the quarter, we delivered 429,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net adds. up more than 50% from prior year and in line with 2019 levels. We're seeing growth in new accounts, as well as high retention levels, allowing us to grow our base with high-quality net adds, phone churn for the quarter was 0.74%, well below pre -pandemic levels. Churn continues to benefit from a number of sustainable factors, including our best-in-class network with unmatched reliability and coverage and overall value propositions within our consumer and business unlimited plans. Additionally, consumer payment patterns continue to be better than pre -pandemic norms. Total broadband net adds, defined here as Fios, DSL, and fixed wireless; were 129,000. Fios Internet net add were 104,000 compared to 144,000 last year. As a reminder, last year's 3Q Fios results included a benefit from a higher backlog entering the quarter, as we had largely paused installs in Q2 2020 due to COVID. Fios has continued momentum driven by our best-in-class value proposition, built on network quality, and our Mix and Match pricing structure. This combination is helping us to take share and deliver historically low churn rates. For the first time we're providing fixed wireless net adds, which include both consumer and business fixed wireless products. We are building momentum and our pre C-Band success in Q3 demonstrates there is demand for the product from consumers and businesses. Both our 5G and LTE fixed wireless products are performing very well. We're pleased with what we're seeing around the install process, as well as the quality and reliability of the product. Now, let's turn to our Consumer Group results. Our Consumer Group had another strong quarter, continuing the momentum that we've been seeing in wireless and Fios. Total revenue was $23.3 billion up 7.3% year-over-year. Service and other revenue was $18.8 billion, an improvement of 2.5% versus prior year. These results include strong wireless revenue, as well as growth in Fios. Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, up 4.3% year-over-year mainly driven by growth in our Internet base of approximately 400,000 or 6.2% over the past year and migration to higher speed. Our actions around Mix and Match, which include a broadband first approach is helping us to grow with Fios revenue and Consumer EBITDA. We still see plenty of room for additional growth within Fios as we continue to increase our share Mix and Match penetration rates and are open for sale locations. Wireless service revenue is $14 billion up 4% from the prior year. We have been driving access gains both in growing accounts and phone net ad, as well as by continuing to execute on our migration strategy. As a result of migrations and step-ups, over 30% of our account base is now on premium unlimited plans. Our growth in access is being complemented by product revenue, which includes items such as protection plans, content, and others. Our wide range of product offerings helps us to not only grow revenue, but provides differentiated experiences and more value to our customers. For the quarter, EBITDA was $10.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year or more than $200 million, driven by our high quality service and other revenue gains coming from multiple growth vectors. These results show the impact of our strategy to enhance the value of each connection, which we believe will drive continued growth into the future. The Mix and Match pricing structure for both wireless and Fios provides tremendous opportunity to migrate customers to higher-value tiers and bringing customers and higher value plans. We're very pleased with how this strategy is working to help us increase value from our base and from new customers. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout our results. Postpaid phone net adds were 267,000 above our Q3 performance in 2019 and 2020. the performance was consistent during the period, as we are able to grow accounts and deliver sustainably low churns throughout the quarter. Most importantly, we continue to be very pleased with the quality of customers we're adding. With approximately 66% of new accounts taking a premium unlimited plan. And Q3 was another quarter in which we saw a strong acceleration in our 5G penetration, exiting the quarter with over 25% of our phone base now equipped with a 5G capable device, which is great progress in advance of our launch of 5G service from C-Band spectrum in the coming months. Fios Internet net adds were 98,000 for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing, especially on retention. Now, let's move to Slide 11 to review the business group results. Our business segment continues to see strong demand for wireless services across multiple verticals. We are continuing to focus on what we believe will be the highest growth portions of the business segment, our small and medium business unit, private wireless, and the Mix space or enterprise customers, as well as building momentum for fixed wireless access to serve multiple customer groups. Total revenues for the business segment was $7.7 billion. We continue to see growth in wireless revenue being offset by ongoing legacy wireline declines. Wireless service revenue was $3.1 billion up 3.6% year-over-year. We saw quarter-over-quarter expansion driven by small and medium business, which was partially offset by distance learning prices in public sector. Wireline revenues continue to be pressured by secular trends, while also facing elevated year-over-year comps due to 2020 COVID spending. Consistent with our focus on driving high-value business, in the wholesale space we continue to rationalize our international voice traffic which is contributing to the revenue decline shown on the slide. Business segment EBITDA was $1.9 billion, down 2.4% from the same quarter last year, and business segment EBITDA margin was 24.8% in the quarter. While secular trends within wireline will continue to put pressure on margins in the near-term, we're encouraged by the growth opportunities associated with our business transformation efforts as they start to gain traction. Our market leadership in wireless across all customer groups and our continued investment in primary growth areas for Verizon Business Group will position us to take advantage of the growth opportunities in the future. We are encouraged by the results we delivered for the highest value portions of the segments in 3Q. Phone gross add volumes were above pre -pandemic levels, up 11.4% year-over-year and up 3% versus the same quarter in 2019. Total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 276,000. To better highlight some of the trends, on the slide we've broken out the net adds by public sector, and our higher-growth commercial businesses, which includes small and medium business and enterprise. During 3Q 2020, the commercial space primarily within small and medium business was suppressed. While public sector, buoyed by distance learning programs saw elevated net adds. In 3Q '21, we've seen a rebound in the commercial space, while distance learning disconnects have driven public sector volumes to lower levels. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. A portion of distance learning disconnects also impacted our phone churn and net add performance. Despite this, we delivered postpaid phone net adds of a 162,000. Now, let's move to our consolidated cash flow summary. The business continues to generate strong cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.2 billion. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by lower cash taxes last year from a onetime benefit and higher working capital requirements this year due to greater volumes. Year-to-date capital spending totaled $13.9 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the rates and capacity of our 5G ultra wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $1 billion through the third quarter, and we have placed orders for approximately $2 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us confidence that we will be within the previously guided incremental CapEx range of two to $3 billion for the year as we accelerate our C-Band deployment. The net results to cash flow from operations and capital spending is $17.3 billion of free cash flow for the 9-month period. Net unsecured debt at quarter-end was a $131.6 billion, a $5.2 billion decrease versus the prior quarter. In addition to our third green bond issuance, we extended over $4.6 billion of near-term debt into a new 2032 maturity. As we continue to optimize borrowing costs and our debt profile, our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.7 times. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion, which included the proceeds associated with our sale of Verizon Media Group. We expect lower levels of cash on hand as we progress through the fourth quarter and approach the close of the TracFone acquisition while continuing to execute on our business strategy within our capital allocation framework. Let's move onto Slide 14 for an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. We continued our strong first-half performance momentum in the third quarter. Hans and I are very pleased with the hard work our team is putting forth. And we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we prepare for the C-Band launch. Our strong year-to-date results and momentum heading into the fourth quarter are allowing us to update guidance on both wireless service revenue growth, and EPS. Wireless service revenue growth is now expected to be around 4.0%, the higher end of the prior guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is being increased to $5.35 to $5.40 up from the prior range of 525 to 535. Our guidance for the effective tax rate is unchanged. CapEx guidance is also unchanged. Though I'd note that our assumption for our BAU spend of $17.5 to $18.5 billion is dependent upon no material changes in the current state of our supply chain. Our team continues to execute on our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results. We are attracting high-quality customers that see value in our products and services, evidenced by growth in accounts, migrations, and step-ups. I look forward to continued momentum as we wrap up the year and position our base to take full advantage of all the things 5G Built Right has to offer. With that, I will hand it over to Hans to wrap up our prepared remarks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. As you heard, we delivered a solid third quarter results and we are on track to meet or exceed all our 2021 commitments to the investment community. Our strategy is working and I'm confident in the strategy we have to deliver both strong results and premium experiences going forward. As we look ahead, we continue to focus on expanding our 5G leadership, capitalizing on wireless momentum and work towards our C-Band launch, deploying differentiating experiences for our customers, and execute our network as a service to actually deliver all 5 vectors of growth, and we look forward to delivering on all fronts and sharing our results in the coming months. With that, I hand it back to Brady.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick : Hi. Thanks, guys. Hans, you discussed continued momentum into the fourth quarter and I see you recently pulled back on the more aggressive retention plans. Can you talk about what competition looks like in consumer right now, and any shift in underlying demand? And then second for Matt, given the strong performance in the recurring revenue businesses, does it makes sense to be less aggressive on reducing leverage and maybe allocate some free cash flow to buybacks given the low multiple on the stock? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Phil. Let me start with the competitive landscape. Yes, there is, of course, a little bit more competitive landscape right now, but let me remind you on a couple of things. First of all, as we have learned from the history, I mean, broadband and mobility is two of the most important infrastructure for any person in this country and in the world. So it\u2019s not strange that there is competition. Secondly, we're in a moment where 5G scaling, the economy is strong, so of course that's a moment where we see a lot of competition. But anyhow, if you look at our numbers, we are competing extremely effectively. We are gaining the high-quality customers regardless all the type of competition we have. Not only that, the money if you look at our growth of 3.9%, we feel really good about that as well. That won't come to our service revenue. And we have been going back and forth on our promos. And the reason is that Roman and his team on the consumer side, they look at long-term profitability, high-quality customers when they come in and doing a promo. And right now we feel very good about how we compete in the market. So we're always going to have promos when we think is the right timing of it. So we feel really good about it. And as we also saw that Matt talked about our increased guidance as well. So all in all, we feel good how we compete in this environment. And if you look at the track record, the last couple of quarter has been really strong in consumer and Ronan and the whole team are doing a great job, so I feel good about that. When it comes to the capital allocation, I'll let -- I can just say that we -- our capital allocation is clear. I mean, we focus number one, on investing in business and we are investing in the business this year and both in CapEx, the spectrum and all of that, so that's number one. But we also have, as I said, I mean, our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase and Matt and I, we constantly see that we have a position for the board, so they can continue to do that and we will continue to do that. And then we have our debt reduction, which Matt will talk about. And finally, we have buybacks that we can do all the time. What I can tell you is that we are going to have a conversation with the Board, which is the best way of doing capital allocation, the priorities and we\u2019ll continue to do so to see that our shareholders get the best out of Verizon. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah, Hans, I think you hit on the key points there. We're always going to look at the pillars of our capital allocation policy. And right now, we continue to see a lot of opportunities to invest in our business. You see what we're doing there around the C-Band investment, for example, not just the spectrum, but also the CapEx associated with that. Obviously, we said long-term, we do believe deleveraging is the right priority. But we're also focused on returning capital to shareholders, and you saw that with the dividend. So Phil, you should expect us to continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation as we go forward.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Phil.\nPhil Cusick : Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Good morning. Thanks so much for the disclosure on fixed wireless. That's great to see. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on the economics of the product. Is this a similar ARPU to a smartphone? Are we looking at mostly LTE, or is this a mix of LTE and millimeter-wave? And then perhaps just coming back to the C-Band, I think you said before 7,000 to 8,000 towers this year, getting to 100 million covered POPs by the first quarter. Perhaps, if you just update us on that and then how quickly do you really turn that into an expansion of your fixed wireless footprint as the marketing really start coincident with that, or is that a steady ramp during the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Simon. On the fixed wireless access, yes, you're right, it's a similar ARPU on fixed wireless access as on our mobility. And also, when it comes to the numbers we have, as you said, it's a mix of 4G, it's millimeter wave in the fixed wires access right now. And as I said before, when we talk about our 5G fixed wireless access, the usage on the network is very similar as on Fios. They're even using more gigabytes on the fixed wireless access on 5G than they do on Fios. So -and we have a very, very good performance and quality. Remember, on the fixed wireless access, we are also doing, I would say, a different model with the self-install and all of that, making optionality for our customers. And ultimately, the vision is clear for Verizon. We're going to be a nationwide broadband provider. We're going to have different accesses in different places depending on what is right for the customers and how quickly we can deploy. So - and we are investing in the Fios. You saw the numbers this month. I mean, we're adding 130,000 in this quarter -- or 129,000 to be exact net adds in broadband. So this is a great business for us and we\u2019re just ramping fixed wireless access and then coming back to C-Band. As soon as we turn on C-Band, we're also going to augment the footprint that we can offer fixed wireless access. So -- and as we said in the opening remarks, we are on track for that to deliver of the one-year having a 100 million POPs covered by the C-Band. As I said, there are some challenges in supply chain. But I can only say the team is doing an enormous work. And just to be clear on it, the long-term planning we have with our vendors, the projection or forecasting we have done for all our equipment vendors over two years before we start deploying, of course, is paying off right now that we worked very differently with our vendors and how we plan. We have also pulled resources and inventory higher in the network, so we can easily see that we have access to it. So we have done a lot of things in the last two years, three years in supply chain, so we can be in a situation to mitigate challenge as we have right now. So all-in-all, that's where we are. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes, Simon, I think Hans has summed it up well there. We've got good momentum in the fixed wireless business there. You saw the 55,000 net adds in the quarter. That means we're approximately 150,000 total subscribers on fixed wireless access at the end of the quarter, good momentum being built there. And as Hans said, as soon as we turn on C-Band, immediately be adding that to the technologies that we're selling on fixed wireless access. So good momentum buildup and then we've got that extra turbo booster come here in the next few weeks.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Many thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Brad, ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And just actually a follow-up here on your broadband business. You mentioned you're getting a mix of both LTE and 5G subscribers. I'm curious, who are these customers? Specifically, are you upselling into existing accounts or are these primarily new relationships for Verizon? And then, it's also notable that you are continuing to expand the Fios footprint. It looks like you're going to add over 400,000 locations open for sale this year and it seems like you would expect to be at or above that pace going forward. You really hadn't edged out that footprint for a long time. Why have you decided to do that now? How big could the Fios footprint be? And is all of this happening in your region, or are you actually doing some of this out of region? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. On the customers on fixed wireless access, I would say, they are probably roughly half and half. Half meaning coming from our existing base and half we\u2019re taking from other cost -- from other suppliers. That's basically how they're coming in right now. And let's see how the mix going forward. But here we have the optionality that we've talked about before and we have the owner's economics to work with convergence if that's what our customers want to have. We basically have all of those optionalities right now and I feel really good about that. And then the second question on the Fios footprint, we have constantly, of course, deployed Fios in this \u2013 in our ILEC to be honest. And what we see right now is very strong demand and we\u2019re winning the business. We're deploying -- the team is deploying, as I said, we're heading towards 400,000 open for sale this year and we will continue with that because we see a great demand and our win share is extremely strong in the Fios footprint.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So just a couple of things that are out there, Brett. On the mixture of the customers, as Hans mentioned, a good mix of 50-50 kind of split there between new and existing customers. But also our comment that a good mix -- a good split between not just it being in rural areas and so on, but also seeing good traction in suburban and urban areas, too, for those products. And when you think about those customers in the first 46 C-Band markets that will come online, that the customers taking the LTE product there are getting a router that also has C-Band in, so they could immediately step up to those speeds when - as soon as we turn C-Band on there soon. And the Fios expansion, it\u2019s - there's a couple of pieces. We see great opportunity, as Hans mentioned. The other pace it's a great cost opportunity as well, as we continue to upgrade the network technology in that footprint as well. So we've been investing in there for a number of years, maybe haven't spoken about it quite as much, but it continues to be a very good growth driver for the business. And we see very strong line of sight for it to continue to do so. 4.7% growth in Fios revenues this quarter, certainly something we can continue to build on.\nBrett Feldman: If you don't mind, as a quick follow-up there around the cost point. Those of us who live in regions that have Fios know that sometimes you can get Fios was maybe down the street. You can't -- are you kind of completing the communities? In other words, are you going to be at the point where you could finally rip out all this legacy infrastructure. Is that what you meant by the cost savings?\nMatthew Ellis: Right. That absolutely part of it. Now we're going to be all the way there, that's a long term goal for us, but certainly as you replace in a certain location, copper with fiber, there is a good benefit from a cost standpoint, in addition to the revenue step-up opportunities you get with that customer base. So it's a win-win on both sides of the P&L there.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Just a couple follow-ups again on the C-Band deployment. First of all, are you seeing any supply chain or labor shortage issues with that that may affect the timing of that roll out? And then beyond that, thanks for the 15 million home passed with fixed wireless by year-end. Can you give us a sense of what the C-Band deployment -- the sort of first phase of that? What that will do to that number? As that gets launched, do you turn on a number of more homes? And then lastly, can you give us a sense of how your go-to-market strategy will change it? And do you expect the C-Band deployment to change the trajectory of your net adds, both on a fixed and mobile basis when we see that early next year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: On the C-Band, as I said before, there are, of course, challenges in supply chain. But our team has -- I think our team is the most outstanding operation excellence team in the world and they are getting around all of it. On all major equipment, radios, et cetera, that's already secured. This is in a warehouse and that's how we work. I mean, we do long-term planning. with our suppliers years back, so we feel really good about that. There has been some challenges to meet material. the team is working around them every day, finding new solutions in order for us to deploy and they will continue to do so. When it comes to resources, again, we secured our resources year of ahead to be prepared for these types of deployment we have. We are doing more deployment than we have ever done before. You talk about C-Band, we do mmWave 14,000 this year, we do fiber, we do orientations on the 4G, we do Fios, the team -- so it's many things they're doing, and we have never done more than this and I can tell you the team with supply chain and deployment are doing a great job. When it comes to them, 15 million households passed by year-end this year, that includes all the technologies we have. And of course, the second part that we guided for when we had our Investor Day is what to get the 50 million households path later on. So that includes all the technologies, including C-Band of course, and also how we deal with different types of devices, having all the different technology in them. So the team has been planning this, creating opportunities for us. And of course, without coming into 2022 yet, but the opening of the C-Band, we see great new opportunities. And as I said, also, in Investor Day, that means that we can accelerate and amplify our business case on 5G. That was the whole day thing with the C-Band, and the team is geared up for that and very focused.\nJohn Hodulik: That's great. Thanks a lot.\nMatthew Ellis: So just following up on the bit about the open, the households cover. As you saw in the prepared remarks, we're 11.6 million at the end of the third quarter. Obviously, we'll continue to add some millimeter-wave and 4G for the rest of the year, but C-Band certainly will get us well over to 50 million as we turn that on.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, John. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to return Hans to the competitive landscape. I guess, year-over-year, I think most observers would say that the promotions kind of look very similar as they did a year ago. And if anything, the wireless landscape's probably less competitive now than it's ever been in terms of postpaid phone net add availability. And as we look ahead, I think the things that people wonder about what's going to change as the EBP, and the TPP, and the renovated programs all go away, the super-normal kind of sport for the postpaid market might ebb. And second, you've got the cable companies coming in with new pricing plans. And then third, we've got the dish launch coming up. Could you kind of give us your perspective on how comfortable people should be about how the landscape is going to evolve as these things change? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. A lot of moving parts there as you talk about. Again, I mean, I think that what we have -- and now, we start with consumer because remember also our strong position, wireless on the business side and basically we are leading in every segment, so sometimes we forget to talk about our strong areas. But let me start with consumer because I think your question is a little bit more geared to consumer. Remember how we have built our [Indiscernible]. First of all, we have the best network, we have kept the best network. We've augmented and we are, of course, adding more spectrum to it right now with C-Band, so that's very important. The second part is that the value we're doing besides having the best network, of course, with all the offerings we have created over time with Discovery, Disney Plus, which all of them are giving us profitability and retention. And you see the share numbers in this quarter. I think we have found the model with Mix and Match, and if things that we are offering our customers on the wireless side has really paid off with both the loyalty, but also the step-ups. And remember, when Matt talked about that's where I'm now, 1/3 of all the unlimited beyond unlimited premium. But we still have, let's say, 1/3 omitted plan as well. So we have so many steps to continue to move our customers upwards. And that has been a strategy from beginning, and it's clearly different than anybody else in the market, how we can do that. Both offered the best network and the experiences that we have, as well as the Mix and Match that we have in the network. So I feel good about the -- regardless of what type of competition is there and how it changes. We have owner's economics of everything we're doing, that was very clear from the beginning, we'll bring our own fiber, we have the full network and that's why we can have ebbs -- and windows on the network, which will also are benefiting from. So the whole idea with the strategy we laid out is just playing straight into what's happening in the market where mobility and broadband is the essential infrastructure for every individual in the world at the moment. And hey, everybody wants to be here. We have the best assets. That's basically how it looks.\nMatthew Ellis: There are a couple of other points, Dave, if I can. So you mentioned the EBBP impact on the marketplace and certainly, we're supportive of all efforts to make digital connectivity available and accessible to everyone in the country and we're participating in those programs. I would though say that in terms of our gross adds and new customers coming in, it's a very small portion of that. The majority of our EBBP participation is with existing customers rather than new customers. So it's not a driver of gross adds for us. And you also mentioned that obviously in the marketplace, there's been new plans that have come to the market in the past 6 months to 9 months. And what I would say is just look at the volumes we've had, especially in the last 2 quarters. Even with those new plans in place, you see the high-quality volumes that we've put on in that environment. So you have to look across both the service revenue and the handset components of the offering to customers. You add in the other values into products and services that we bring to customers too. This is the strategy we've been working on for 2 years to 3 years now. Obviously, it was a bit of a dip when we hit the pandemic, but the strategy was driving revenue growth before the pandemic and you see it driving revenue growth now as we continue to focus on high quality customers and increasing the value of our base, and it shows in the results.\nDavid Barden: And if I could just quick follow-up, Matt. As we look at the implied performance in business wireline, is a portion of that related to Verizon's willingness to be more aggressive on price and throw more elbows to hang onto customers knowing that those enterprise relationships are the groundwork for potential new wireless relationships as we think about enterprise 5G?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. No, I think there's a couple of items when you look at the wireline part of business revenue results for the quarter that are not related to what you mentioned. One, last year during COVID, we saw a little bit of a step-up in some of the cold voice data revenue that we hadn't seen in quite a while. We're now lapping that and those volumes are returning to their pre -pandemic trends. The other thing is we've stepped out of some of the wholesale international voice business that had revenue, but not significant margins associated with it. So we wanted to focus on value driving activities. We continue to compete effectively in the enterprise space in wire life. But on the quality and reliability of the service we provide, obviously we aim to be competitive there, but I'm not seeing us do anything out of the ordinary of what we were doing previously. And as you mentioned, those relationships are very important to us as we go into the 5G era and we've already seen those relationships payoff with the work being done, working through those opportunities in [Indiscernible] with a broad array of enterprise customers.\nDavid Barden: Great. Thank you, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Dave. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, I'm curious if you're seeing any impact s of the inflation on your cost structure and related to that, what are the opportunities and the specific products where Verizon could try to pass through any increase in input cost and get better pricing? Second question, just taking the reaffirmation today that Verizon wants to be a national broadband provider for homes, businesses, and on-the-go, how are you evaluating that build-versus-buy decision of using your spectrum in 5G technology to introduce to fixed wireless broadband services versus the possibility of acquiring cable and fiber assets in the future?\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the second question, Michael, as on the inflation. When it comes to our rollout on nationwide broadband and playing with that, of course, remember, we are doing a lot for fiber already right now. We're doing -- Remember, we have been reporting on our One Fiber project, which is still ongoing in the most metropolitan area we're building fiber and of course, that is setting us up to have it all this economics on the broadband and then at the access point, we will do a different type of 4G access. That's what new -- the reason we do that because there's so much after when it comes to coming out to the customer, and we want to be innovate as well and having a self-install and all of that combined with it. That we're always on our fiber when comes on the outside our island, we have looked into buy versus build all the time. We have come to the conclusion we want to build, we built our own fiber network because we want the owner's economics on fiber so that work is already done. So we feel really good about it. We're going to have wireless economic nationwide on broadband over time here. And we can work with our wireless offering, our broadband offering. We, we created the two go-to-market Verizon Consumer and Business Group thinking about our customers, how they do products, how to do platforms, the user experience. This all comes into play right now and I couldn't be more excited on that right now because the momentum for mobility and broadband is happening. We have prepared and worked now for 3 years to get where we are and we -- I feel really good about what we have and the strategy is really working. Look at the last couple of quarters here when we talk about our net additions, talk about the revenue growth. And as I also said, when we spoke earlier, I mean if you look at the second quarter when everybody has reported, we also take the largest share of industry service and all revenue growth in the market. I mean, that's really what we're focusing on. We're focusing on getting the revenue growth. And that's a little bit of the answer to your question on inflation as well that Matt is going to soon take over, of course. We still have a lot on the wireless side where we can migrate customers up to higher plans, and that's of course the best way to see that we are getting incremental revenues from our customers, but also give them more value and experiences.\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. Mike, certainly, we are seeing inflation in our business here. How long that lasts, obviously, we're going to have to wait and see and we're all monitoring that closely. But we're seeing that come across certainly in labor rates, we're seeing in commodities, driving utilities and whatnot. So -- but that's why the things we've done on the cost side over the past few years and continue to do are so important because it gives us the opportunity to be able to handle those -- any of those prices coming in and continue to produce good margins. So we will continue to be focused there. And then as Hans said, our opportunity on the pricing side is really to step customers up. If you've got direct cost out there that we can pass through that we certainly will always look for the opportunity to do that. That's why you see the changes in our content model from the legacy linear model, where there wasn't clear transparency to the consumer between the increase in the cost from the producer there to what they were paying. What you've seen, what we're doing in the wireless space with content, gives a lot more transparency. So as costs go up, it's much easier for those to flow through to the end-user.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Mike. Brad, we're for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First, you're starting to talk more about access. They disclosed more on fixed wireless, which we appreciate, but you've also talked about the other 5G growth applicant being Mobile Edge Computer, MEC. When will we start to see that show up in the numbers and actually start positively contributing to growth and where -- what line items would you point to where we will be able to see that? And then secondly, Hans, you mentioned that next quarter we should expect to see 2022 guidance. Just curious if your views on the metrics that you're focusing on might change, you're going to be seeing incremental headwinds, particularly the EPS, tied to some accounting. I believe on the spectrum. Just curious if you believe guiding to EBITDA and or free cash flow is something that might become more important when we see that guidance for next year. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Great question, Colby. First, on Mobile Edge Computer, first of all, we're doing a great progress in Mobile Edge Computer and you've seen that we're made announcements in the quarter with the biggest cloud providers in the market, both on the private 5G Mobile Edge Computer. And as you remember, there are basically 3 use cases. One, is the public Mobile Edge Computer, and then it's a private Mobile Edge Computer, and then it's private 5G networks. All of them are in execution right now. We're working with customers. We have announced a couple of commercial contracts already, like coordinating the British fort, etc. So that's already happening. And, And of course it takes some time because we are actually creating a total new market, and we're actually alone in this market. Nobody else in the world has launched mobile edge compute at this moment. So of course, we feel really good about that. And the team is working through the funnel all the way from proof of context to new applications. And that's how it works, when you create new markets, etc. So we will come back as soon as we feel it's time to start reporting it as we're have done with five-weeks fixed wireless access, but even more excited or the Mobile Edge Computer what I've seen the last year here with the technology solutions we have, and also the customer interaction we have together with the main partners. I mean, we have the biggest partners you can ever think about in this that are equally much invested as us, because that was part of the strategy to bring different parties. We have there, so we will continue with that. And we will come back and report, and we will give you new deals and how all this is progressing with partners over time and ultimately, of course, it's going to be financials and that's going to show up. Initially, of course, it's going to be on Verizon Business Group that's going to have that as revenue. The rest would be to see opportunity longer term, which can end up in consumer but predominantly in the beginning is a Verizon business group opportunity. Matt on guidance, have you thought through what you're going to do next year? He hasn't told me yet.\nMatthew Ellis: Colby, great question. So obviously we'll get into guidance at the next call. But as you mentioned, we always look at what year-over-year pressures maybe in there, especially things that are accounting-related rather than cash flow-related. We'll make sure we have the appropriate level of transparency around that. The important thing for us to be out there demonstrating that guidance is how our strategy is working and it's going to show up in revenue growth and cash flow growth. And you see that this year we'll find a way to make sure that we can communicate clearly that we're continuing to grow the top-line of the business and it's flowing through into the cash generation of the business as well, which is ultimately what it's all about.\nBrady Connor: Great.\nColby Synesael: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Colby. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. Two questions, if I could, both sort of at a strategic level, Hans. First, maybe you could just update us on your expectations for -- what exactly do you do differently when you get the TracFone asset? How do you think about the go-to-market strategy in the prepaid market in particular? And then second, you've started to see some of the whether it's Opensignal or other reports suggesting that T-Mobile's network for 5G is faster and broader coverage. How do you think about maintaining the best network advantage that you've had? And what gives you confidence that you can convey that in the business and consumer markets?\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the second one. First of all, we rely on the RootMetrics because that's the most sophisticated and scientific way of measuring the network, and it's -- we're undoubtedly the leader there. And without going into my competition because I never talk about them, but clearly one is always lost. So if we're done talking about TracFone, which is of course an exciting opportunity for us, which is still to be closed. We're not -- we don't have the go-to-market and the brands that TracFone have. They are so good on prepaid, and they've showed that. But at we will, of course, support them with these all the back-end support, all the way from supply chain, IT support, UX customer care, and all of that. But clearly, we want to keep the points of sales. We want to keep the offerings, and we want to serve the value market. That's where we are. I cannot go further into that because we still have the pending approval of it, but we will give you even more color, Craig, as soon as we have closed this one.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Craig. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Maybe a longer-term question. When we look at your growth algorithm on the consumer side, You have essentially an ARPU -- an upper growth trend line as well as revenue trend-lining, which is trailing [Indiscernible]. Probably continue as you deploy C-Band. And then as your [Indiscernible] increases, G&A should also pick up as we head into next year. And then there is the competitive backdrop which potentially capture [Indiscernible]. When you think about this growth algorithm, how do you keep margins impact when your revenue growth is essentially trailing?\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Can -- you broke up there but I think what you were trying to ask is how do we think about margin profile as ARPA trails the service revenue growth? Matt, your thoughts?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. So work in our team, we have tremendous opportunities and you see it come through in the results we've delivered now for a few quarters. So the ability to bring high quality customers in and then step them up. So the step-ups give us the increase in ARPA. And then the service revenue is obviously a combination of the increase in revenue within the base. And then also the impact of the new customers coming in. So as you do that, we're very, very confident that you continue to add scale to our business, which is already the best-in-class from a scale standpoint and that will show up in the margin profile of the business going forward. So I expect us to continue to have a very strong margin profile going forward. It's built on executing the strategy. You see that in the results this year. You compare the consumer margin in 3Q this year to two years ago, you see that strategy is working and delivering results at both of the top-line and the margin line.\nBrady Connor: Perfect. Yes.\nKannan Venkateshwar: [Indiscernible]\nBrady Connor: Kanaan, we're having technical difficulties with you. We'll have to catch up later. Thanks.\nKannan Venkateshwar: No problem.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Brad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Can you give us a little more color you mentioned there was a split in the fixed wireless, the team, the consumer and business. How is that shaking out? And then on the business side, it's still a little bit weaker there. Is that just continued pricing pressure in the market or is it a share issue or walk us through how you're looking at the enterprise space going forward.\nHans Vestberg: I talked about the fixed wireless access on the business side. It's called BCC Internet on that signed offering we have. And of course, we started off with our fixed wireless access on the consumer side, and we later on added in our business to actually have access to it. That's why because that's what we want to restart. I wouldn't say we have really good traction on the business side on fixed wireless actions, small and medium businesses. clearly where we have our stronghold, and we're being the clear leader. So we see this as a great opportunity for our Verizon Business Group as well. And again, we are now adding products and solution for Verizon Business Group that over time should offset the wireline decline that we have that Matt talked about. When we talk about the Verizon Business Group, I haven't talked enough about them, but the momentum on wireless there is really good. Look at it, small and medium business are coming back. They're doing a great job. On the enterprise side, the wireless business is doing well as well. The only area is the public sector that's coming a little bit back, but that's a very natural thing because the increased demand of home education and etc. During the COVID, of course, had a spike in wireless connections, which you see is naturally coming down a little bit right now. But the momentum on the wireless side, on the Verizon Business Group, and then you add the new opportunities, everything from application on top of the network, the Mobile Edge Computer, the fixed wireless access. And over time, more so opportunities outside the ILEC on vials, or at least on fiber. So that's a great opportunity for us, and that's what we outlined already in 2019 when we decided to transform that business to see that we are really well prepared for capturing those opportunities and those transformations that all the enterprise will need and companies will do to digitalize over time. So I think we're in a good place. [Indiscernible] team are doing a great job.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Frank. That's all the time we have today for questions. Thanks for joining the call and everybody be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-07-21 14:00:22", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.40 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a net pre-tax gain from special items of approximately $182 million, consisting of a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.3 billion related to a pension remeasurement credit, as well as a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion from early debt redemption costs. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.37 in the second quarter. In May, we announced an agreement to sell Verizon Media to Apollo Funds with an expected close date in the second-half of 2021. Upon the announcement, certain assets of the Verizon Media business were classified as an asset held for sale. As a result, we no longer depreciate or amortize these assets, which resulted in a partial quarter benefit of $0.03 per share in the second quarter, and this benefit will continue until the deal closes. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. It is remarkable the difference a year can make. We're quickly resuming pre-pandemic norms and at Verizon our network and in-store traffic is almost back to pre-pandemic volumes, and our office employees are gradually going back to office. Of course, some behaviors are changed permanently. The mass shift toward online activity, speed up the timeline for work from home, distant learning, banking, entertainment, telemedicine, et cetera. All of these societal and behavioral shifts have had an impact on the business. And they reaffirm our network as a service strategy and our focus on delivering on our five vectors of growth. Finally, after a year of virtual meetings, I've been spending time in the field with customers and partners, and importantly, with our frontline workers, who have done such heroic work throughout the past year serving our customers. All-in-all, we\u2019ve a very enthusiastic and cautiously optimistic stakeholder base. As we conclude the first-half of 2021, I have to say, I'm extremely proud of the achievements we have made to strengthen Verizon in all aspects. Let me mention a couple of the milestones. We strengthened our strategic focus with our divestment of Verizon Media Group, which we believe will close around the end of the quarter. We invested in the best portion of the C-Band in order to accelerate and amplify our multipurpose network as a service model. We have also improved our 2.0 organizational structure, and we brought in a diverse slate of top leaders. Our finance and treasury team did an outstanding job of strengthening our balance sheet, with low cost of borrowing and maturity for our debt. We also laid out a long-term financial goal with focus on growth. All this focus on strategy execution and to deliver profitable growth by our teams have paved the way for a continued great financial performance. And in the second quarter, we not only generated our strongest earnings on record, we also produced good growth and profitability in all our units and segments. We demonstrated continued strength in a wireless service revenue growth. And combined with our scale and operational efficiency, we produced 5.6% adjusted to EBITDA growth. Given the strength on our first-half results, we're raising our full year guide, and Matt will provide details later in the call. When it comes to our operations, our recent investments in our customers through the biggest 5G upgrade promotion and innovative trading, coupled with a mix and match for both wireless and Fios customers had led to strong performance across both our offerings. On the network side, we just continue to offer our customer the industry's best network experience. For the 16th consecutive time, RootMetrics awarded Verizon the best overall network performance. And for the 27th consecutive times, JD Power named us the number one network quality. Our C-Band build, we're on track to build 7,000 to 8,000 sites by year-end, and we're on plan to launch the first 46 markets. And we're also strengthening our network by expanding our fixed wireless access reach. If we look to the traffic in the network, the customer activity is near pre-COVID levels. And as mobility traffic comes back, we've seen mmWave uses increase 290% June year-to-date. And as we continue to deploy mmWave sites, and we add more device penetration, we expect these numbers to continue to increase fast, and track towards 5% to 10% of traffic in most dense urban areas by year-end. We're making progress in executing across all our five vectors of growth. On the 5G adoption, approximate 20% of our wireless phone base are now on 5G devices, with a majority of them C-Band capable. In the second quarter the step-up rates were very, very healthy, and this reflects value and differentiated experience for our customers. We also had a record high new accounts that opted for a premium unlimited plan. The Next Generation business application, we launched the first commercially available private 5G network solution in the U.S. It's an on-site, private 5G that brings on-premise 5G capabilities to large enterprises and public sector customers. The team in Verizon business group continued to make very important partnerships, and one of them in the quarter was with Mastercard, where we will work together with Mastercard on 5G Mobile Edge Compute, transforming the contactless payment for consumer as well as small and medium-sized businesses. The customer differentiation that we continue to develop further strengthened in the quarter, when new content and experience to our mix and match platform with a broken device trading, the biggest upgrade ever promotion. And we'll also add through partnership content with Apple Arcade and Google Play pass. Expansion into new markets, we have been focusing continue to have broadband nationwide, and we expanded our 5G Home Services, which is now available across 47 markets. On the 4G home, we expanded to more suburban and urban areas. And it's now available in parts of all 50 states. At the same time we launched a new home router which is compatible with the C-Band. Finally, we have recently expanded our 5G business internet also to parts of 42 cities. In summary, our strategy is working, and it's more relevant than ever, driving value for our investors and to our customers and society, as they embrace new ways of living and working. We have great momentum on all five vector growth, delivering on profit growth with alignment for long-term growth targets. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to, Matt, to discuss the financial results.\nMatthew Ellis: Thank you, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were exceptional, both financially and operationally. We continue to execute on our strategy, driving contributions from all five growth vectors. We attracted new customers and accounts and delivered low churn amid strong upgrade activity, all of which serves to accelerate 5G adoption in advance with our C-Band deployment later this year. Accelerating volumes contributed to another quarter of strong sequential wireless service revenue growth, building off our industry-leading performance in recent quarters. At the same time, our disciplined approach is driving profitability and strong earnings results. Let's go through the details beginning on Slide 6. In the second quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $33.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year. Service and other revenue rose 5.7%, driven by strength in wireless, Fios and media. Equipment revenue rose 47.6% year-over-year, given COVID impacted sales a year ago, and was up more than 17% from second quarter 2019 levels, driven by healthy upgrade activity. Total wireless service revenues were up 5.9% year-over-year, and 4.0% compared to second quarter 2019. The results represent sequential growth of $139 million, nearly double our industry-leading sequential growth reported in the first quarter. Total Fios revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year, driven by continued broadband subscriber growth. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion grew 5.6% over the prior year, in line with our service and other revenue growth, despite absorbing approximately $60 million of incremental tower lease costs related to the updated agreements to accelerate the deployment of our C-Band spectrum. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.37, the best on record. The execution of our strategy is translated into record earnings results, and we are well-positioned to continue the momentum into the second-half of the year. Now, let's review our operating segment results, starting with consumer on Slide 7. Momentum built throughout the quarter, and we timed our promotions to take full advantage of the economic recovery and increased customer activity. The result was one of our strongest net new wireless account quarters. With stores fully opened and consumer behavior closer to pre-pandemic levels, we delivered 1.7 million of postpaid phone gross ads in the quarter, up from 1.2 million in second quarter 2020, and almost identical to 2019 levels. Phone churn of 0.65% remained favorable throughout the quarter, and benefited from new offers in the marketplace. This result was a record low for a non-COVID impacted quarter. As a result of phone net ads of 197,000 were our best second quarter for consumer. The response to our differentiated customer proposition, including the broken device trading, and the biggest upgrade ever promotion was terrific. Device upgrades, which was significantly higher compared to both second quarter 2020 and 2019, drove 5G adoption and step-ups to premium unlimited plans, a strong indicator that our strategy is working. We exited the second quarter with approximately 20% of our phone base using 5G capable devices, with the vast majority supporting C-Band. In addition, step-up rates were historically high, and nearly 60% of new accounts opted for a premium unlimited plan, a record high. At quarter-end, approximately 69% of our account base was on unlimited plans, with nearly 27% of our account base on premium unlimited plans. The quality and reliability of our Fios service, combined with the simplicity of our mix and match offerings continues to drive strong demand for broadband. Fios internet net ads totaled 92,000 in the quarter, supported by strong customer retention, and our Fios internet customer base is more than 7% higher than a year ago. Our trailing 12-month total Fios internet net ad performance is the highest since 2015. Now, let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the consumer financial performance. The improved customer activity translated to impressive top-line trends. Total revenue for the quarter grew 11.2% year-over-year, and was also 6.7% higher versus second quarter 2019. Equipment revenue was the biggest driver, rebounding above pre-COVID levels from higher activations, aided by our customer value proposition. Wireless service revenue momentum translated to 5.4% year-over-year growth, and 2.5% growth compared to second quarter 2019. Service revenue is driven by customer growth, step-ups, products such as content, as well as reseller and prepaid. This growth comes despite minimal contributions from international roaming, which we expect should provide a further uptick to growth in future quarters. Momentum in Fios continues with revenues of $2.9 billion, surpassing pre-COVID levels, driven by the continued uptake of gigabit speeds. The results represent our highest revenue results ever. We remain encouraged by the continued margin improvement within Fios, driven by the adoption of mix and match plans and a greater contribution from broadband. Consumer segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 4.9% over 2020, representing an EBITDA margin of 44.3%, down from the prior year, primarily resulting from higher activations. Now, let's move to our business segment on Slide 9. Business wireless activity was highlighted by postpaid gross ads of 1.2 million, up 6.3% over the second quarter 2020, and up 2.1% over the second quarter 2019. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.07%, up 17 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated disconnects from COVID-related purchases in 2020, particularly within the education vertical of public sector. As schools plan for more in-person learning this fall, we expect disconnects to remain elevated in public sector in the third quarter. Despite the disconnect pressures, phone net adds was strong at 78,000, with improving trends in both SMB and enterprise, both of which posted their strongest phone net ads in over a year, offset in the disconnects in public sector. Let's now move to Slide 10, to review the business financial performance. The business segment delivered strong top-line growth with total revenue up 3.7% year-over-year. Equipment revenue, which is up approximately 47% was the primary driver of the increase. Wireless service revenue growth of 8.0% was driven by strong momentum in small and medium business, and the first quarter of enterprise growth since the onset of the pandemic. Public Sector continue to show strong growth over 2020, though is pressured by COVID-related churn in education. The wireless strength was partially offset by declines in business wireline, which returned to a more normal trajectory after elevated COVID-related demand. Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% in the quarter, down approximately 210 basis points year-over-year, mostly driven by higher equipment volumes and wireline pressure. While pressures likely persist in the near-term, the economic reopening, business transformation initiatives and 5G for enterprise provide opportunities to drive margin. Now, let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continued its recent trends and delivered strong performance, driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up approximately 50% from a year ago, and up 13% from second quarter 2019. Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the first-half of 2021 totaled $20.4 billion, compared with $23.6 billion from the prior year. The change was primarily driven by higher cash taxes and higher working capital requirements due to greater volumes. The cash tax impact was a result of a one-time benefit received in the second quarter of 2020, as well as COVID-related postponements of payments in the year ago period. These expected headwinds were offset by our strong operational results. Capital spending for the first-half of 2021 totaled $8.7 billion, as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G ultra wideband network. C-Band CapEx was more than $160 million in the first-half, and we have placed orders for approximately $1.4 billion of related equipment year-to-date, giving us a confidence that we will be within the previously provided $2 billion to $3 billion range for the year. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first-half of the year of $11.7 billion. During the quarter, we began to normalize our cash balance closer to the pre-pandemic levels given the macro environment, and we ended the period with $4.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a sequential change of $5.4 billion. We exited the quarter with unsecured debt of $141.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $6 billion, as we continue to focus on optimizing our debt footprint. Our total borrowing costs in the second quarter were $1.4 billion, which was relatively flat to second quarter 2019 levels, despite having approximately $40 billion in additional debt this year. Net unsecured debt at the end of the first-half was $136.8 billion, and our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9 times. Now, let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. Our strong first-half performance and the momentum in our business gives us the confidence to raise guidance. Please note, that the updated guidance reflects the planning assumption that the Verizon Media sale closes at the end of the third quarter. Starting with revenue, we are raising our wireless service revenue growth outlook to 3.5% to 4%, up from the prior 3% plus. The drivers of the revised outlook are broad based and include positive trends we are seeing for customer acquisition, premium plan adoption, products and services such as cloud and content, as well as prepaid and reseller growth. The anticipated timing of the Verizon Media sale means we would not recognize any revenue from that business in the fourth quarter. As a result, service and other revenue is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with 2020, and we are withdrawing that growth guidance at this time. Turning to earnings, we now expect an adjusted EPS range of $5.25 to $5.35, up from the prior range of $5 to $5.15. The increase is driven by the improved wireless service revenue outlook, the aforementioned media DNA benefit, and a reduction in the expected interest expense related to the C-Band investment. Our guidance for the effective tax rate and CapEx were unchanged. In summary, we're competing effectively and delivering strong volumes, growing accounts, driving healthy step-ups and positioning our base to capitalize long-term, as we grow 5G adoption. Our customer performance has led to quality financial results, as demonstrated by the sequential wireless service revenue growth, while also flow into the bottom line with best on record adjusted EPS. We entered the second-half with a lot of momentum, and I am confident we will continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational and financial results, throughout the remainder of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our priorities for the remainder of 2021.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. At our Investor Day, we laid out commitments for 2021 and beyond to scale our network as a service strategy and generate GDP plus growth. We made transformative investment over the last 12-months through acquisitions, divestiture and customer innovation, and creating a strong platform for growth in the second-half of 2021 and beyond. Our priorities for the second-half, continue to build on our current network and customer initiatives to further amplify and accelerate 5G adoption, further cement our network leadership through industry-leading mmWave and C-Band assets. We expect to close our TracFone and VMG transaction later this year, increasing our focus on what we do best, and bringing innovation and best-in-class customer experience to the value segment. And overall, drive growth across our five vectors with disciplined and customer focused execution. At the end, the great transformation in the first-half, we competed very well in the marketplace, and we're very confident and excited on our opportunities ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brady for the Q&A.\nBrady Connor: Thank you, Hans. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Sir, please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Yeah, thanks for taking the question, and two if you don't mind. First, I just want to go back to some of the color Matt was giving on the improved outlook for wireless service revenue growth this year. At the high-end, that's actually a pretty significant improvement. I know you outlined a number of things that were behind it, but I was hoping you can maybe just dig into that a bit more. I'm particularly interested in what you're doing to outperform as it relates to plan mix? And then are you seeing a return of any of the fees that had come out of the run rate last year? Is that something you've seen already? Or, is that embedded in the outlook? And then, just on the improved EPS guidance, if we just sort of look at the $0.03 benefit you got from moving away from the DNA media in the recent quarter, that would imply that the improvements your outlook this year maybe captures $0.07, $0.08, just from that accounting shift with the rest of it being operational. But if it's more nuanced than that, I think we all appreciate that insight. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I can start and Matt will fill in. But I think that on the service revenue, I think you've seen the last four quarters right now how the team has done a fantastic job to differentiate our offerings, all the way to see that our customers are doing step-ups, they're taking down limited premium. And as Matt said, there have been 60% of the new accounts in the quarter was taking a limited premium. The penetration 5G is happening. So we just continue -- the team we\u2019re growing on the consumer side, if we talk about that. They have these more than we've added for several years, where we do the mix and match. We have a differentiation and it is clearly resonating in the market. And at the same time, we see, of course, they call them and calling back, the stores are getting almost back to pre-pandemic. So, all in all, it's a good timing for us and that's also why we feel good about our guidance, and how the service revenue is growing. And remember, we're always focused on profitable growth. That's what the team is doing. If Matt and I see opportunities, we support the team to do it, but as long as it's going to be a profitable growth. And that's what we're seeing right now, with all the momentum in the market. The team is taking advantage of that. And that also translates back to the guidance. But, all in all, I would say this is our strategy, we've been having for a couple of years and has been very successful. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. Thanks, Hans, and thanks for the question, Brett. So, starting with the question about wireless service revenue growth, and as Hans mentioned, it's really building on the momentum that we've seen in the first-half of the year. The continuation of the sequential service revenue growth, we saw that the prior couple of quarters, we saw that increase even further, in the second quarter. We expect that trend to continue as we get into the second-half of the year, because of the operational momentum that Hans mentioned, more step-ups to higher price plans, et cetera, et cetera. In terms of the fees, obviously, the year-over-year component is rather unique this time, as second quarter last year was the most heavily impacted by COVID. And more specifically, for us, of course, we had to keep Americans connected pledge that was in place for all of the second quarter that as you said, impacted some of the fees. As you think about the numbers this year, a good chunk of those are back in. We're more at a BAU level. A couple of items, though that aren't in the numbers yet, obviously, international travel is not back to anywhere close to pre-pandemic levels. I don't expect that to be there, for the balance of this year. Hope there'll be a tailwind as we get into next year, but the guide doesn't make any assumption about an acceleration over return of those fees in the second-half of \u201821. One other thing I\u2019d draw attention to as well, when you look at our numbers, and you think about return of fees, one of the things has been very strong in the first-half of the year is customer payment patterns, which is a great thing to see. And certainly, with all the stimulus payments out there, there's a lot of money in the system, and customers are actually paying more frequently. So, even though, we're back to normal in terms of things like late fees, we're actually charging significantly less than we were in second quarter of \u201919, because more of our customers are paying on time at this point, which is certainly a trend that we're very happy to see. So, some of the fees are back. But not all of them are back when you think about it. And we're not assuming they will be back in for the balance of the year. The guide is based off of the strong operational momentum in the business, customers stepping up to those higher price plans, and we see that momentum continuing. Your second question about the EPS guidance, and obviously, glad to be able to raise the guidance that's based off having a very healthy business that is performing exceptionally well. As you mentioned, some of the upside to the guidance comes from the media depreciation, amortization, probably about $0.06 to $0.08, depending on the timing of the close. But the majority of its coming from cash items, whether that be the wireless service revenue guide, we were just discussing, but also related to improved expectation around cash interest expense, lower than anticipated at the start of the year. So, most of the guide is driven by cash-related items, and that's of course, based off the strong momentum you see in the business, both operationally and financially.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for that color.\nBrady Connor: Great. Yeah. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just question on the upgrade rate, obviously, it's up not just year-over-year, but even over the \u201819 levels. Do you expect that trend to continue and maybe even accelerate as we move into the second-half of the year? And then, if you could comment on the impact on margins? I would imagine that, it helps incentivize people to move into those higher price premium plans. But the higher mix of equipment revenues may put pressure on margins. So, just how you foresee the sort of margin trends in the second-half as these volumes built would be great? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. As I said before, we have this formula right now that we've had since we launched unlimited, with both mix and match, and then our value proposition that we have done. And you saw in the second quarter, that now we added also gaming with good traction with both Google and Apple gaming. And this is a unique model for us. At the same time, of course, we have excitement around 5G, what we have in our network is performing extremely well. So, I think that our team, they have a very, very good model for continuing this. I think, I said it in the first quarter, it will become more of this value proposition and differentiation. And yes, it came, we went into gaming. So, I say it again, I have a lot of confidence in the team in Ronan's team to continue to come up with things that our customer loves, and using our distribution, our network and a brand to continue to grow this. And that is the whole strategy. Remember, the five vectors of growth, we\u2019re playing in all five of them, and that's why we are also confident all of our long-term guidance without a doubt. And you see part that in this quarter that we already are executing on all of these vectors.\nMatthew Ellis: Hey, John. So, as you mentioned, obviously, the higher mix of equipment revenues shows up in the margin percentage. But, I think you also have to look at the margin dollars, which are up sequentially, and also up significantly year-over-year. So, very happy with that performance at the margin line. As you say, when we have a higher equipment revenue, it has an impact on the margin, but I like the combination of volumes and margin that we had in the second quarter. As we head to the second-half of the year with the outline of our -- and the office we have in place that Hans mentioned, combined with new devices coming into the market. As we get closer to 5G launch, the underlying strength in the economy, I would expect that we will see good equipment volumes in the second-half of the year. And I would also expect to see good EBITDA dollars in the second-half of the year to go along with that.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, John. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys, thanks. Two if I can, consumer wireless broadband were strong. Did home broadband drive that? And how many home 4G, 5G customers do you have now? And second, a lot happening in NBN online these days with Boost going after AT&T, after they couldn't cable away last year. Did you look at that deal? How do you think about the potential for new competition from all these channels? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks. When it comes to broadband in general, that was brought up on our vision as we have outlined, we want to be a nationwide broadband provider, and we're going to use to access technology that is best suited for our customers in a mix of everything from fiber to 4G to 5G mmWave, C-Band, and all of that. And this quarter, we'll open up even more opportunities for that. We will open more 5G home markets, we will open more 4G home markets. And then of course, as Matt outlined as well, we took more Fios\u2019 subscribers than ever in the last three, four quarters. So this is playing out well for us. We're opening up all of that. We are very excited about what's going to happen in the second-half with a new CP that has C-Band as well. So, we executed everything we said we should do in the Investor Day, in the second quarter. And we look forward to the second-half of this year, and we will continue the report out what we're doing. The second question, I think that we're open for business, but we don't comment on any particular deals in a market or something like that. But we are happy with the customers we have on our MNO.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks so much. Just a quick one on TracFone, you said, closing in the second-half of the year. Any more color on the process, or the more timing expectations would be great. And then, on the C-Band, I think you said previously you wanted to deploy about 7,000 to 8,000 towers later this year. I see you reiterated the CapEx guide, but any color on getting the equipment supply chain and the ability to hit those targets in terms of rolling out? And any updates to your longer-term targets of 175 million on C-Band, how are you thinking beyond that? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: So, on the TracFone, I think nothing has changed since we outlined or we proposed acquisition. It\u2019s tracking according to plan with a process that we need to go through. The team is responding to all the questions we have. So it's going to be in the latter part on the second-half of the 2021, as we thought all the time. So, nothing strange, it's actually on track. But that's where we are. Second question was\u2026\nMatthew Ellis: C-Band.\nHans Vestberg: C-Band, yeah. The 7,000 to 8,000 sites, yeah, we can definitely say we're on track. When we reported the first quarter, we had just started everything. Now we feel we have a full funnel in the supply chain. The guys in our supply chain done a great job with our partners. We have all the gears we need to deploy the 7,000 to 8,000, and our team executing very well. So, we feel very good about being able to have 7,000 to 8,000 sites up by year-end. And when it comes for the long-term, I mean, we have the same ambitions as before, we haven't changed those, and we continue to execute. So, we will do it as fast as we can, given the different types of milestones that are involved in the spectrum. But, so far, we are executing on that plan, and we're on or ahead on the plan of executing right now for the end of the year.\nMatthew Ellis: Simon, one other data point for you, the vast majority of the radios that we need to turn on those 7,000 to 8,000 sites already seeing in our warehouses. So, the supply chain is robust, working very well with our partners. And, obviously a lot of work still to do, but the network teams from where we were in March, after we came out of the auction to where we are today. Their detailed plans in place and they are executing strongly against it.\nSimon Flannery: And the spectrum clearing is working okay?\nMatthew Ellis: Spectrum clearing is also on track. We stay close to the folks doing everything. We hear from them is that's completely on track as well.\nSimon Flannery: Sounds good. Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Simon. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys, thanks so much. In the first quarter, you guys talked about how the second-half of the year would be an improvement for Verizon in the consumer business. We've seen obviously some of the new promotions come out. Margins have drifted down to the 44% range. Does Ronan have permission from you, Hans, to take that down further, if you see some more gains opportunistically in the second-half with either the current kind of 5G handset upgrade promotions or new stuff coming down the pipe? And then the second question is consumer cost of service has been up pretty significantly for the last couple quarters relative to the past year. Is that related to CBM prepositioning? Or, is there something else going on? And what's the outlook for that? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: When it comes to the consumer group, and Matt explained a little bit why the margin is lower, because the hardware part of it is included there. And we think it\u2019s a good sign on what's happening in the market. I would say David, we constantly think about profitable growth and that has been our strategy as long as I have been here. And Ronan and team, they think about that. But of course, if they see an opportunity, as we saw when the traffic came back into stores, and they call them it\u2019s coming back, we did some offerings in this quarter, which was good timing. And we will continue to support Ronan, where we see he has a good solution for the market and our customers are going to love it. And I can tell you, our differentiation is really resonating with the market and that's what you see in the second quarter. And we will come back and see if there's something he wants to do in the second-half. But clearly, we're focused on profitable growth and we want to have -- we are writing high-quality business in high-quantity. That's what we want to do. And I think you see that coming through in these results.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah, so just adding to Hans, so obviously, the margin percent will be impacted by the volumes. We saw good volumes in the second quarter. But as Han said, what we're focused on is if you also look in their sequential service revenue growth continue to lead the industry in that, because not all net ads are created equal. And that also come in with EBITDA dollars increasing. So the margin percentage will play out where it does based off the volumes. But we're focused on you have seen that sequential revenue increase, and also the EBITDA dollars flowing in the right direction. In terms of your question around the cost of service, predominantly in consumer, but I think one of the items that we had in the second quarter was a step-up in the network rents and lease of about $60 million a quarter, as a result of the new lease payments we put in place. As you know, under the accounting, you look at the total payments over the life of the lease and kind of flat line irrespective of how the actual cash flow payments flows. So, there was obviously a significant upgrade to our lease agreements. And that was a one-time step-up in the quarterly rate there that flow through the books that\u2019s let\u2019s say about $60 million, close to a penny a share impact from that, that should be the same going forward now. So that's the biggest driver you're seeing on the cost of service.\nDavid Barden: So Matt, just maybe follow-up on that.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Dave. Okay. Go ahead, Dave.\nDavid Barden: Thanks. So just, that's all in consumer?\nMatthew Ellis: The vast majority of the wireless network costs are allocated to consumers, some of that is in business, but the majority is in consumer. Obviously, the majority of the customers, the majority of the wireless service revenue is in consumer. And so the costs are going to be allocated largely in line on a similar basis to that. So yes, most of it is in consumer.\nDavid Barden: And then probably worth noting that then your EPS guidance includes negative $0.03 for the two, three, four Q impact of that increased tower expense.\nMatthew Ellis: Absolutely, that's fully baked into the guidance and step-up in that cost. So, that comes back to the underlying strength of the business that we have even with that, that baked in as well.\nDavid Barden: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good morning. Curious what you learned during the pandemic and now the reopening, about where customers want to transact for wireless, whether it's upgrading phones, with changing service providers? And, are a large portion of wireless transactions simply destined to remain in physical locations, versus a virtual or online channel? And then just to follow-up, you mentioned a number of markets that you've been focused on for ultra wideband and 5G home. Just curious if you could share some population and household coverage numbers for ultra wideband and home for the end of \u201921, and target for the end of \u201922. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. No, of course, we see some changes in behavior when it comes to our customers. But, we had already started building our omni-channel that our customer can start on the web, and they can end in the store, or they can start in the store and on the phone, and all of that in order to see that they will do these as seamless as possible. But clearly, we see much more digital than before. But also, when the economy came back and the vaccinations in the United States were coming up on high levels, we also saw the traffic coming back into stores. So we\u2019ve had, I would say all our stores opened in the second quarter, and we see much more foot traffic than we have seen in the previous quarters. Not really back to pre-pandemic days, but clearly, fairly close. So, we think our customers still going to want to come into a store and see our technology and our products, but they might be wanting to finish the delivery and the purchase in a digital format. And that's how we build our store. So we're working very closely to see that the new behaviors that we can meet that\u2019s where our customers really feel good about dealing with us, and I think that our team are doing a great job in that area.\nMatthew Ellis: Mike, in terms of your question around the mmWave coverage, we don't really talk about the mmWave coverage. In terms of pops, you heard Hans mentioned upfront that we're on track to seeing 5% to 10% of dense urban usage on our mmWave by the end of the year. That's a combination of more customers having 5G devices in their hands, customer activity moving back to more pre-pandemic levels, and then, obviously, building out more mmWave sites. We said we would do 14,000 sites this year, over 30,000 by the end of the year. I can tell you, we are running well ahead of schedule for the 14,000 sites through the first-half of the year. And so as we do that, we continue to add coverage. And then we said we'd expect to cover 1 million to 2 million homes with mmWave open for sale by the end of the year. And we're on track with all of those items.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Any early look to 2022?\nMatthew Ellis: The build continues \u2013 obviously, we're not going to give guidance for 2022, but everything the network team is doing whether on mmWave, whether on C-Band. And remember, we said we'd be at around 100 million pops during the first quarter next year. We expect still on track to be at that level. So at this point in time, I can't speak more highly about the work the network team is doing as they build, whether it's the fiber that obviously is important to the network, the mmWave expansion, the C-Band expansion and continuing to have the best 4G network out there as well. So, they're doing a tremendous man activity, and they continue to be on both our 2021 plans and our longer-term plans, too.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open, sir.\nCraig Moffett: Yes. Hi, thank you. Two quick questions. First of all, I am going to return to a question that Phil asked, I didn't hear the discussion. Can you talk about the Dish wholesale deal with AT&T? What your observations are? And, whether you were part of that negotiation? And then separately, if you could just comment on whether you saw any significant impacts from the EBBP program during the quarter, either in your wireline business with Fios or your wireless business?\nHans Vestberg: Hey, when it comes to specific deals in the market, we don't comment on that. And apparently, this is something that AT&T won from T-Mobile, so I cannot comment on our involvement in itself or not. But as I said, we're open for business. We have a natural strategy model, which is paying off well for us with the five vectors of growth, and part of that is monetization of MNOs and we're very happy what we have.\nMatthew Ellis: Craig, to your second question, we saw some of our customer base certainly participate in that during the course of the second quarter. I wouldn't say it was a significant impact in our numbers, but we did certainly see our customers participating.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Greg. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Oh, great. Thank you. Two questions for me as well. I mean, first, AT&T moved to 30 and 36-month handset, EIPs periods this quarter, and your churn is even lower than theirs. Your customers stick around even longer on average. Have you thought about going longer than 24-months? And if not, why is 24-months sort of right period? And, I'm just really curious on C-Band, as we try to figure out how to model 2022 and you get the licenses cleared, and you put the switch and light that up for customers. As you go into 2022, how's your go-to-market strategy change, if at all? And what do consumers sort of see in terms of their experience that's going to be materially different? Obviously, it was a big investment, and I'm just sort of thinking through on a practical basis, what happens if that starts to kick in?\nHans Vestberg: Yeah, I can start with the C-Band. For obvious reason, we think it's an important moment. We are both amplifying and accelerating our 5G in the network, amplifying the opportunity. However, given away our commercial ideas when we're going to launch this right now we wouldn't do that. But, of course, we are excited over it. We think it's going to be great for our customer, it\u2019s going to be fantastic performance and it expands our 5G mobility options, our 5G fixed wireless access options, and it also extends our 5G Mobile Edge Compute options. So, it's just playing straight into our strategy. So we are excited over it. And we will come back how we will bring that to our customers, so they are equally delighted as they are with our network today, but it\u2019s getting something that is so much superior than anybody else.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. Hey, Doug, on your first question about the handsets device payment period, we're very comfortable with the offers we have in the marketplace. It's 24-months for a lot of items. Some of the higher priced items, it's a little bit longer just to manage that. But, as you mentioned, the churn is very, very strong. Dot six, five, and consumer for phone shows what we're doing with customers is working very, very effectively. If we feel the need to adjust it, we will do so, but it will be based off of what we see customers need and not be focused on any impact on the accounting treatment associated with it. So, we will continue to be focused on finding the right offers for our customers. And, I think you see from the results in the second quarter, what we're doing is resonating with customers, both from an ad standpoint and also a churn standpoint too.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Doug. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino of Bernstein. Your line is open, sir.\nPeter Supino: Hi, thank you. A couple of related questions. The first is one of your competitors has talked repeatedly about the network capacity improvements that come from 5G. If you adjust that company's target for M&A, you could infer that their capacity is up about seven times for their 5G expansion. And so, I'm wondering if you could suggest a similar number for Verizon\u2019s capacity and growth potential, considering the wonderful investment in the C-Band? And then, on a related note, as relates to the home business, I'm curious if you could describe how you think about allocating the cost of spectrum?\nHans Vestberg: Okay. On the first one, if you've been listening to what I've talked about around 5G before, first of all, 5G as a technology is better to handle data than 4G. And that's obvious, it really is better than 4G as well. So that's happening. Then you need to add to that -- you're not only talking about spectrum, you're talking about how you engineer and how you build the network. So in our case, of course, we see great opportunities for being able to handle much more data. And remember, today on the mmWave, we might use 400, sometimes 800 megahertz, but not more, and we have 1600 megahertz nationwide. So, there's so much more we can do. And as Kyle showed at the Investor Day, our headroom in the network is bigger than before. And that's before we start building what we're building right now. So we feel really confident how many ex we are doing. And remember, our 4G is already the best in the nation. And then we are adding up right now what we're doing in 5G that is also extraordinary good. So others can talk and we usually execute, and we will continue with that.\nMatthew Ellis: So Peter, on the second part of your question about allocating costs of the spectrum. I've reframed that and actually view it from the standpoint of this is the first time that we've had wireless technology, where we can drive multiple revenue streams off of the same network build, whether that be the mobility, which has obviously been the foundation of 4G, 3G, and everything since the start of wireless. But then the ability to also have fixed wireless access, to also have the public mobile edge compute, all coming off of that same network build, that same network investment, we think gives us the opportunity to provide a very good return on the investment that we've made in both C-Band and mmWave.\nPeter Supino: Thank you very much.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Peter. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. A couple if I could. Firstly, on the non-paid churn front, obviously that I think you guys noted the benefit because of some of the subsidy programs. But, at some point that will probably reverse for the industry as a whole. So could you help us understand how big of an impact that typically is in a normalized year, non-paid churn? And how much of a tailwind that is right now to get a sense for what that might do, when things normalize? And then secondly, I mean, you have a lot of content bundles now, you also have the new deal with Apple Arcade. Could you give us some sense for how this impacts your cost of service? And how much of the increase in cost of service is on accounted base? You did quantify the least number, but it would be good to get some sense for what this is doing overall to cost versus [indiscernible] kind of trends? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can, and Matt will talk about no-paid churn. When it comes to the content deal, I think I've said it a couple of times now. Our whole idea is to offering exclusive offers for our wireless customers. And we also want to offer that partnership to brands that we really think resonate with us. And the model, as we\u2019ve spoken about before is that this is incremental revenue for us. It's not only loyalty, it's actually incremental profit for us.  So it's a totally different model that might sometimes not been in the market before, because suddenly, we use the best network, the best distribution and the best brand to work with companies like Disney Plus, et cetera, to give our customers a premium experience, on top of the differentiation we're already have with a mix and match. And ultimately, when we make these customers to paying customers, we get our fair share of that, because we with our assets have created it together with the asset for Disney Plus, Discovery or gaming et cetera. So that's how the model is working. And as I said before, we're very pleased with it. I think we've six or seven of these offerings in the market right now and all of them are very positive to us and to our customers. And we will continue to see if we can find more. I think it\u2019s a unique model that we have created that nobody else has in the market. And as I said, again, it goes back to Ronan and the team being very, very innovative and creative to see that we bring the best to our customer, not only the best network, but also the differentiation in offering. So I have to say I'm very pleased with that. And as I said, we've more in the funnel.\nMatthew Ellis: Kannan, on your other question around the churn, I would say it's a very small number of basis points of benefit coming from the reduction in what we call involuntary churn. And what you're also seeing in the total churn number is actually the benefits of the engagement with the customer, the experience the customer has on the network, the other experiences we bring to that relationship that Hans just touched on, being a bigger piece of the strength in the overall phone churn number that we reported, especially on the consumer side. And in terms of the impact of cost of sales, obviously, the content cost associated with the items that Hans mentioned, do flow through there. And you should expect to see that number continue to be a contributor of that line. But when we look at the overall profitability of bringing that together, the overall customer proposition, it's EBITDA additive to the business, and also brings a better experience to the customers. We see that as a win-win.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you, both.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Kannan. Brad, we've got time for one more question. Let's go to one last question, please.\nOperator: Certainly, your last question is from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First off on business EBITDA margins, at your Analyst Day back in March, you'd guided to sustaining north of 25%. And we saw that below that in the second quarter, also in the first quarter, although there's that one-time impact. And it sounds like you're guiding for that to continue to be below 25%. I'm just curious what's changed so quickly, that you're targeting below that target, at least it looks like for 2021? And then also, as it relates to the biggest upgrade ever promotion, when we look across the space competitively, obviously AT&T has been doing something similar since the fourth quarter, even T-Mobile did something just yesterday. Do you really look at this as a promotion implying at some point there is an expiration and you pull back from the market? Or, is this really just the new way of competing in today's competitive market and really something that investors should assume in some form or the other is going to be with us for a long period, if not permanently? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I can make a quick answer on the promotion, and Matt will come back. We have already pulled the biggest 5G upgrades on the market. That we did today.\nMatthew Ellis: Today. Today is the wireless day.\nHans Vestberg: Today. So yes, we see it is coming in and out when it's the right moment. But, Matt will probably comment a little bit more on it. On the business side, in Q4, 2018, Matt and I talked about that we think that this is one of the great opportunities we'll have over time with the business side. Remember, we had never consolidated our business side, it was compartmentalize in between all the different businesses we have. Tom and the team have during that moment, and remember, we said we're going to invest in order to see that we have the platforms of products, or CX and UX for our customers to be harmonized in order to be able to scale this to be a good business, and that they are doing and they probably are halfway through it. They're doing a lot of transformation in the business. At the same time, there are some headwinds, as we've seen before. That would be the wireline sort of cyclical -- or no, it's not cyclical, it's a sustained decline. And then, we have a wireless business, where we take more than our fair share. We are leading in all segments. And that balance, of course, is coming into this quarter. Of course, we had more hardware this quarter as well. And then, we're building for the new opportunities with 5G Mobile Edge Compute, private 5G networks, the 5G business internet, which is using fixed wireless access, so we have a lot of new products coming out as we're building. And we have the same ambitions, when it comes to financials, then we will be realistic, what's happening in the market and how the team -- but I'm proud of the team or what they are transforming to, and what we're aspiring for. And seeing the progress on Mobile Edge Compute, and business internet, that's of course, new opportunities that we have not seen coming into the P&L yet, but we're building it together with the transformation we're doing.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah, so just a couple other comments on the business margin there, Colby. So, Hans mentioned the higher volume as we mentioned it upfront that the wireless volumes that we saw the gross ads were not just higher than 2Q last year, also higher than 2Q, \u201819. So certainly seeing volumes come back, especially in enterprise and small, medium business, so that's having some impact there. And then obviously, the wireline pressure, I would expect second-half margins to be reasonably similar to what we saw in the first-half of the year. The business transformation work the team is doing, is having positive impacts with more to come as we go forward here. So, we feel good about the direction the teams headed there, in spite of these secular wireline pressures that we see. And then in terms of your question on promotions, as Hans said, it's a promotion. That means it has both a start date and an end date, and today is the end date. So we've run promotions since the beginning of the wireless industry. They've evolved over time, they will continue to do so. And the great position we're in is because of the strong operational results and financial results. It gives us the ability when the time's right in the marketplace to bring the right promotion out there. We felt this was the right promotion at this time with the economic reopening and wanting to get more customers with a 5G device in their hand, as we're about to launch C-Band within the next six months. So, we will continue to look at what is the right promotion for the right time. But, the underlying operational performance of the business showing up in sequential wireless service revenue increase yet again, gives us the position to have flexibility as we think about how we approach the market.\nColby Synesael: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Colby. That's all the time we have today for questions. Thanks, everybody, and be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-21 15:07:05", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates discussed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.27 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from a special item of approximately $223 million related to the sale of certain wireless licenses. Excluding the effects of this special item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the first quarter.  On April 8, we announced a recall process for approximately 2.5 million Jetpack units, which impacted some customers enrolled in our distance learning programs. The overall impact included within consolidated operating income was approximately $160 million during the quarter, split between $100 million in the business segment and the remaining $60 million in consumer. The impact included within reported and adjusted earnings per share was $0.03 in the first quarter.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter. \nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Brady, and welcome to all to this first quarter earnings call. We marked more than one year since the devastating effects of COVID-19. While we see significant progress in vaccination, customer sentiment and recover our economy, there is still a lot to go before we're back to normal.  I'm proud how Verizon has responded during this period for all our stakeholders as we have executed on our balanced stakeholder-driven strategy. And as I said, during the worst period of the pandemic, Verizon will come out stronger as a company when this is over.  During the last 12 months, we have progressed all our positions with customers, employees, and added great assets to an already strong position. And today, we stand stronger than ever to compete in a market and serve our customers.  Looking back on the quarter, we amplified and accelerated our strategy through our average 160 megahertz nationwide position in C-Band. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, the combination of C-Band and our millimeter wave places us in a unique position of strength to execute on all 5G opportunities, 5G Home, 5G mobility and 5G mobile edge compute. On top of that, we have all our five vectors of growth in place, together with our network leadership and a strong network as a service foundation.  And the progress we made in the quarter confirms that our strategy is working. We had growth in all our businesses for the first time since the launch of Verizon 2.0. We had growth in both EPS and cashflow.  With all this work by our great team, we have a head start in the post-COVID era, with a clear and differentiated strategy, diverse go-to-market models, network leadership, industry-leading partner ecosystem and a strong brand, all of which together provides a great platform and foundation to achieve our growth targets for 2021 and beyond. Let me talk about some of the highlights from the first quarter. Our network team continues to do great things by leading the network performance in the market, as well as deploying more assets than ever before \u2013 millimeter wave, C-Band, 4G, 5G and fiber. I have a lot of confidence that this team will accelerate our network leadership.  Our unique Mix & Match model continues to deliver with the migration to unlimited and unlimited premium in the quarter, as well as building on our exclusive offerings like Disney+ and the most recent Discovery+ that was launched earlier in the quarter. And we're pleased with the Discovery+ with the current enrollment rates we've seen so far.  Our brand and responsible business framework, Citizen Verizon, continue to set standards in the industry. Verizon was recognized by Fast Company as the sixth most innovative company in the Corporate Social Responsibility earlier this quarter. Brand Finance recognized us as the most valuable telecom brand. Within ESG, we have ambitious goals, such as our commitment to be net zero in the carbon emission by 2035. Our longstanding focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is evidenced by the fact that we have 100% pay equity by gender globally and by race ethnicity in the United States. And earlier this week, we also launched our 2020 ESG report. We continue with a high level of deployment on millimeter wave and fiber in the quarter and we're on the track to deliver on our operational targets for the year.  We brought 5G service to several additional cities. We currently have 30 5G home and 67 5G mobility cities live and more to come. We recently signed our first European private 5G deal with Associated British Ports. We also expanded our 5G edge partnership with AWS, with private 5G and edge computing to our customers.  We continue to scale our network as a service strategy across new markets and verticals through a diverse set of partnerships. We have partnered with leading brands across diverse verticals, such as Honda to innovate connected and autonomous driving; Deloitte and SAP to create a 5G and edge computing retail digital platform that will provide retailers with real-time operations data; and Dreamscape and Arizona State University to build and commercialize immersive learning and training.  At our Investor Day, we shared with you our plans and commitment for C-Band and Ultra Wideband deployment, which continues to progress well. Our intent is to invest $10 billion of incremental C-Band CapEx to accelerate the integration on this capacity into our network.  We recently signed deals with Crown Castle and SBA to accelerate our C-Band deployment and look forward to providing further updates on the build status throughout the year.  We have already ordered half of the total network equipment needed from our 5G suppliers to support C-Band deployments in 2021. And the satellite operators are on track to clear the spectrum between third and fourth quarter of 2021 for the first tranche of spectrum.  In addition, we continue to expand our Ultra Wideband coverage in Q1. We deployed 3,600 new Ultra Wideband sites. And to date, we have close to 21,000 sites on air and on track to reach 30,000 by the end of this year.  One Fiber formed the strategic backbone of our intelligent edge network, and we continue to expand fiber deployment. And to date, we have deployed more than 42,000 route miles.  We were also pleased with the low rates we achieved for long-term financing of this critical strategic investment. We view the record investor demand as supportive of our strategy and our financial discipline.  Lastly, we were also very proud to offer prominent roles to nine diversity and inclusion financial firms as part of the $25 billion financing.  As I outlined earlier, our investments in our network and customers are generating solid revenue growth across all three of our operating groups. Our success in Mix & Match continue to drive uptake of unlimited plans and higher ARPA, supporting year-over-year growth of 2.4% in wireless service revenue, up from 2.2% in the fourth quarter last year. Ronan and the team closed out Q1 with strong momentum. And I'm excited to see their Q2 performance now that almost all our stores have reopened. In addition, we see solid growth in Fios and with Fios Internet reporting the best first quarter net adds in six years.  Additionally, Verizon Media Group continued to contribute meaningful growth, including the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year on the top line.  With that, let me ask Matt to provide some deeper insight to the financial of the first quarter.\nMatthew Ellis : Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. As Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks, the first quarter has been a truly exciting and transformative period for our company.  I am pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start for the year based on our strong operational and financial performance. We are seeing continued strength in our core business with traction across all five of our growth vectors, driving higher revenues and increased demand for our products and services.  With the positive momentum exiting the first quarter and the ongoing recovery of business activity, we are highly confident that our actions in the marketplace will deliver strong results throughout the year.  In the first quarter, consolidated operating revenue was $32.9 billion, up year-over-year by 4.0%. High quality sustainable wireless service revenue growth, a recovery in wireless equipment revenues, strong Fios momentum, and excellent digital advertising trends resulted in revenue growth across consumer, business and media.  Total wireless service revenues were up 2.4% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 2.2% year-over-year growth that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Additional details on total wireless performance are provided in the financial and operating information and the supplemental earnings release schedules on our website.  Total Fios revenues were up 2.5% year-over-year, driven by the strong broadband volumes in recent quarters. Our portfolio of mobility and broadband products and services continues to lead the industry, delivering value to our customers. And we are well positioned to maintain and expand our leadership position as we enter new markets and broaden our offerings and network capabilities.  I'm extremely proud of the team's execution of our Business Excellence Program over the past three years. At the end of the first quarter, we achieved our cumulative cash savings goal of $10 billion, well ahead of our year-end 2021 target. We will realize additional benefits moving forward from the ways we've improved our operating systems and procedures. As we've said previously, we will create additional savings opportunities on a continuous basis beyond this program.  The strong revenue performance across our three business segments for the quarter, combined with our best-in-class cost structure and disciplined focus on the business, delivered adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion, which represents growth of 2.0% over the prior year. The Jetpack recall had a 50 basis points impact to adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter.  Brady highlighted the adjusted EPS for the first quarter at $1.31. The growth of 4.0% reflects the strength in our core business and sets the stage for Verizon to fully capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace, while giving us excellent momentum relative to our full-year year adjusted EPS guidance.  Now, let's review our operating segment results, starting with Consumer on Slide 7. This quarter, we continued to see excitement around our unlimited offerings, 5G capabilities, Mix & Match value proposition and our best-in-class Fios broadband services. All of this is part of our customer differentiation strategy, which drives deeper and broader relationships with our customers.  Starting with wireless, we had total postpaid activations of 6.4 million for the quarter, up approximately 14% compared to the same period last year, made up of approximately 2.3 million gross adds and 4.1 million upgrades.  First quarter seasonality drove phone net losses of 225,000, which included the last major cohort of disconnects of approximately 90,000 phones related to our Keep America Connected program. Early in the quarter, wireless in-store sales were again tempered by our COVID safety protocols as we saw elevated levels of store closures and limited foot traffic. Beginning in March, the improved COVID environment allowed for almost all of our stores to be open. Not surprisingly, we saw our best volume of the quarter in March, producing positive phone net adds in a month. The strong March momentum combined with our new innovative promotional offers positions us well for the second quarter.  We continue to be pleased with the quality of the additions we are attracting. Similar to last quarter, over 90% of new accounts came in on an unlimited plan and over 50% of these accounts opted for premium unlimited service. At quarter-end, over 65% of our base was on an unlimited plan, with more than 23% of our base taking a premium plan. We have plenty of room to continue to expand these penetration rates and believe that they will grow alongside our 5G adoption rates, which currently resides at 14% of our consumer postpaid phone base.  5G adoption and the customer differentiation associated with our premium and unlimited plans will further benefit our retention efforts, which remains strong in Q1 with phone churn of 0.77% for the quarter. We continue to take a balanced and cost effective approach to customer retention with strong NPS scores, best-in-class network performance and strong value proposition, leading to our excellent levels of customer retention.  Turn into Fios, we posted our third consecutive quarter of strong growth and high take rates for our best-in-class broadband products, with consumer Fios internet net adds of 98,000, well ahead of the first quarter 2020 performance of 59,000.  Total Fios Internet net adds of 102,000 was the best first quarter performance in six years. This reflects both the quality of the product as well as the positive sentiment around our Mix & Match phone pricing structure, which provides our customers with unmatched simplicity and optionality.  Now let's move to Slide 8 to discuss the consumer financial performance. The higher phone activations in the quarter were the major driver of the 4.7% increase in operating revenues to $22.8 billion.  The continued adoption of our unlimited and premium unlimited plans drove over 1.5% increase in consumer wireless service revenue for the quarter of $13.7 billion. This growth comes even as Travel Pass and our international roaming revenues remain at subdued levels. Strong Internet volumes drove the 2.2% increase in consumer Fios revenue to $2.9 billion.  While we continue to experience revenue pressure associated with secular video trends, our broadband subscriber growth combined with a shift up in speed tiers more than offset that pressure and will continue to drive solid revenue performance for us.  Consumer segment EBITDA grew 2.8% to $10.4 billion. The EBITDA margin was 45.5% in the quarter, down 90 basis points from the prior year due to higher volumes, which drove increased equipment revenues and associated costs, as well as the Jetpack recall, which had approximately 30 basis points of impact on EBITDA margin for the quarter.  Now, let's move to our Business segment on Slide 9. Our Business team continues to lead the industry towards next generation B2B applications. Hans referenced some of their accomplishments from the prior 90 days, including announcements on MEC and private 5G.  In addition, we launched Verizon Frontline, our branding for our advanced network and technology we deliver for first responders. Being the wireless market share leader for public safety and in all of our other customer groups puts us in an ideal position with our customers to be their digital transformation partner of choice.  Business wireless trends continued their strong momentum in the first quarter of 2021. Postpaid activations were 2 million, with total net adds of 156,000, including 47,000 phones. Remember that Q1 of last year benefited from the COVID related bulk purchases, providing much of the variance for the year-over-year change in gross to net adds.  Public sector demand remains strong, even as distance learning programs settle into a more normal pattern of buying activity. Small and medium business trends improved sequentially, as the team continues to make progress in supporting local businesses as they position for an improving environment. As more stores reopened in early March, not only did consumer volumes see a lift, SMB volumes benefited as well, an encouraging sign for the rebound.  Our enterprise team continues to assist our customers in their digital transformation and unlock the potential of 5G. Segment postpaid phone churn was 1.01% in the quarter, an improvement of 1 basis point over the prior year. Our strong churn performance reflects the strength and reliability of our network, combined with the full suite of services and solutions that we provide.  Let's now move to Slide 10 to review the business financial performance. The high demand for our services and our brand reputation for reliable connectivity has translated into healthy revenue growth with Verizon Business group.  Operating revenues for the Business segment was $7.8 billion, up 1.3% year-over-year, the highest rates of growth since the creation of the Business segment in the Verizon 2.0 structure. This growth highlights the success of our business transformation process as strong wireless service growth of 6.2% offset secular pressure in wireline.  Business segment EBITDA margin was 24.6% in the quarter, down approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. The Jetpack recall mentioned earlier had a more pronounced impact on the Business segment, reducing EBITDA margins by about 130 basis points.  Now, let's move on to Slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. Verizon Media Group continues to deliver strong performance driven by high customer engagement with our brands and demand for our advertising platforms.  Total revenue for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up approximately 10.4% from a year ago, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Growth in the quarter was fueled by strong advertising trends, growing 26%, including 45% growth in DSP revenues. Revenue from our owned and operated brands grew 13% compared to the same period last year.  We saw continued high consumer engagement with strength in sports and finance, as daily active users grew 22% and 8% respectively from the prior year.  Let's now move to our cash flow results on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.7 billion, up approximately $0.9 billion from the prior year, driven by our continued operational discipline and net benefits from our liability management activities, which lowered borrowing rates from last year.  Capital spending for the first quarter totaled $4.5 billion as we continue to support traffic growth on our 4G LTE network, while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network. This includes approximately $40 million for C-Band related items.  As a result, free cash flow for the quarter was $5.2 billion, up 46% year-over-year. We made payments of $45 billion in the first quarter to the FCC for C-Band spectrum won at the recently completed Auction 107.  To finance this purchase, we raised over $31 billion in March, in addition to the $12 billion raised in Q4. The weighted average maturity of these C-Band borrowings was 17 years, and we achieved a very attractive average cost of funding of 2.5%, benefiting from record order books for our US dollar offerings.  We are delighted that the credit rating agencies considered the spectrum asset purchases as strategic and critical to our business operations and held their rating levels unchanged. The success in the capital markets is a result of our disciplined capital allocation policy, coupled with our consistent track record of delivering on our commitments made to our investors.  We exited the quarter with net unsecured debt of $137.4 billion and our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2.9 times. Based on our current cash flow assumptions, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 2.8 times by the end of the year. We will evaluate the level of our cash balance based on the recovery in the economy and developments with the pandemic.  Now, let's review our annual guidance targets on Slide 13. As Hans mentioned in his opening remarks, we're on track to achieve our guidance for the year, which remains unchanged. Reaffirming our comments from the Investor Day last month, we expect no material impact to our adjusted earnings per share guidance from our C-Band program for this year. We do expect C-Band related capital spending to be between $2 billion to $3 billion for 2021, and we will provide updates on the quarterly earnings calls.  With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2021.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Matt. Let me sum this up in a couple of easy buckets. First of all, our strategy is unchanged. Our focus is clear. We're going to accelerate our multi-purpose network strategy, including the C-Band that were required. We're going to focus on amplify and accelerate the five vectors of growth. And we're going to see with that that we're going to deliver on our 2021 commitments both operationally and financially.  And as I said earlier, I feel really good about our position and the team that I have that they will deliver on that.  With that, I hand it over to Brady. \nBrady Connor : Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, you may go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hans, could we get your thoughts on the competitive landscape now and maybe whether the new pricing from Comcast or any other competitive development sort of affects your view of the return to growth in terms of postpaid phone net adds here in the second quarter. From your - the last slide there, it looks like that you expect some nice acceleration.  And then secondly, there's potentially just a massive amount of federal stimulus money flowing into broadband infrastructure deployment over the next year or two. I realize we're very early in the process and the rules aren't laid out yet. But do you think Verizon is in a position to capture some of those funds as you sort of continue your heavy spending on Ultra Wideband deployment? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, John. On the competitive situation, I mean, as you have seen yourself, it is a competitive market and it's been for quite a while. But with our model, I can see that we are actually winning in any case because with our growth trajectory that we have in all our businesses and a unique model, especially on the consumer side with the Mix & Match, the value proposition, and you saw in the quarter, we continue to do that. And \u2013 but also, as Matt mentioned, it was a little bit light in the beginning of the quarter because of stores that were closed, et cetera. And then we saw a very good sort of strength in our port ratios and our growth in the end of the quarter because we have all the stores open. So, we look forward to the second quarter and the second part of the year. And as Ronan said when we had the Investor Day, we believe we're going to have a good second part of the year. Second quarter is really close to us. And what we've seen so far, we feel good about it. So, again, we have an overall strategy in order to address the market for consumer that is really working with this step up, the migrations and all of that. So, in general, we feel good about it. The team is doing well. You saw we came out with a new promo as well. And we've always had lots of financial discipline. We do this because we know we can actually capture market at the good high-quality customers.  On the infrastructure, as I said, this is in the planning stages. So, it's hard to say if this is true or not. So - but on the other hand, I think that what we are telling the administration is, of course, that accessibility, affordability and usability are the three buckets to address the digital divide.  And when it comes to accessibility, we have to recognize \u2013 and I worked in 180 countries with networks, that the networks during the COVID-19 in the U.S., they were really working well. There were basically no major issues at all. They could deliver even though traffic moved around. So, I think that what we are advocating for, we want that private sector continue to invest in the network and leading that charge and then having government work more with the affordability of it. So, we have plans that meets all needs for all different customer segments in the market. So, that's what we're advocating for. That's the same as BRT is advocating for as well. We don't think that any price regulation would be \u2013 that will be counterproductive to the market. So, in general, again, it's very early on. I mean, it's a plan that has not been approved and submitted, but at least we're advocating together with BRT and with ourselves what we think should be the right.  Matt, any more comments on the competitive landscape?\nMatthew Ellis: No, I think you touched on the key points, Hans. The only other thing I'd add is you mentioned the strong momentum coming out of margin to the quarter. You add that with the promotion that we put in place at the start of the month that we think is an innovative promotion that's addressing a customer pain point that nobody else has addressed in the past. We're seeing good traction on that in the early days of that. So, certainly feel good about the momentum heading into the quarter on the volume side. When you add that in with the financial performance we saw in the first quarter, it was set up nicely for 2Q and the rest of the year.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, John. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. You had another strong quarter with Fios Internet. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit of insight into the sustainability of that. Obviously, 2020 was a great year in terms of broadband demand. But you seem to be sustaining that into this year. Is this share? Is this incremental marketing opportunities? And what's happening with the speed up-tiering there? And maybe related to that on 5G home, you've had a number of announcements here recently. I know we're headed to 15 million households. But what's the latest on the ground today? And what should we expect through the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Simon. Yes, we had good Fios quarter again. I mean, overall, I think the broadband is in demand and our high-quality Fios, of course, a great opportunity for us to expand on them. We \u2013 I think personally, that this will continue. The demand for broadband will continue. We are just starting a total revolution of using technology, which is scalable and sustainable in the post era of the COVID. So - and we are great position. And that also is going to help me tremendously when we come with 5G Home or millimeter wave and C-Band and all that because we know how to deal with home broadband. And that is an advantage we have to any others that is trying to do fixed wireless access and we've been on to it for a long time.  And as we saw as well, now we're up to over 30 markets with 5G Home, I mean, adding some 20 very recently. So, we're on fire on this right now. We have a very big belief in our 5G Home. And then, later the year, when C-Band comes, we're going to add even more coverage on that. And all is embedded in our work with the ecosystem from the from the beginning and how we have developed our own IPRs on how to do self-install, how to do all the sort of grids when it comes to millimeter wave and having a great opportunity to see that our customer gets a fantastic service.  So, all in all, this is a full package that we are bringing to the market in order to have a full scale broadband for the country. I think it's absolutely the right moment. But don't forget, on the business side as well, we now - it's called 5G Internet on the business side. We are using the same methodology. We are doing the scaling on the same platforms and we address another market with it. It goes back to a strategy that we had for all the time. We have a network service and we scale it with different customers. And that scale will help us with growth. But it also means that with the platform thinking we have, that will fall to the bottom line. And if you see in this quarter, all three units are growing and we're bringing it to all to bottom line and we still have more to do. And - but we know how to do it and we'll have the model. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Yes, great. Thanks, Simon. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So earlier this week, you announced that you had officially commenced the deployment of your C-Band licenses and that you would expect 100 million POPs to be covered by at least 60 megahertz as we get into March of next year. Equally important to creating that coverage is making sure your customer base is able to use that capacity, which is going to require a fairly significant handset upgrade cycle. You noted that you had just put a new promo into the market this quarter. How are you thinking about stimulating device upgrades over the course of the year? What's embedded in your guidance in terms of maybe doing more of this? And then, just as a follow-up question, you had noted you do expect that the phase one spectrum will be cleared by 3Q, 4Q, but it seems like you don't expect to be fully utilizing it until March. So, there's a bit of a gap. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can do to close out or that's just what the supply chain can deliver right now? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: First of all, I can only say that we are on to a false start on the C-Band. It's only some six weeks ago since we can start to talk to our employees, we could talk to the partners, we can talk to the satellite companies, our suppliers [indiscernible]. We have already ordered half of the equipment. We have made agreement with the tower cos. We have talked to the satellite companies that has reaffirmed that they believe that they can clear this first tranche of the spectrum in third quarter and fourth quarter. And we actually made a press release yesterday that we're now starting deploying C-Band as well, and that's six weeks. So, the technology was on fire to make this happen.  And as said when we had our investor day, we said that we worked with the date we got from the FCC because we hadn't talked to anybody. Right now, this is the best dates we have. And of course, we are pushing as much as possible to see that we get this up for our customers as soon as possible in order to get a great experience.  And then flowing that over to the to the phone question. I think that we have seen a great uptake on 5G phones and unlimited premium. And as Matt said, in the quarter, over 20% of the unlimited new customers took unlimited premium. That tells you there's a lot of value in it and a lot of 5G in it. And with the new promo that Matt talked about, we believe that is going to also drive 5G. So, we believe that what we have in the market right now will continue to grow the 5G base. And as said, this is going faster than what we saw in 4G. So, we will continue to monitor, of course. But we see a good uptake on it.  And we can also add that, when it comes to the iPad that have been just recently launched, it's also another addition of mmWave and how that comes into the whole ecosystem. So, again, we feel good about the uptake and we feel good about the line of products we have. And we have the promo supporting it. So, that's going to also make it go well together with the C-Band deployment coming later this year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan.\nPhil Cusick: I wonder if you can dig into the enterprise and small business results. S&P was up year to year which is great to see. And I'm curious what you see in bookings versus growing revenue this quarter?\nHans Vestberg:\nTami:\nTami:\nPhil Cusick: Is there any impact here from the One Fiber initiative? Is that helping at all on the enterprise or SMB side? Or is it still too early for them?\nHans Vestberg: I think on the enterprise side, of course, we have some opportunities with the fiber. But remember, our priorities was clear. It's getting fiber to our 4G and our 5G network. That's really where we can get the most bang for the buck. And then we do [indiscernible] enterprise when we have them.  On the small and medium, that's going to take some time. That's what I said before. But now, when we have the 5G Internet, we will actually have fixed wireless access, we have a really good product for small and medium businesses. So, some possibility on enterprise, but they are also still to come. As was said, it's more focused on building the network with fiber, right, so we can see that our customer gets the experience that they need to have when it comes to our exceptionally great 5G with mmWave and C-Band.\nMatthew Ellis: Still just to follow-on on that, it is part of, as Hans mentioned previously, about building the network once and then monetizing it different ways. Just as we talk about with wireless and 5G, monetizing it in different ways, with the fiber, we have the same opportunity too. So, once you \u2013 as you're lighting up those cell sites, when you go past an enterprise building, the opportunity to go in there and have more customers or enterprise customers on net rather than paying a third-party access absolutely is an opportunity for us to create incremental return on that investment in fiber. So, again, another example of multi-use network.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. \nDavid Barden: I guess the first one on the Fios revenue. We saw pretty strong pickup. I know that kind of on a year-over-year basis, there's been a mix shift and an uptake on the higher speed of broadband services, but sequentially it was a big number. I'm wondering if you guys did something on price on the broadband or even on the video that would have contributed to that move.  And then the second question, I guess, Matt, you guys threw out a lot of numbers out on Media, 26% advertising growth, 13% owned property growth, 10.4% total revenue growth. Could you kind of break that down what the moving parts are kind of dragging down some of those bigger, higher eye-popping numbers? And is this kind of a one year level set over a depressed 2020 and we're going to return to some kind of more \"normal\" revenue growth pattern in 2022? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: If I start with the Fios revenue, what you're really seeing here is the impact of what the team started in the first quarter last year. We introduced Mix & Match into our Fios offering. It's been great for our consumer business. We introduced it into Fios in first quarter last year. Obviously, the initial benefit we were seeing there got interrupted as the pandemic got underway. But we now have three quarters of very strong volumes, starting in third quarter last year, fourth quarter and now again in the first quarter here, our best first quarter in total Fios' six years.  And so, what that means is you've got an Internet base of customers in Fios that's now more than 5% higher than it was a year ago. And so, that's driving the revenue growth even as you have the secular pressures coming on the video side. It's really volume created as much as step-ups or anything else, although there are obviously step-ups in there and opportunities to move customers to gigabit service and so on. But the strong volumes based off the quality of service, combined with bringing the Mix & Match there, has worked very well for us in consumer mobility, now working well for us in Fios. And as you saw, we brought the Mix & Match construct into our SMB wireless offerings as well. So, very excited about what that's going to do.  On the Media revenue side, as you say, the 10.4%, up double digits for the second consecutive quarter, you remember both fourth quarter and now first quarter aren't really lapping COVID impacted quarters. So, what you're seeing here is the benefit of the hard work the team's been doing over the past couple of years. And that's really showing up on the advertising trends, as we talked about there. Offsetting that, to your question, how do you get from those higher numbers down to the 10%, things like search revenue continue to be a headwind and will likely continue to be so. But we're very encouraged by the advertising and the O&O momentum that we have. And as you say now, that's not a one year thing as we go forward. The team's gaining some good momentum. Hans?\nHans Vestberg: I just want to reiterate on the Verizon Media Group again. If we go back to where we started the strategy in 2018, we reset the business plan and we start to cut costs, then we reshaped all the products all the way from the owned and operated. And all the OO brands, we combined the ad platform. The work has been immense by the Verizon Media Group team. And now we see sort of the fruits of that hard work with growth in two consecutive quarters with double digits. So, I just want to shout out to the team that this was the plan we set and they are actually delivering on the plan. So, I think we have a great future with these guys. They have clearly a good product portfolio. And digital is going to be important in the future. So by that, I think we're in a good position. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. \nMichael Rollins: I was curious if we could go back to one of the comments you made earlier about Verizon reaching the cumulative cost cutting target of $10 billion. And if you could unpack that in terms of how much have that helped the EBITDA versus the CapEx side of the investment process for Verizon? And then, maybe secondly, how should investors think about the pace going forward of what incremental cost cutting can \u2013 like for Verizon over the next three to five years? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: Look, I'm incredibly proud of the team's efforts over the past three plus years now as we've really lent in on identifying ways to continue to make us more efficient and maintain our position having the best cost structure in the industry, which we think is going to continue to be important going forward, obviously. In terms of your first question, there is a split between both CapEx and P&L items behind the $10 billion. It's roughly even between those two, where you see that come from. So on the CapEx side, that means we've been able to do more deployments for the same amount of money than we would have done previously. That's allowed us to do some of the things across the network as we continue to transform the network not just in deploying 5G, but also the Intelligent Edge Network transformation going on, the One Fiber that's the backbone in there as well. That's going to give us benefits for years to come as a result of some of the efficiencies. And then, on the P&L side, some of those have helped contribute to the bottom line, but some of them have also allowed us to reinvest in the business, so that we can continue to be competitive in the marketplace, continue to bring new promotions and so on to our consumers and you see the value of us doing that. And in terms of the pace going forward, just because we've hit the target doesn't mean we slow down. We will have continuous improvement going forward here. The team has got good momentum. And the great news is, we didn't coast to the finish line here, we ran through the finish line, we accelerated through the tape. There is a lot more opportunities for us. Obviously, the last year has identified even more items for us. So, as we go forward, we will continue to increase the efficiency of the business both on the income statement and also from a capital side as well. So, a lot more to come.\nHans Vestberg: No. And I just want to agree with Matt. I think the structural changes on the platform thinking and using \u2013 making the network with the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, some of those benefits we haven't even seen yet even with those investments are done. But also, the new structure we have in the group, we have the three strong CEOs running their businesses, has also unveiled much more efficiencies than we have seen before and how they run it. So, I agree with Matt. This is part of our governance constantly to see that we find more efficiencies because that means that we can be even stronger in the market and having the best cost structure for us is important.\nMichael Rollins: And is this a target you would expect to continue to give further updates on and compare it relative to what the initial $10 billion goal was? Or now that you've achieved the goal, does the progress just get wrapped into the totality of financial performance and outlooks for Verizon?\nMatthew Ellis: As we go forward here, obviously, over the past three, four years, as we looked at the opportunities ahead of us, this was a major opportunity. So that's how we gave a very specific target. As I mentioned, we will continue to work with this. It will be obviously inherent in our targets. But as I think about the biggest opportunities ahead of us over the next three to four years, they are around growth. Everything we're doing with 5G and all the other parts of our business. So, that's why the targets that we gave at the Investor Day were all about growth, whether that be how quickly we're going to deploy the C-Band that we got, continuing to build out mmWave, the total addressable market for 5G Home, for MEC, and then the revenue growth that we talked about over the next five years. We will obviously continue to drive cost savings and efficiencies throughout the business. But the biggest opportunities for us going forward here when we look at everything in front of us is driving top line growth and we're very excited about pursuing those.\nOperator: The next question is from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Comcast significantly changed its pricing in the MVNO to now offer sort of family plan discounts. Can you just talk about the renegotiation that you and the cable industry just had on the MVNO and what your view is of the kind of the status of that relationship and how you see it evolving going forward? Obviously, the new pricing is considerably more aggressive and now sits on top of your pricing all the way down in family plans up to about four or five lines.\nHans Vestberg: I cannot go into details of any commercial agreements we have. But what I can say is that, we feel good about our network-as-a-service strategy where we have our value \u2013 our own sort of premium brand with Verizon. We have the MVNOs addressing a certain part and then we have the Visible and all of that. That's the whole idea. And for us this is accretive. We have a good relationship with our MVNO partners. We see them as enterprise customers, but we also see that this is accretive to us because we have all these. Nobody in the market has the same opportunity as we have to play all the way from our premium Verizon, which you heard Matt and me talk about, how we migrate and we're doing it in a great job, Ronan and team. And then we also have the MVNO partners bringing in customers and revenue and the best return on investment. And ultimately, we start building new markets with Visible and later on this year with TracFone and then we have an unparalleled position to anyone else in the market to be growing.  So, I feel good about it. I feel good about the relationship with the MVNOs. We treat them as an important enterprise customers and we will continue to do so.\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. I would agree with everything that Hans said. Look, the idea of bundled pricing for customers, when we introduced Share Everything Plans back in 2012, so it's something we've been doing for a long time. It makes a lot of sense. As Hans said, we're glad to have the traffic on our network and it just gives us another opportunity to monetize the network in multiple different ways.\nCraig Moffett: And if I could just ask one follow-up. Do you have any update on the timing of the TracFone transaction and the progress through regulatory in Washington?\nHans Vestberg: I think everything we said from the beginning is holding true. The process is continuing as expected. And as I said, this is a second half of 2021 event when this is going to be approved. So, it's progressing as expected. We don't believe it's going to be earlier. We think it's going to be somewhere in the third quarter, which we said also when we announced it. So, we will give an update when we know more about it. Just a couple of different events still there. But again, it's progressing as we expected from the beginning.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.\nTimothy Horan: Two questions. One, AT&T obviously has phone subsidies for all. Do you think this becomes a permanent fixture in the industry again? And then, secondly, business, I think, communications networking probably transformed more in the last year than the last decade with a lot more collaboration and conferencing. And, obviously, you acquired BlueJeans a year ago. Can you talk about how well integrated that is for the rest of your communication strategy and go-to-market strategy? And maybe, are you creating more UCaaS products or other bundles of SD-WAN services to go after the business market? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: On the first comment, you have seen our strategy, how we address the market. I cannot comment on what our competition is doing. We feel good about our positioning with the promos we're coming out right now and it actually resonates with our customers, the migration path we have and all of that. So, I don't think that you're going to see from us anything like that. So, on the BlueJeans and collaboration tools, we are integrating that every day here in new settings, with new partners all the time, because this is a great asset and we are scaling it right now as we acquired it. So, that feels really good and we still have the whole 5G era and the mobile edge compute area which is going to need video conferencing, et cetera, or communication services. So, there is a lot more to be done there. And we build that into the SD-WAN solutions where Tami and her team are continuously working with our customers that want to migrate right now and we have a great offerings in the market. So, we feel good about that, to be part of that transformation in the market, which is offsetting some of the wireline secular declines that we see as well. So, overall, I feel that we have a good position and a good work. Matt, anything more on that?\nMatthew Ellis: No. I think, look, the team has done a great job over the past 12 months. Remember, we closed this transaction during the pandemic. So, the ability to integrate and so on, we've done it all virtually and remotely. And so, a lot of good work going on. And as you mentioned, Tim, we see an opportunity for us to broaden the offerings that we have with our enterprise customers and seeing good traction there. So, I think they've done everything we expected to do at this point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.\nFrank Louthan: Can you walk us through plans for the balance sheet? And then, in particular, would you consider monetizing any assets like Verizon Media and so forth to delever? And how we should think about the timing for delevering, if that's changed at all since the Analyst Day? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Our capital allocation priorities are the same as we said before. Number one, we invest in our business and I think we've been very clear what we're investing right now and the CapEx and the incremental CapEx for the C-Band.  Then, secondly, we have clearly outlined we're going to put our Board in the position to continue to grow the dividend. Matt and I feel really confident about that.  And then, thirdly is to do as we did after the Vodafone acquisition, to come down again to pre-Vodafone, we call that pre-COVID or pre-C-Band right now, because we want the change here, or a little bit fashionist, so we're doing that. And we see a great moment for that and we have basically a plan for that, given how we're going to generate growth and cash flow over the years. And as Matt outlined when we spoke about this last time, four to five years is what we believe is going to take us to get there. So, that's what we have in play right now and no other things are included or no other new updates neither.  So, we are just happy with the first quarter where we generated very good cash, which means that the first quarter is in there for us to start doing our work to get back to the pre-C-Band sort of financial metrics.\nMatthew Ellis: Hans, building on that, the leverage is \u2013 no change since the Investor Day. Good first quarter results. As you think about the revenue targets we've given for the five years, certainly on track there. The only other balance sheet update I'll give you is just on the cash balance. We've obviously had that elevated level since the start of the pandemic. Given the progress we've seen since the start of the first quarter in terms of the vaccination rates in this country and then also the stimulus getting past, we didn't know if that was going to happen or not. And now having the auction behind us, we do think that there is the opportunity for us to start moving cash to what was closer to something of pre-pandemic level. So, now that we've got all those things done. And as we get into the second quarter here, we'll start work on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. \nColby Synesael: Maybe just a follow-up on that. Free cash flow was pretty strong in the quarter, $5.2 billion. It seems like there were some benefit on the working capital side. Just curious if you talk about how you see that progressing through the remainder of the year and might be implied in terms of free cash flow for the year based on your target of 2.8 turns of leverage by year-end 2021. And then, secondly, I'm not sure if you'll able to give it, but I'm curious if you can give us any color in terms of subscriber numbers for the fixed wireless product at this point. And also just from a housekeeping perspective, what line item are you actually including subs, if it's anywhere at all? And then also, where is the revenue for that being shown? Thank you.\nMatthew Ellis: Absolutely happy with the free cash flow performance in the first quarter. Obviously, working capital was part of the benefit in there. And as we look at that, there is a couple of things going in different directions. As we saw the increase in equipment volumes, we saw the device payables, the receivables related to that increase. As you would expect, that was a benefit on cash flow last year. We said that would be a headwind this year \u2013 hope to be a headwind this year. Absolutely saw that. Offsetting that a little bit was the volumes that we saw in March helped inventory levels, but also we saw really good customer payments in the month of March too as those stimulus payments hit. So, as I think about cash flow for the rest of the year, I would expect the device receivables to continue to be a little bit of a headwind as those return to a more normal level after the lower volumes last year. And then, obviously, we don't have cash tax payments in the first quarter. Those come through the final three quarters of the year. And as we mentioned, we had a couple of favorable items in there last year. So, still feel good obviously about where cash flow is going to play out. So, no update on our year-end leverage target at this point, but really nice to have a strong first quarter in the bank. In terms of the fixed wireless access subscribers, as those expand, we'll start to disclose them. In terms of where the revenue shows up, you're seeing that show up in service revenue as Fios broadband does today. So, that's where the revenue will show up in the income statement.\nColby Synesael: So it's actually in the Fios segment opposed to in the\u2026\nMatthew Ellis: No, no, no. Not the same. Fios revenue show up in service revenue. So, on the same fixed wireless access will also show up as service revenue. And then\u2026\nColby Synesael: On the wireless side?\nMatthew Ellis: It will be on the wireless service revenue, correct.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar: I guess on the margin front, when you look at the Consumer segment, you have a tailwind from Fios margins as that revenue stabilizes or potentially starts flatlining due to broadband or the mix shifts away from video. And then as volumes pick up and you focus a bit more on volumes over the course of this year, there is a tailwind \u2013 I'm sorry, there is a headwind from that. So if you could just talk about the puts and takes when it comes to margins over the course of the year in the Consumer business, that would be useful? And then, secondly, when you think about the stimulus that was passed in December, it looks like some of that money can flow to wireless consumer, the subsidy. The $3 billion subsidy for broadband, I guess, some of that could flow to wireless consumers as well. Are you guys starting to see some of that impact, how big of a tailwind do you expect that to be in the second quarter? Thanks.\nMatthew Ellis: On the Consumer margins, I think we've historically produced very good margins across the business there and I'd expect that to continue going forward. As you identified, there is always a number of puts and takes out there as we move forward, and certainly, Fios is performing very well and is contributing nicely to that. But as you also rightly pointed out, equipment volumes were up significantly year-over-year. And obviously, that increases the denominator in the margin calculation without really increasing the numerator. So, you've got a number of different puts and takes. You'll have the ongoing impacts of building out the network in there as well. But we feel very good about the margins that we'll have for the rest of the year within Consumer, very much in line with what you would expect. And then, certainly, the seasonality showing up in the fourth quarter with the seasonal volumes that you would expect to see over the course of the holiday period. So, it's certainly to continue to be on track to give the \u2013 to meet the EPS guidance we have for the year, Consumer margins need to be a strong contributor to that and I expect they'll be. In terms of stimulus benefits, as I think I mentioned in the comment about working capital, we're seeing very good payment patterns from consumers at this point. And that's where I think we'll see the vast majority of any benefit show up. So, those payments were very strong in the first quarter, and I suspect the stimulus bills had something to do with that. But it means that our consumers are in very good shape as compared to where they otherwise might have been given the impacts of the pandemic going into the second quarter and we feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year ahead of us.\nBrady Connor: Everybody, we're done for today. Thank you very much for the participation and we'll see you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect."}], "2023": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-01-24 11:52:02", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website, a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results. I hope you all had a chance to read the material. I'm going to briefly discuss the financial highlights before turning the call over to Hans to lead a discussion on our strategy, guidance and forward-looking view of the business. Slide 3 shows a summary of our results. Consolidated total operating revenue was $35.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 3.5% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter benefiting from unlimited plan migrations, our best fourth quarter total postpaid net additions in seven years, pricing actions that we began implementing in June of 2022 and a full quarter contribution from TracFone. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.7 billion for the fourth quarter, down 0.2% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by higher promotional expense, declines in our high-margin legacy wireline business and inflationary cost pressures. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $1.19, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the similar period in 2021, driven by higher interest expense, depreciation and lower pension-related income. Finally, we delivered $14.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2022 and exited the year with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. On today's earnings call, I will focus on our strategy, guidance, expectation for the business and why I'm so excited about the opportunities for the year ahead.  Let me start by saying that we delivered against all of our revised financial targets provided in July, including 8.6% wireless service revenue growth, $47.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $5.18. I'm pleased that the momentum built during the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we set the expectation of a positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter, and we delivered against that expectation. Although we have more work to do, I'm encouraged by the improvement and expect to build on the momentum in 2023. The improvement in the consumer performance was complemented by yet another strong mobility quarter in Verizon Business Group as well as continued success in fixed wireless access with net adds up sequentially in both consumer and business. Together with FiOS result, we added 416,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, our best total broadband performance in over a decade and approximately 1.3 million total broadband net adds for the year. Regarding our guidance, we have positioned ourselves to improve on our performance in 2023 and expect to build a good underlying operational momentum, although that will be offset by the impact of the noncash factors, such as promo amortization in our revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, we're seeing some impact of high interest rates. At the same time, we expect our capital spending to reduce significantly in 2023 as we reach the end of our incremental C-band spending, which will be a tailwind for free cash flow. We're striving to make further improvement and take even more actions that will ultimately lead to better performance than the guidance we have outlined today. Matt will discuss the guidance in more detail later in the call. The industry enters 2023 with continued macroeconomic uncertainty as elevated inflation and interest rates impact the broader economy. Still, demand for our service remains strong, given the growing importance of mobility and broadband to both consumers and businesses. The combination of our network reliability, diverse portfolio of products and services and the industry's strongest customer base provides us the flexibility to meet the changing customer needs even in a difficult economic environment. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders by our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Taking these three metrics together is how we hold ourselves accountable. We're well positioned to improve our performance and accelerate growth on a go-forward basis with network quality as the foundation for our strategy and growth. We expect the wireless mobility and nationwide broadband will be the most significant contributor to Verizon's growth for the next several years. In 2022, we made important progress in each of these businesses. Our growth in these areas will be driven by extending our network advantage using our C-band spectrum, which we expect will strengthen our network leadership in the coming years. We are taking a balanced approach on how we run our business, adding the right customers and generating ongoing profits from them is how we maximize value. We remain focused on our cost reduction and efficiency actions, while also maximizing our return on invested capital via better monetizing our assets to put us on track to improve free cash flow going forward. We're proud of being the strongest in the industry in terms of generating cash and want to preserve that while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We're executing with discipline and will continue driving a strategy which produces sustainable long-term growth and profitability.  As connectivity plays an increasingly important role for consumers and businesses, it is the quality of the connectivity that matters the most. Not all networks are architected and built the same, nor have the same quality. We have seen these differences in the past and expect that 5G will be no different. Our engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist even as capital intensity declines in the coming years. In the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our company's history. We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POP targeted by year-end 2024. C-band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-band spectrum later this year. Due to the timing of spectrum availability, our deployment strategy targets the highest usage areas first with the capability to deliver the most distinguished experience in places where the majority of our customers consume mobile services. As additional spectrum is cleared, we will have access to many new markets. As with prior generations of wireless technology, customers in all areas can expect to receive the best network experience. And where we have built out the C-band, we're only getting started. Early deployments have limited to 60 megahertz or 100 megahertz in some early clearance markets. Consumer performance in this market has been encouraging as is evidenced by better retention, more favorable gross add trends and higher premium uptake. In addition, the majority of our consumer fixed wireless net adds are on C-band. With the final tranche of spectrum expected to be available in late 2023, we can deploy an average of 161 megahertz and up to 200 megahertz in certain markets across the entire Continental U.S. When we turn on the full breadth of spectrum, we expect peak download speeds to reach 2.4 gigabits per second, up from the 900 megabits per second we see with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more users and applications. At the same time, we're also deploying our 5G standalone core. So by the end of the year, you should see a network with incredible speeds, both downlink and uplink and positioned to deliver 5G capabilities such as network slicing, voice over 5G NR among others. We believe our network will allow us to maintain our premium position with our wireless mobility customers and provide reliable fixed wireless access services to consumers and businesses across the country. This is an example of how we can monetize our multipurpose network by scaling several revenue streams on the same infrastructure to enhance our return on investment. We're adding far more capacity to our network than the peak usage increase we\u2019re expected in fixed wireless markets. We continue to expect that we will have 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless subscribers by the end of 2025, and those subscribers will be enabled by our current build and capital plans. Our mobility and broadband plans are supported by our deep fiber position and ongoing fiber investments. Approximately 50% of our sites are now served by our own fiber, up from 45% last year. We believe we are the only provider serving the level of its wireless network with its own fiber. This supports superior quality of services and end-to-end owners' economics. That means better reliability and higher margins and look for us to continue to expand the percentage of sites on our own fiber. We also expanded our FiOS footprint by over 550,000 locations in 2022, extending our FiOS open for sales to more than 17 million locations. You can expect continued fiber expansion in the years ahead. In summary, network quality is the foundation for our strategy and growth. And all of the moves we are making are focused on ensuring we continue our network leadership in the future. As I mentioned earlier, Verizon's success should be measured against three important metrics: service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Let me now cover each of these in detail and tell you why I'm so confident in our ability to deliver against all three of these benchmarks. We expect that our network differentiation will be the cornerstone of our service revenue growth and that it will allow us to continue to attract the highest quality customer base in the industry and maintain our market-leading share of the B2B market. Our fixed wire access is also expected to contribute more meaningfully to service revenue as we enter the year growing rapidly with a base of more than 1.4 million subscribers. 2022 demonstrated to us that we need to be even more agile and responsive in the consumer market. This is one of the reasons I assume leadership of the business late last year. We are moving into 2023 with momentum and expectation for improved performance based on recent actions and planned initiatives. After integrating TracFone over last year, we now have a full complement of offerings from entry-level prepaid all the way up to premium unlimited postpaid plans for the first time in our history. This will enable us to better attract new customers while also retaining customers through their mobile journey. You have already seen us take more segmented approach to the market through the Welcome Unlimited and One Unlimited plans in postpaid and the launch of Total by Verizon in prepaid. We're already seeing the benefit from these actions. In 2023, our plans will continue to evolve as we look for the best ways to cater to our customers, whether through network experience, content or other product offerings. Each new offering gives us an opportunity to engage with the prospective customers and ensure they receive a plan that best fits their needs. We remain disciplined around our core pricing and continue to perform well with our premium customers on retention and step-up activity. As we move into 2023, we're taking a more localized approach with our network and go-to-market strategy, providing greater autonomy to the teams on the front line and speeding up the pace of decision-making. This will allow us to compete more effectively across geographies, particularly where dynamics may differ by individual market. Finally, we continue to revise our sales compensation structure, ensuring we have the right incentives in place to drive sales growth. The customers we have and continue to attract represent the highest quality customer base in the industry. Based on our customer payment patterns, which are at or better than pre-pandemic levels, and the low delinquency rates in our securitized device payment plan portfolios, we continue to see only a limited impact from the macroeconomic environment on our customers. While we are watching this closely, we have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our customer base. Scaling of new business, such as private 5G networks and edge computing will also be a strategic focus in 2023. Our funnel is strong, and we're making the appropriate investment to ensure such services provide a meaningful contribution to future growth in the years ahead, which differentiates us in the industry. You can expect Verizon to compete, but I want to underline again that we will not sacrifice financial for volumes. We continue to focus on improving our cost of acquisition and retention and believe current promotional incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long run. Although we have participated, to some extent, in this dynamic, expect us to pursue more ways to move away from the aggressive handset subsidies with offers like Welcome Unlimited plan, which offers attractive headline pricing for customers while reducing device subsidies. We manage the business for profitability and such actions drive healthy lifetime value for the business. Moving to Business Wireline. We're taking several actions to reduce the financial impact of the unit and are scaling back on pursuing low margin revenue in order to again drive improved profitability. While this may result in missing out on revenue, it is a right move and one that will lead to higher margin and cash flow over time. At the same time, we are focused on further improving the cost structure through greater efficiencies. You may recall that we embarked on a new cost-cutting initiative late last year. The component of this initiative is the formation of Verizon Global Services. This organization is accelerating efforts to drive cross-functional efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest savings in network superiority and customer growth while contributing to long-term profitability. Additional opportunity exists in sourcing, sales and marketing and corporate system, among others. The heavy lifting is now underway as we execute against our goal to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of run rate savings by 2025. So our EBITDA strategy is clear. Grow profitable volumes in both consumer and business based on our increasingly differentiated network and manage our expenses the way you would expect us to do. By growing service revenue and EBITDA, we believe that we will be able to provide our shareholders with increasingly healthy free cash flow, which will support the strength of our balance sheet and fund our dividend growth. Our current streak of raising the dividend 16 years in a row is unmatched in the industry, and we intend to be able to continue that trend. Because our mobility and fixed wireless access products leverage the same infrastructure, they provide a capital-efficient path to future cash flow growth. We believe that we will become increasingly efficient with our capital, using less capital to generate every dollar of revenue for years to come. That will enable us to produce expanding cash flow that we can both reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders. And as you know, we're doing all of this as our capital spending budget is expected to decline from $23.1 billion in 2022 to under $19 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range this year, a reduction of nearly 20% year-over-year. In 2024, we expect our CapEx to be around $17 billion, which we expect to represent the lowest capital intensity in over a decade and among the lowest in the industry. We expect we will deliver a best-in-class network experience while reducing our 2022 CapEx levels by more than $5 billion over the next couple of years. With that, I turn it over to Matt to discuss guidance.\nMatthew Ellis : Thank you, Hans, and good morning. I want to spend some time walking you through our 2023 guidance while also commenting on our longer-term outlook. Our 2023 guidance reflects momentum we have exiting 2022, which we expect to drive wireless service revenue growth. For 2023, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, driven by increased penetration of premium unlimited plans, scaling of fixed wireless, continued growth in products and services, such as content and device protection plans and the full year impact of our pricing actions taken in 2022. As noted in our earnings materials, our wireless service revenue growth outlook includes an approximately 190 basis point benefit from a larger allocation of our administrative and telco recover fees, which partially recovered network operating costs to wireless service revenue from other revenue. In addition, we expect promo amortization to be approximately $1 billion higher than last year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within a range of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue offset by wireline and other revenue declines and higher marketing and network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.55 to $4.85. As noted on our third quarter earnings call, high interest rates are expected to result in approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of interest expense pressure in 2023 due to higher floating rate debt costs and higher securitization costs for our growing device payment portfolio. We continue to believe we have the right debt structure for the long term and have managed the balance sheet appropriately by keeping short-term maturities to a minimum in this higher interest rate environment. Higher rates of pension and OPEB, in addition to the lower pension asset base resulting from negative returns in 2022, are also expected to impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.15 compared to 2022. This flows through other income and expense in our income statement. Finally, we expect approximately $0.03 to $0.05 of impact from higher depreciation expense primarily driven by the C-band equipment being put into service across '22 and into '23. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.0% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, including the final approximately $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion of C-band-related capital spending and we continue to expect total capital spending to be approximately $17 billion in 2024. The reduction from the $23.1 billion CapEx in 2022 is expected to drive higher free cash flow in 2023 despite increases in cash interest and cash taxes. As previously discussed, we will complete our accelerated $10 billion C-Band program this year after which all C-band capital expenditures will be part of our business-as-usual capital program. Looking beyond 2023, given our exit rate from 2022 we don't expect to hit the long-range outlook as we projected at the Investor Day last year. However, due to the way we have positioned our network and service offerings coming into 2023, we do expect increasing growth in revenue and cash flow in subsequent years. I will now turn it back over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Matt. Let me summarize the Verizon opportunity in a few key points. We are making the necessary improvements to drive better performance. We have the best network, and it's only getting better even as capital intensity improves. We have the largest EBITDA base in the industry and a clear path to free cash flow expansion. And finally, we have one of the most attractive dividends in the market and we intend to be able to continue the trend of growing the dividend each year. By that, I hand it over to Brady to start the Q&A.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions. .\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery : I had a couple of questions on the guidance. The first one is how are you thinking about your confidence and the visibility of this guide as compared to a year ago. Obviously, we had the war and stuff like that. But I think the reductions in guidance, obviously, were a concern for investors. So as you went through this process was it deliberate conservatism that you were trying to bake in to make sure that you could hit, and I think, Hans, you might have mentioned exceed the guidance with additional steps. So that kind of setup would be great. And then I guess for Matt, you called out some of the pressures on the bottom line, but you had a $0.30 range on your EPS guide. I think it was $0.15 a year ago. And it sounded like on the items you gave, the range wasn't that wide. So perhaps you can just give us some color on what caused you to be as wide this year on the EPS?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Simon. I can start. I mean when it comes to the guidance, I mean, we -- of course, it's a little bit uncertain, as we said, coming into the year, but we're laser focused on the service growth and on the EBITDA expansion and hence, also the cash flow expansion. And that's how we are running our business, and that's how we take decisions. And as I said, I mean, our job is, of course, to see that we are meeting or exceeding the guidance we've given out, and that's how we're going to work all the year. And our teams are set up to work like that. We are in the beginning of the year, so we're going to see how it turns out. But clearly, we have a super laser-focused in the whole company, how we're executing right now and how it hangs together.  And as I said before, we have now all the assets all the way from the network to our -- to the prepaid to the postpaid, all that. And from us, it's a lot of execution in a competitive market, but we definitely believe we can compete very well in that market. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Thanks, Hans. Good morning, Simon. So look, as you think about the guide for the year, obviously, there's a number of items in there, as I think about the range. We can get to the top end of the range there with strong execution, the activity around the cost program scaling, that flywheel moving faster than our base assumption. And just if we see more volumes come through the business there. Obviously, the low end will reflect the promo environment, the overall competitive environment and then we'll see items like inflation and so on. So the range of the EPS guide, I think very similar to the EBITDA guide that we've given. And I think it reflects as we come into this year, when you think about some of the unknowns will play out here in the macro environment and the competitive environment, we feel it's the right range to have for 2023. As Hans said, there's a lot of things for us to stay focused on, and make sure we produce the best result possible.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. \nJohn Hodulik : Can we talk about consumer margins within the guidance. They were down about almost 400 basis points in '22. And Matt and Hans, you guys gave some good color on some puts and takes around promotions around Verizon Global Services and I think, I guess, higher marketing and network operation cost. But I guess any other puts and takes to call out. And as we look into '23 as part of the guidance, should we expect the consumer margins to sort of flatten here? And do you guys have visibility that as you guys -- a lot of these initiatives take hold that we can start to see some improving margins on the consumer side?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. I mean, I can start. I mean, of course, we're doing quite a lot in the consumer segment right now, all the way from addressing areas where we have softness in our portfolio with Welcome, for example, in order to create growth. But also, we are regionalizing our business, both on the network side and the consumer side in order to take quicker decision, but also that the network is so strong in local markets where we're building out the C-band. We want to take advantage of that. And as we said before, we have the chance to -- or we don\u2019t have the chance. We see the correlation between C-band deployment and step-ups and of course, fixed wireless access and the majority of fixed wireless access customers coming on C-band right now. So that's why. And finally, we have also worked with the spending, the consumer investment, I call it, all the way what we're doing above the line on promo, what we're doing below the line on retention and how much we do in media. We're doing that much more agile. I think that will help us to manage and continue our clear path and a clear target of growing our top line and expanding our EBITDA. That's our job. Then there are some headwinds that Matt has talked about, but obviously, the underlying should be improving with the cost cuts and the way we're working in the consumer group. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. So as you think about the year-over-year reduction in '22. Remember, at the start of the year, we said that we expected about a 200 basis point impact because of the inclusion of TracFone in the business for the year. Obviously, accretive in absolute terms. But from a margin standpoint, we did expect to see that. So then obviously, there's some other items in there. We talked a little bit about the inflation impact last year. Obviously, the competitive environment and the promo piece in there as well. So there will be some things that we have the opportunity to improve on this year's synergies from within TracFone as we move more customers over to our own network will be an upside. But then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, obviously, the promo amortization is expected to be up on a year-over-year basis as the delay between being at these higher levels from a cash basis and then that flowing through on an accounting basis. So when you net those things out, expect something initially on a probably a similar type of level in '23 to '22 with some opportunities to push that as we go forward into subsequent years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : I'm actually going to stick with consumer. And I was hoping we can get a little more insight into two different tools you're using to go to market. The first is Welcome Unlimited, you've been advertising it quite a bit, and you've mentioned it a couple of times during your prepared remarks. I'm wondering to what extent are you finding that Welcome Unlimited is indeed a popular plan with new consumers versus the extent to which it's driving wireless shoppers into your channels where you're actually more frequently converting them into a higher-tiered plans? That's the first question. And then it seems like you have been reluctant to make greater use of device promos. Obviously, you were using them to some extent last year. How are you thinking about the role of device promos as you go to market this year and you look to sort of sustain these positive consumer phone net adds?\nHans Vestberg : The Welcome Unlimited is working exactly as we wanted. I mean it creates the store traffic. We bring our customers in and we see that the customer gets the plans they want. We have not seen any step downs of -- that is coming from that. We are more seeing an opportunity for our customers to have a conversation with them. And of course, remember, that's a bring-your-own-device. It's for 4 lines, and that's the way we've been dealing. And we learned a lot from the first Welcome we started with somewhere in the third quarter, I remember or beginning of -- end of the second when we saw a little bit -- and that was an area where we were soft. That's where we clearly saw that customers were going to others. These we now have diverted and they come to us. And if you then add that, you see our premium unlimited continue to do well. We went up now to 45% actually from 41% in the third quarter, I think. So we added 4% more on unlimited premium. So that is working for us. Just need to be agile, stay close to see which segment and then be aggressive in the segment we need and the segment we're performing well and we let them continue to perform well. And when it comes to device promos, yes, we understand that's part of the competition and in part of the market. We will be in part in that as well. But we will continue to be cautious and see that we actually are using device promos in the right moment for the right customers. And you saw us last year coming in and out. Sometimes we're a little bit more aggressive and others, we were actually the least aggressive. And I think that's how we will continue this year depending on where the market is going. But what you can expect from us in the consumer unit is to be agile, take quick decisions and see if they're working, then we'll continue. If they're not working, we're pulling them. That's why I'm into this basically every day myself nowadays. And I think this has proven that we get the momentum with the team, and the team is actually executing well. We have more to do. I mean I always say that. I mean, it's going to take a long time before I feel that I'm 100% satisfied or happy, but definitely, it's a work to do here, but I've seen the good momentum.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick : Sticking with wireless on service revenue, when I pull out the definition change from other to service revenue, you're guiding to roughly 1% to 2% wireless service revenue growth in '23, which is a big deceleration from almost 6% this quarter. How should we think about this in regards to phone adds and ARPU and the impact of promotions on service revenue? Can you just put the pieces together for us? And do you expect that service revenue will stay positive each quarter this year or actually flips to negative at some point? And just on top of that, typically, we see things much slower in terms of subscribers from 4Q to 1Q, while I don't expect you to guide on subscribers, do you think we'll see sort of typical seasonality this quarter? Or do you anticipate sort of better performance?\nHans Vestberg : I can start, and then Matt can break down the numbers you're talking about. I mean, yes, on the premium segment, there is seasonality in the first quarter, and I don't think that's going to be different this year. However, our work is to keep up the momentum that we had from the fourth quarter into this year, where we had good store traffic quarter-over-quarter and also high conversion rate. But it also means that we need agile and see what's happening in the market. And it's a little bit early to do any guidance or something like that, which we're not doing on net adds. But clearly, there is going to be seasonality, but we have good momentum, and we're going to continue to execute and be very close to the market. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes, Phil, so kind of unpacking some of the piece parts of your question there. So seasonality, absolutely, we expect that to look reasonably as you would expect throughout the year from an overall standpoint.  In terms of the service revenue guide, your math there is correct. When you think about the fourth quarter, you said close to 6%. Remember that included a full quarter of owning Trac in 4Q this year versus only part of 4Q last year. So as we get into '23, finally on a year-over-year basis to talk about stuff on an apples-to-apples basis and not with and without M&A items, which is nice. So once you remove that very similar.  In terms of the piece parts within wireless service revenue guide, think about you got the positive impacts of the price ups. Obviously, we had six months impact last year, approximately, you get a full year impact this year. Also the benefit of the FWA momentum we had and having 1.4 million subscribers in the base at the start of this year that we're billing throughout the year. But that's offset by the promo amortization, which, as I mentioned in the upfront comments will be higher in the income statement year-over-year, with the timing of the recognition of that. And then also the impact of the volumes last year, offsetting some of the ARPA benefit we had. So the task for the team going forward is to continue the momentum that we started to see in the second half of last year, as Hans mentioned, and that will put us in a position to continue to push service revenue in the positive direction going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden : The first one, maybe, Matt, could we refresh the free cash flow outlook for 2023? I think the midpoint was $21 billion for 2023 from last year's Analyst Day. I think if we look at the EBITDA guidance, which is roughly flat; interest expense guidance, which is up $1 billion; the CapEx, which is down $4 billion, it feels like it should be roughly $17 billion, unless there's other things in taxes and working capital related to some of these promotions. So if you could kind of refresh that a little bit, that would be awesome. And then Hans, you called out three things as it relates to the C-band deployment. And this has been a big success for Verizon is getting this build done. I think that some people have been asking themselves like where the return is from all the money that's been spent. And you highlighted higher retention, better gross adds and higher premium take rate. Are there numbers that you can put around that, that we could grab on to and say, \"Oh, when in 2024, Verizon doubles their footprint in C-band with the new spectrum getting cleared, we can put a number on that and say, \"Oh, this is going to be the return that Verizon gets from this build?\"\nHans Vestberg : Why don't you start, Matt, and I take the second question on the C-band.\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. So on the free cash flow, David, obviously, last year, we said that we expect -- you had the right number expectation of where we said free cash flow might be for \u201823. As I think about where we see the business today versus where it was a year ago, a couple of factors that are different. CapEx very much in line with where we thought it would be at this point. Team did a great job last year deploying C-band. And obviously, we spent most of the $10 billion. So you get a nice year-over-year benefit. Offsetting that cash taxes will be higher this year as we have less benefit from a higher CapEx number and also bonus depreciation dropping down. That was in our expectation last year. Interest rates were obviously very different than we expected last year. You touched on those. And then the jump-off point from the EBITDA in the business at the end of '22 to '23 lower than we hoped to be at the Investor Day a year ago. So you've got the right moving parts there. We're not guiding specifically to a cash flow number. We historically haven't. But you've got the right moving pieces in there. So net-net, the CapEx reduction year-over-year gives us a good tailwind to think about cash flow for this year. So with that, I'll hand you to Hans for the C-band question.\nHans Vestberg : Yes. And it's, of course, a focus for us to continue to grow the cash flow, as I said so many times. So we will continue on that work. When it comes to the C-band, first of all, we have said from the beginning, the C-band acquisition we did is a multi-decade spectrum. It's going to -- it's so much and in so many years. And of course, that was a deliberate decision because we believe we're going to be in wireless business for the eternity of Verizon's history. So that's very important. However, when it comes to C impacts, and I think I mentioned some of them, if you think about fixed wireless access, the majority of all new customers are coming on the C-band right now. That's a clear indication. Without the C-band, we couldn't grow the broadband right now. We did a history high 1.4 billion net adds in the year of broadband subscribers. So of course, a lot of contributor to C-band, and that's a clear metric to have. The other metrics you have is, of course, unlimited premium, where we say that actually, we're performing very well where we have deployed a C-band in order to get customers to step up. And the step-up is very important. We are in a multi-subscription business or we are in a subscription business. And the more you can see that you're upgrading the price, the P on that quantity, it's enormously important for a long-term value for our customers, important. The third one that is coming, and I mentioned also when I opened is, of course, private 5G networks, mobile edge compute, all that is, of course, going to be very much supported by the C-band as well. There we will come back and start reporting on that when we feel that, that is coming into the play from a more significant portion. But mobility -- and remember also that we had the wireless business side, the business side actually growing because of the reliability of our network and the resilience of our network, which is how our enterprise customers are buying from us when it comes to wireless business. So I think there are many metrics that you can see already now that is really connected to the C-band. Then I just want to remind you it's almost less -- I think it's one year since we got -- since we launched the C-band. It's only one year, and we're going to cross 200 million POPs. We have never built so fast in the entire history of the company, and we're well ahead of the plan to hit the 250 million POPs that we said at Investor Day by end of '24. So I think that this is really a game changer in the market. And we see performance-wise, we're outperforming. We have the most resilient 5G network in the nation and we are just starting, just starting with 60 and 100 megahertz. And as you heard me talking, we have 160 in average, it's going to be 200 later on. It is a game changer, and we can already see it right now, and we see already metrics right now that is proving it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. I'm sorry, Michael Rollins of Citibank, your lines is open.\nMichael Rollins : Two questions, if I could. The first one, as you mentioned earlier in the discussion that you pulled back from some of those longer-term targets that you had previously you added the 3-plus percent service revenue and other growth for this year and 4-plus percent for next year. Can you unpack the categories that are at or above the plan from a few years ago? And then the areas of shortfall and if those areas, do you view those as temporary or more permanent changes in the opportunity for Verizon?\nHans Vestberg : I can start. I mean, first of all, we're more confident than ever that we have the right strategy and we have the five vectors of growth. All of them are going along. Some are actually exceeding our expectations, some are a little bit slower and some have a little bit different jump-off points. That's where we are. But there's no difference how we see the market and how we believe we can compete in all the five vectors of growth that we outlined in the last time. It's more a push in time than something else because of this year or this year, in '22, I guess, I should say, had some jump off that is not really helping us. But all in all, the whole strategy, where we're going, I have a lot of confidence in our team. The team has a lot of confidence that we're executing. We're eliminating the things that have been distracting us, all the ways from Verizon Media Group, et cetera. Then we have some headwinds that we constantly work with as well that we don't talk so much about. On the wireline side, I talked about that today. I mean everything from the cost out. But not only that, we're going to be even more prudent, what type of business we're taking, which will reduce our top line probably, but it will improve our profitability and cash flow. So you're going to see us taking many actions to see that we are delivering on the long-term plans, but there are some shifts in it. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Mike, as you think about the conversation we had last year and we talked about the long-term outlook, we provided the piece parts. Maybe if I go through some of those and where we are. Some of them were absolutely where we expected to be. Think about nationwide broadband with the year we had on FWA, but also FiOS and the expectation to continue to see very good progress there. That's very much in line with the expectations we outlined a year ago. Also, our business segment mobility results with six consecutive quarters above 150,000 net adds, very much in line with the expectations that we had at the Investor Day.  A couple of areas where we are behind versus our expectation at that point in time. Firstly, you need to think one of them, the mobile edge compute and 5G private networks. You're talking about the technology adoption there on a new technology, that adoption curve. A little slower than maybe we would have liked, but as you heard from Hans in the prepared remarks, feel enough we're starting to see some momentum there. So I still feel good about the opportunity there, but the pace of the adoption curve a little different than we hoped it might be. But the upside there still looks very good. And then, of course, the other one, consumer mobility at this time a year ago, we had higher expectations for '22 than where we ended up. Obviously, a lot of that variance occurred in the first part of the year, and you saw the actions taken, but as you think about the piece parts of the long-term outlook that we described a year ago and then how those have played out in the past 12 months. Hopefully, that gives you a little more color in terms of where things are moving along very much in line and where we also saw some areas where we had to -- we have opportunity to see further improvement as we go forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.\nCraig Moffett : Sorry, I hope you can hear me. So Hans, I wonder if you could just talk a bit about your bundling strategy, particularly on the consumer side, with both the strength now in fixed wireless, but also FiOS. Is it your view that going forward, the consumer is going to buy wireless and wireline or fixed access together? Or is that more of a sort of a financial bundling strategy rather than a real product bundling strategy?\nHans Vestberg : Craig. No, I think it's a really good question. Of course, we have seen this has a very strong consumer movement in Europe that is, to a high degree, have convergence in the U.S. where, I would say, much lower. But clearly, it is something that our customers are asking for. So it's actually a consumer feedback. And I spent a lot of time in the stores, meeting a lot of our consumers. And they see a clear advantage to have the same provider on the broadband as on the wireless. I don't think we will get into any European levels. But clearly, this is a movement and Verizon is super good positioned here. We have owner's economics on our broadband and on our wireless nationwide, both of them. And that's, of course -- we're going to meet the customers here. If the customer thinks that is what they need, we're going to offer it, and that's why we have these bundles in the market. If they want to have them separate, we can do that as well. We have owners economics on both of them. But I think that trend will continue given the consumer research we're doing and the consumers we\u2019re talking to. That's something that is actually -- and it's not only consumers, you need to think about small and medium business as well, make it convenient for them, both having the wireless and the broadband. Because any SMB today -- and you know we spend -- we probably serve half of the SMBs in the country. Any SMB today need a digital front door and then being mobile first. So this is really good for us. And if you look at our numbers this year on both on fixed wireless access and mobility in the business segment, SMB has been very important for us. So yes, I think there's something in there definitely, and it's a consumer desire, and we're going to meet that desire as we continue.\nCraig Moffett : And are there big differences between the way you think about it in FiOS versus non-FiOS markets?\nHans Vestberg : No, it's not different. We see it in the same way if the customer, of course, we're much more mature historically in the FiOS footprint. On the other side, when we do fixed wireless access, it's a much more natural discussion with the customer as we have it from the beginning. So I would say that we probably have a big opportunity on the FiOS segment to have customers, both on the fixed and the mobile. On the fixed wireless access, I think that there, you start actually on a strong position when you start offering fixed wireless access with many of the customers sort of coming in either or cable provider and have our wireless, and that's how they move over to us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar : Hans, when we think about the balance between unit growth versus pricing, and obviously, there you have made a deliberate choice not to chase unit growth in near term. But could you help us think through how you think about this longer term? Because once you cede market share, obviously, it can be pretty expensive to get it back. And so when we think about this balance between pricing and unit growth, how important is unit growth, not just for short term, as you look at 2023, but also longer term, especially when it comes to postpaid phone growth.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. No, good question. I think that as you heard us at least, I mean, we think that the profitable growth is the most important, both to have the right customers retained with us and the ones we're getting. So that's an overarching measurement we need to have. Then, of course, it's always going to be new customers that are important for our base. But remember also, this market right now, if you talk about the premium segment, there are, of course, a certain amount of switchers in the market, and then there are a certain amount of people going from pre to postpaid. That is no infusion of new customers in the system. So they're coming from two sources. And you need to think about how you do that. And I think we have great opportunities right now with the TracFone brands we have to see and total wireless to see that we are taking care of that pre to post migration, which we've not been part of before. We still have some work with the IT stacks and all of that. But clearly, today, we're running on both sides. And on the switcher pool, yes, there we're going to be seeing that we're prudent and disciplined, but we will go for the units we think are the right. It's a subscription model long term that is even more important to increase the P sometimes than increasing the Q because this is long term that you stay with the customers to get the long-term value from them. But it's a balance of it all the time and that we will continue to have.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson : You talked about amortization being up $1 billion for phone subsidies to catch up with cash spending. Embedded in all your guidance is cash spending at peak levels? Is there a scope for it still to go higher? I know it depends on the competitive environment that it could eventually improve. But are we at peak levels, and it's just a question of amortization catching up. And I'm curious, when you think about the service revenue guide for wireless, are there any price increases anticipated in that guide? And kind of what level of price increase? I know it's a sensitive topic, but just curious how we should think about that revenue growth.\nHans Vestberg : Now if we talk about the price increases, I just want to come back to what I said before. I mean we will be surgical and segmented in our approach. There are certain segments we need to be more aggressive on. There might be areas where we see opportunities for price increases. There are no major price increases included at this moment. We need to see where the market is going and also where the cost levels are going. But we will always look at that, but it's nothing right now that we have in our plans. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. On the promotion piece, you've got the understanding of the accounting treatment versus the cash there, Doug, and certainly, our assumption is that the marketplace will continue to be competitive, but we're not going to go into the 100% details of what's in the guide there. But we do assume that we'll continue to see competitive level in line with the past couple of years. And then as Hans said, we'll continue to look for ways to put plans in the marketplace to reduce the level of subsidy out there as well, and we'll continue to push those opportunities.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. \nTim Horan : Matt, can you talk about your goals for free cash flow? And specifically, how much do you think you can reduce the debt buy per year kind of going forward at this point? And then secondly, can you talk about the gating factor for fixed wireless growth it seems like you're implying with your '25 guidance that this is kind of a good run rate, but yet your speeds are going to be increasing threefold and coverage, you're going to basically get a massive amount of capacity kind of going out there. But do you think this is a good run rate for fixed wireless or can accelerate?\nHans Vestberg : I can start with fixed wireless access. First of all, we just reiterated what we said in Investor Day, 4 million to 5 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. Our job is always to try to beat that, but that was -- we just reiterated that, and we are well ahead on that plan.  Then the second is, of course, when it comes to our capacity, we have definitely capacity for that and much more. And again, we have a multi-usage of our network that has been sort of the basis for this, meaning the same radio base stations are serving mobility, fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute, and we are not doing separate. In the distant future way above the 4 and 5, we can always come into sort of decisions of splitting cells in order to get more fixed wireless access but that\u2019s very far away from now. We have ample capacity for the guide and much more than that. So -- and of course, our team is doing everything to see that we can continue to exceed our targets.\nMatthew Ellis : Hey, Tim, on the free cash flow question. So absolutely, one of our goals is to continue to grow cash flow. Hans mentioned that you should measure us on revenue growth, EBITDA growth and cash flow growth and that cash flow growth is something we expect to be able to continue to generate going forward. Obviously, the capital reduction from the high point in '22 to the guide we gave for this year and then an even lower amount next year will be a positive towards that as we continue to obviously make progress on the income statement as well. You should see that contribute there as well. So that puts us in a position where we can start to see accelerated levels of debt reduction versus what you've seen in the past year or so. So that's the targets we have ahead of us and look forward to discussing progress against as we go forward here.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Great. Thanks, Tim. Brad, we've got time for on3 more question.\nOperator: The final question for today will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft : I wanted to ask you about business postpaid phone net adds. They seem to be a bit lighter this quarter than they've been in the past four or five quarters. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing trends there soften due to macroeconomic factors such as corporate staff reductions or if it's competitive reasons? Or is it any slowdown in the secular trend toward company-issued devices? And then related to that, can you talk about what you're assuming in the guidance at a high level for the macroeconomic environment. For example, are you assuming soft landing scenario with small macro impact? Or are you baking in a more protracted downturn in the guidance?\nHans Vestberg : Yes. So it's a multifaceted question on the fourth quarter. Of course, on the business-to-business side, SMBs continue very strong. And as I said, they need store digital storefront and a mobile-first strategy in today's world after COVID. So I think that we have been performing very well. On the enterprise side, it's a little bit different, but we see that bring your own device is going down, and we see more companies saying that they want the company phone, which is of course, helping us here. And that we -- that trend we have seen for a couple of quarters. So I think both of them are pretty solid. On the consumer side, as I said, we had positive net adds. We had also, as I said before, a little bit spill over from the churn from the price increase at the beginning of the quarter. And then there was actually fewer days of sales in the fourth quarter than a normal quarter. So I don't think there are any new things more than what I said. Customers were a little bit later in the holiday season to do. They had higher intent when it comes to consumers, but it was nothing macroeconomical different than I talked about. Matt and I talked about the bad debt and the delinquency being like pre-COVID or equal or better than pre-COVID. So no, there's nothing there. We are, of course, watching it. But so far, we continue to progress well.\nMatthew Ellis : Yes. Just to add on a couple of points. As you think about the VBG net adds, you're always going to see a little bit of volatility up and down from 1 quarter to the next just because of the size of some of the transactions there. So all in all, though, jobs numbers continue to be good; business numbers, good. Obviously, there's been some high-profile layoff announcements, but overall job numbers are good, and you see that show up in the overall numbers that we produced throughout the year and look forward to continuing to have best-in-class market share within the Verizon Business Group space as we go forward. In terms of the macroeconomic assumptions in the guide, I wouldn't say we have anything too dissimilar to what you've heard from a number of other people during earnings season. But one of the things I come back to is the resiliency of our customer base. We've been through different types of economic environments in the past. We know customers pay their phone bills before they pay other bills and other outgoings. We fully expect that to continue. And so we're obviously watching the macroeconomic environment. But as Hans said, the payment patterns continue to be very strong, and we'll stay close to that, but so far, so good.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Bryan. Brad, that's all the time we have today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-21 12:51:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor and I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now, let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.17 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported third quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $881 million. This includes a net pre-tax charge of approximately $645 million, primarily related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities and the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions of $236 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.32 in the third quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the third quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Last quarter, we told you we would take actions. Today, I am here to share the results those actions have delivered. We ended the third quarter with wireless service revenue growth up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially and adjusted EBITDA grew sequentially by almost 3% to $12.2 billion. We had total phone gross adds of nearly 2.6 million and about 5% year-over-year increase. This includes an increase in consumer of 1.3%, a significant improvement from minus 11% in the second quarter. These results are early indicators that the actions we are taking across our businesses to build momentum are gaining traction. Of course, we are not done yet. I continue to work with my team to take actions to grow revenue and to take cost out of our business to unlock the full potential of Verizon. I am glad to see sequential improvements based on our efforts, but there is more to do. Based on our momentum and plans, our financial guidance for 2022 remains unchanged. Throughout the call, you will hear the actions we took and the impact they have had on our business to position Verizon for growth. Our pricing actions in the second quarter in both our consumer and business groups helped increase our wireless service revenue. Postpaid phone net adds came in 8,000 for the quarter, with a loss from consumer offset by gains in Verizon Business. Matt will share more details with you later in the call. Let me turn to some of our group results. In Consumer, we have started to gain traction with customers reacting positively to our new offerings and as a result, increased store traffic. Our Welcome plan improved customers\u2019 pricing perception and contributed to consumer phone gross adds being up year-over-year. With the launch of the iPhone 14, we delivered a first-of-its-kind Apple 1 Unlimited bundle. Verizon customers now have access to Apple services all under one subscription. Apple remains a unique and trusted partner of Verizon, because they recognize our network quality and high-value customers. In the value segment, we launched Total By Verizon, redefining no contract wireless service, a key step in our continued integration of TracFone. And just this week, we introduced a prepaid wireless home Internet service on our Straight Talk brand. We continue to expand our offerings in the value segment and customers are taking notice. This helped also generate positive prepaid net adds for the quarter, our first positive quarter since second quarter 2021. For postpaid, we are focused on attracting and retaining high-quality consumers in a disciplined and measured approach. As we see areas of opportunity, we will address them in a surgical manner just like we have done with some of our recent actions. There is more progress to make. Our premium strategy is working. We ended the third quarter with 53% of our customers having a 5G phone and 81% of our base is on Unlimited plans. With a 42% uptake on Premium Unlimited, there is a great opportunity for step-ups. And we see that demand with approximately 60% of our new customers choosing Premium Unlimited right from the start. It is clear we have a high-quality customer base, so we will continue to focus on retention and winning these customers. Moving to Verizon Business, we see a continued very good momentum in both fixed wireless access and mobility. And I am encouraged also by the large 5G infrastructure deals we made in the quarter. These include digital transformation projects with Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Fujifilm and our continued work with the Department of Defense. And this is just a start. We recently announced an important agreement with the U.S. Department of State to modernize its communications infrastructure across embassies and other locations around the world. I am proud that we are partner of choice for these global enterprises and public sector clients. In broadband, our fixed wireless access and fire service continued to see strong demand. Total broadband net adds were 377,000, a sequential growth of over 40%. All of these services are built to deliver on top of our world-class network. We have a premium network and experience that our customers value and that demands premium pricing. Our network is a core value proposition. America relies on us and we deliver. This was evident before, during and in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. Our team did what we always do. We ran to the crisis, quickly restoring our network as needed and using our technology solution to protect impacted areas. Bottom line, our network infrastructure was resilient and our people delivered in the way that you have come to expect from us. Our mission has always been to build and operate the best, most reliable, highest performing network. Our use of advanced technologies, our spectrum portfolio and our expansive own fiber footprint, are critical to achieving that goal. Where we deploy our C-band, we see direct correlation to customer growth on both mobility and fixed wireless access. We are currently covering over 160 million POPs with C-band and on track to deliver 200 million within the first quarter of 2023. C-band usage is up 170% quarter-over-quarter and fixed wireless access now covers more than 40 million households. Right now, more than 48% of our cell sites are connected by Verizon\u2019s own fiber. We are expecting to be about 50% by year-end with the majority of our 5G sites already on our own fiber. This not only improves network performance, but also improves our owners\u2019 economics. At the same time, we are making efforts to take cost out of our business. We are constantly thinking about how we run our enterprise everyday to enhance our performance while delivering on our strategy. In this period, we have designed a company-wide cost savings program that we expect will save between $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2025. A first step in these efforts is the creation of a global service organization under the leadership of Craig Silliman. This is one part of our larger program to leverage cross-functional opportunities across the business. Over the past 2 years, under unprecedented circumstances, we have learned a lot about how we deliver our services to customers. Verizon global services will help unlock significant efficiencies and reduce cost across the business. Keeping in line with our company values and strategy, we continue to practice financial discipline even in a competitive market and delivered solid financial performance quarter-over-quarter. Verizon is in a strong position, no matter economical environment with our high-quality customer base, diversified go-to-market options, including our value offering, that benefits from strengthening our organization through our cost savings program and the best network that just keeps getting better. I will now hand it over to Matt to go deeper into our results.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans and good morning everyone. Our results from the third quarter were not yet where we would like them to be. But as you heard from Hans, the actions we have taken in the past two quarters are gaining traction in the marketplace. As a result, we saw positive developments in store traffic and consumer phone gross adds further gains in broadband and a sequential improvement in our financial results. We anticipate that we will be able to build on this momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s now walk through results from the third quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our strategy for mobility growth is to drive revenue growth by attracting and retaining high-quality customers and migrating them into premium tiers. Premium penetration in the consumer segment increased to approximately 42% at quarter end, a sequential increase in line with prior quarters even with the introduction of the Welcome plan and the current economic backdrop. As a result of the continued increase in Premium plan penetration, combined with the benefit from our admin fee increase and the impact from metered price-ups, consumer postpaid ARPA increased 3.8% year-over-year. Overall, phone gross adds were up approximately 5% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in business as well as the improvement in consumer gross adds. With the impact of 3Q churn, which increased as expected as a result of our recent pricing actions, phone net adds were 8,000 for the quarter. Business delivered 197,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter, their fifth consecutive quarter exceeding 150,000. The results were again balanced across the three customer groups, with enterprise delivering their best-ever phone net add performance and SMB and public sector both seeing double-digit phone gross add growth. On the Consumer side, postpaid phone gross adds were up 1.3% year-over-year, a notable sequential improvement from an 11% decline in Q2. The launch of the Welcome plan and the Apple One Unlimited plan helped to generate more store traffic while providing another avenue to compete outside of promotional spend. We have now seen year-over-year improvement in phone gross add performance for four consecutive months through September and anticipate another low single-digit year-over-year growth performance in the fourth quarter. As expected, the pricing actions we took around administrative fees and metered plans led to an increase in disconnects. With certain price-ups being phased in throughout the third quarter, we would anticipate some disconnect pressure to carryover into Q4. Taken together, we currently expect the gross add and disconnect performance to result in positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. Total broadband net adds were 377,000 in the quarter, reflecting a strong demand for reliable and high-value broadband offerings. Fixed wireless access momentum continued throughout the third quarter. We added 342,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in 2Q, reflecting increased demand across business and consumers. More than 75% of our consumer net adds are coming from urban and suburban locations with data usage that continues to mirror our Fios customers. We anticipate further share gains in this space as we continue to expand our household coverage and begin to realize benefits from our offering in the prepaid segment. We also added 61,000 Fios Internet net adds during the third quarter, reflecting improved gross outperformance from Q2 as well as continued strong retention levels. Our ability to grow Fios in spite of some secular headwinds due to lower move activity shows that the quality, value and reliability that Fios offers, continues to resonate strongly with customers. We further expanded our nationwide broadband opportunity by adding more fixed wireless households and businesses covered as well as growing our Fios open-for-sale within our ILEC footprint. Total fixed wireless household coverage surpassed 40 million in the quarter, including over 30 million covered by 5G Ultra Wideband. Fios open for sale is now at 16.9 million, a year-to-date increase of 410,000 and we remain on track to hit our full year target of 550,000. Now, let\u2019s talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our work to integrate TracFone continues, highlighted by the launch of our new prepaid brand, Total By Verizon, late in the quarter as well as the launch of fixed wireless for our prepaid customers earlier this month. For the quarter, we delivered positive prepaid net adds of 39,000, which excludes a base adjustment of 102,000 primarily relating to a competitor\u2019s 3G network shutdown. We saw significant improvement in TracFone\u2019s performance, which had positive net adds for the first time since Q1 2021. With our current momentum, combined with the launch of our new brand and fixed wireless, we are excited about our positioning and ability to further grow in the value market, bringing more connectivity and benefits to customers in this space. Now, let\u2019s move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was up 4.0% year-over-year as wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue more than offset wireline declines and the net impact of last year\u2019s M&A activity. As a reminder, the third quarter last year only had 2 months of Verizon Media activity before its divestiture. Total wireless service revenue growth was up 10.0% from the prior year primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, continued effectiveness of our Premium Unlimited strategy and business volumes. The core business is strong as wireless service revenue, excluding all TracFone activities, grew above 3%. Additionally, we saw a benefit from the pricing actions taken earlier in the year, which we previously said would generate roughly $1 billion across Q3 and Q4. These actions helped to generate a sequential increase of $494 million in wireless service and other revenue and an increase of $345 million of adjusted EBITDA as total adjusted EBITDA came in at $12.2 billion for the quarter. We continue to feel the pressures of higher device subsidies and promotional spending despite taking steps throughout Q3 to be disciplined, including the launch of the Welcome plan, which comes with our device subsidy. Inflationary pressures remain elevated both from a year-over-year and sequential point of view with the increase from Q2 primarily coming from higher electricity rates. Expectations for full year 2022 impacts of inflation remain consistent with comments during our Q2 earnings call. To further mitigate inflation impacts, we have started a new cost savings program that we expect will provide a reduction in annual cost of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2025. This program will be focused on several areas within the business, including digitalization efforts to enhance the customer experience and streamlining internal operations through automation and process enhancements. While part of this will benefit the bottom line, a portion of these savings will be reinvested into the business to help accelerate opportunities. As Brady noted, adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.32. In addition to the impact from EBITDA, this reflects sequential pressures in interest expense due to rate increases and a reduction in other income associated with non-cash changes to pension and OPEB. Based on year-to-date interest rate increases and market expectations for additional Federal Reserve actions this year, we now estimate cash interest expense for 2022 to be about $400 million higher than our expectation coming into the year. We anticipate this pressure will continue into next year given the full year impact from interest rate increases, providing an EPS headwind in 2023. Likewise, the impact from non-cash pension cost due to higher interest rates and lower return on assets this year is expected to put additional pressure on below-the-line items for 2023. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our third quarter consumer financial results. Total consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.8% year-over-year driven by wireless service revenue growth of 11.0% as well as higher equipment revenue. Wireless service revenue increases were the result of the inclusion of TracFone, core wireless service revenue growth and the impact of the pricing actions. Total Fios revenue was up versus the same period a year ago by 0.3% as growth from our Internet base offset the revenue impact of a 9% year-over-year decline in video subscribers. Fios content costs have also dropped resulting in an improved margin profile that we expect will continue to benefit from further shifts away from video. Consumer EBITDA was $10.6 billion, up 0.7% compared to the same period last year. The pricing actions as well as the full inclusion of TracFone results more than offset the pressures from higher promotional activity and the impact of inflation. Next, let\u2019s take a closer look at the Business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment\u2019s wireless results remained strong in 3Q, though wireline service revenue declines continued due to ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 5.7% was up from 3.0% last quarter, aided by pricing actions as well as continued growth in our customer base. Wireline revenue declined by 6.7% versus prior year. Operating trends are consistent with prior quarters. Though in Q3, we saw a sequential increase in USF revenue due to higher rates. Business EBITDA was $1.8 billion for the quarter, down 6.7% from the prior year. In addition to pressure from wireline, we experienced higher growth related costs as wireless sales volumes were up by 15% from the prior year. Now let\u2019s move on to Slide 13 and the cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three quarters of 2022 totaled $28.2 billion compared with $31.2 billion in the prior year period as working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels continue, as we expected. Capital spending for the first three quarters of the year totaled $15.8 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to last year. C-band spending was $4.5 billion for the first 9 months of the year. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $12.4 billion for the first three quarters of the year. We exited the quarter with $129.3 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $1.3 billion, resulting in a net unsecured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. As Hans mentioned earlier, our low unsecured bond maturities over the remainder of this year and next and strong operational cash flow generation puts our balance sheet in a strong position. Payment trends remain at or better than pre-COVID levels, and the quality of our postpaid base has never been better as evidenced by recent asset-backed securities prospectus filings. As we look at Q3 results, we delivered the sequential revenue and EBITDA growth that we had anticipated from the actions taken in 2Q. Our guidance for 2022 remains unchanged. We are building momentum and remain confident that our strategy will deliver strong cash flow growth into the future. It is this confidence, combined with the health of our balance sheet, that enabled us to recently increase our dividend for the 16th consecutive year. We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders, and we intend to continue to put the Board in a position to approve annual increases. I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. The actions we have taken are showing progress, but there is more work to be done. Our priorities through the end of the year and into 2023 are straightforward: continue our traction in Consumer wireless through the holiday season and into 2023; maintain and grow our momentum in fixed wireless access and Business wireless; implement the initial framework of a cross-functional efficiency program and improve our working capital efficiencies; and finally, continue our measured and strategic approach to the market with financial discipline and increased momentum for the quarters to come. While there is work to be done, I\u2019m confident that we are well positioned to deliver. So thank you. Now we\u2019re ready for your questions. Brady, back to you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we\u2019re ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Two quick ones, if I can. First, I know you guys don\u2019t \u2013 you often hold off on giving guidance until the fourth quarter call, but it sounds like you got a number of sort of below-the-line headwinds to growth next year. But what\u2019s the prognosis for EBITDA growth in \u201823 given all the moving parts and all the cost savings you have coming through? And then secondly, on postpaid phone churn, it ticked up. And just looking for clarifications on Matt\u2019s comments that it\u2019s going to stay elevated. How do you expect that to progress as we move through \u201823? And what do you think is really driving? It sounds like you obviously you had the price increase. But just fundamentally, are the prices at Verizon just too high at this point given what we\u2019re seeing from a macro environment and given the \u2013 something approaching network parity that we have in the market today? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, John. I can start and Matt will fill in. I mean when it comes to the quarter and the gross adds and the churn, I think what happened is that we came out from the second quarter where the soft quarter on the Consumer side when it comes to gross adds. We added a couple of new products all the way from the Welcome plan to the price adjustments. And of course, the outcome we were expecting was that we continue to grow both ARPA, but also our wireless service revenue. And as you heard, we grew the service revenue with 3.5% if we exclude TracFone, but then with TracFone. So that clearly is working for us, and we will continue to do that. But we will do it in certain segments where we see weakness. I mean we also saw a very strong continuation in our premium segments, where we continue to have now more than 81% of consumers on unlimited and 42% on Unlimited Premium. So we \u2013 that area is going well. So we just need to find those areas, and we will continue to do that. But I think that we have a very competitive pricing in the market. We add that with values like the one plan with Apple right now at Apple One Unlimited, et cetera, and we have more to come. So it\u2019s \u2013 for us it\u2019s a grind it to see that we do the right in the segment. And of course, we have the largest consumer base in the market. So we just need to see that we\u2019re doing this in the right way. And ultimately, our goal is to continue to grow our EBITDA. And you saw this quarter, we grew our EBITDA ;with almost 3%. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and we keep our guidance for the full year. So we \u2013 that\u2019s our job. And then on top of that, we take out costs. So I think all in all, that\u2019s what we\u2019re working with constantly here. And it\u2019s a big ship we\u2019re moving. I think that this quarter, we saw all the actions we took in the second quarter having impact \u2013 positive impact. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re done. We think we can do more and we have more to do. So that\u2019s sort of the summary of where I think we are and how we\u2019re executing, and we will continue to execute in this quarter and the quarters to come.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. And John, so maybe the second part of your question first around churn and is our pricing in the right place, I\u2019d point you to the fact that our gross adds were up almost 5% on a year-over-year basis in 3Q. So obviously, our offerings continue to resonate with customers, obviously, built on having the best network, and consumers continue to see the value of that. So continue to believe that the gross add traffic will be there, and we will get our fair share. On the churn side, just to put it in perspective, the pricing actions we took across both the metered plans and the fees touch more than 75 million phone customers. And so the uptick in churn that we saw in the quarter was highly expected. We kind of mentioned that 90 days ago that we expected it to happen. But the financial benefits came through as well, which was exactly as we expected and was the right approach to take. So obviously, the impact of those changes will mitigate as we go forward here, and we will continue to make sure that our churn is where it needs to be to ensure the right results. In terms of the first part of your question, you\u2019re right, we will speak to you more specifically about 2023 on the next call. We\u2019re obviously in the middle of our planning cycle right now. But you should certainly expect us to build on the momentum that you saw us deliver in the third quarter. You saw that wireless service revenue up sequentially 2%. As Hans mentioned, EBITDA up sequentially about 3%, that gives us a good platform to build on here in 4Q and then as we head into \u201823. And then you mentioned below the line, there will be some pressures next year. I\u2019m not going to quantify those now. But as you think about the specifics of those, some of those we\u2019ve spoken to all of you about before. When we came out of the C-band auction, we said that we would expect depreciation to increase and capitalized interest to reduce as we\u2019ve deployed C-band sites and put them on there and really having kind of significant year-over-year impacts in \u201823 and \u201824. So that\u2019s in line with what we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. And then you layer on top of that, obviously, interest rates are higher, and we will have a full year impact of that next year. And that impacts both the interest expense line, but also other non-cash below-the-line items around pension and OPEB, where the imputed interest cost will be higher with the higher macro rates and then also starting the year with lower assets because of the performance this year. So we will obviously quantify those things. But as we think about \u201823, we had good momentum coming out of 3Q on a sequential basis, look to build on that in 4Q, continue to generate significant amounts of cash flow that puts us in a position to be successful going forward.\nJohn Hodulik: All right. Thanks for all the detail, guys.\nHans Vestberg: Yes.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, John. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. It\u2019s about your sort of emerging nationwide broadband strategy. So I think you mentioned that you can now offer the fixed wireless product to over 40 million potential customers. I think from your Analyst Day last year, the ultimate target is 64 million with 50 million of that being residential and the rest being business. You\u2019re also \u2013 and you made a point about this, you\u2019re deploying a lot of fiber, primarily just to put your mobile network on a national basis. And so the real question is, now that you have seen the fixed wireless product perform and what it does on the network side of things, how are you thinking about that target of eventually reaching 64 million homes? You think it could potentially be greater? And then yesterday, AT&T talked about evaluating opportunities to do more of a fiber-to-the-home strategy out of region. I imagine leveraging some of the fiber they are deploying in their wireless network. Considering how expansive your national fiber footprint is becoming, is that something you\u2019re evaluating as well? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. When it comes to our national broadband strategy, first of all, I think it\u2019s working really good for us. You saw in the quarter adding 377,000. The Fios footprint continue to be extremely high-quality customers and continue to grow. We will continue to expand that footprint. Outside that, we, of course, have a very high focus on fixed wireless access because the speed to market, because the demand in the market right now is high for broadband. And of course, we have a very disruptive model where it takes low single digits minutes to actually get broadband at home. It\u2019s a total different product when it comes to fixed wireless access. So we capture the market as soon as we can right now, and you see on our growth rates that is happening both for Consumer as for Business. But as you rightfully said, we are deploying the network as we speak, and we are just into certain markets given on the C-band, we will have more and more markets. And as we stated in the remarks, I mean, we are now covering 40 million households with our fixed wireless access. So we will continue to expand that, and we have plans and execution. It\u2019s working well. The quality is improving. The customer satisfaction is really high on fixed wireless access and of course, there are the competition in these areas are of course not equally good customer satisfaction. So no, I think \u2013 we think \u2013 we are confident that this is a good strategy for us. Then when it comes to our fiber, you\u2019re absolutely right. We have done enormous investment in fiber. We want owners\u2019 economics on our network, and we are getting that because with the majority of all the 5G sites have our own fiber, and we\u2019re now passing 50% by year-end on all our sites. Some sites will never need fiber. So it\u2019s not like 100% is the end goal. But in order to have a good experience for our customers, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Then we want to see opportunities, especially for the Business side to use that fiber footprint outside. I\u2019d like to see that some customers can get a better or we can substitute third-party fiber that we are getting from others. But clearly, focus on fiber in the Fios footprint, fixed wireless access going as fast as we can outside that. So yes, we are confident about the strategy, and it\u2019s working. We have talked about for several years. We come out with new products, that\u2019s going to be multi-spectrum. That\u2019s going to handle everything from 4G, C-band, 10-millimeter wave. So the resilience and the performance and quality of the products is even getting better. So yes, that\u2019s where we are.\nMatt Ellis: Brad, I\u2019ll just add one thing. You mentioned fiber to the home. Of course, our Fios team had another good quarter here, 61,000 net adds despite a low-mover environment. So as Hans said, we\u2019re very focused on doing broadband through fixed wireless access, but our Fios business continues to perform very strongly and add customers to that network. And we continue to build more open for sale in our Fios footprint. And just as a point to note, 3Q was a milestone for Fios in terms of going over 7 million connections with \u2013 for that business. So it continues to perform very strongly. And then we supplement it with fixed wireless access around the rest of the country.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Matt, a quick one for you. Any changes to the 2023 CapEx guidance you gave out for that significant drop from this year? And then more broadly, back in March, you talked about a clear path to 4% plus revenue growth in 2024 and beyond. Could you maybe update us on how that looks, how the kind of things like mobile edge compute, B2B applications are scaling and what you can do to get there and give us more visibility around that?\nHans Vestberg: Yes. I can start on the enterprise side with the mobile edge compute, which we \u2013 and the private 5G networks. As I said a couple of times before \u2013 right now, we had three different sort of use cases on the edge computing: one was private networks, another was public mobile edge compute, and the third was the private 5G mobile edge compute. We see clearly a very strong demand on the private 5G networks, which is the prelude to go into all others, and the funnel is strong. And we talked about a couple of examples this quarter which we have gained. And it\u2019s a normal typical enterprise or B2B cycle, where you start with one proof of concept, then you start deploying it, and then you roll it out. So that\u2019s going to continue to happen over the years is, of course, not going to be any significant revenues in the short-term. But over time, we\u2019re building a totally new opportunity for Sapa and his team to be with customers in larger sort of turnkey projects to reform and transform their digital asset for enterprises. So we are still really confident this is a good strategy for us. And it\u2019s \u2013 again, we\u2019re building on the same network. We built a network once, and we have several different use cases where the mobility and now the fixed wireless access both are going in a high speed. And now we\u2019re adding the mobile edge compute that\u2019s starting to get off to a good start, especially with private 5G networks, and then we move into mobile edge compute. So that\u2019s how I see that market continue for us.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Simon, so your first question around CapEx, obviously, we will be more specific on \u201823 guidance in January, but nothing has changed around our view of CapEx. So very much in line and that\u2019s because of the great work the team has done this year. I mean we said we\u2019d be at 175 million POPs covered by the end of the year. As you heard Hans say earlier, already at more than 160 million through 3Q. Not only will we be ahead of the 175 million, but we will be at 200 million at some point during the first quarter, so phenomenal speed that the team has built the network there. That means a significant chunk of the $10 billion CapEx for C-band will have been covered between last year and this year. So it will just be a small stub piece of that left next year and then we will be at those BAU levels that we\u2019ve spoken to all of you about numerous times. In terms of the longer term revenue growth, I mean, obviously, we will come back to that, but certainly encouraged by what we saw in the third quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, wireless service revenue growth when you \u2013 obviously, the year-over-year 10% number has the noise in there from closing on the TracFone acquisition November last year. But I mentioned, even if you ignore all of the Trac revenues, up more than 3% year-over-year. So we\u2019re building the right momentum there. Obviously, we will have significantly more customers on FWA that we will be billing next year than we did this year. Hans mentioned the positive momentum around 5G private networks and MEC. So we will get \u201823 plan locked down here, and then we will be in a position to talk about longer-term where we see things as well, but certainly continuing to build on the momentum that we\u2019ve seen in the last quarter.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. First, a follow-up, please, on John\u2019s question. You\u2019re still losing accounts in Consumer despite pushing pretty hard this quarter. What did you see an impact from the introduction Unlimited plan? And how did that contribute to your gross adds improvement this quarter? And then second, can you give us any idea of what\u2019s going on in Business? You\u2019re seeing really strong adds. AT&T as well and T-Mobile is saying the same thing. Is this second lines being bought by businesses for their employees? What type of usage do you see in those lines? Just give us an idea of what\u2019s going on in the industry? Thanks very much.\nHans Vestberg: I can start on the Business side. We have seen strong business growth on the wireless side for five consecutive quarters. So clearly, what we see is that both from the government, from large enterprises, small and medium businesses, they rely on the \u2013 on high-performing networks is extremely important, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re giving them. And that\u2019s why we are growing. I mean we have had a really good run on it, and the team is doing a great job. I mean this quarter was 197,000 net \u2013 phone net adds in the Business segment. And as Matt said, it\u2019s across over all the three segments: government, enterprise and small and medium businesses. So clearly, we have a good transformation there with our customers. And of course, adding to that, we have a great sales force out there every day with all these accounts because it\u2019s about the network, and it\u2019s about the go to market. And we are the strongest in both, so we feel really good about that.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. And just building on that maybe a little bit...\nPhil Cusick: I\u2019m sorry, Hans, if I can just...\nMatt Ellis: Go ahead. Go ahead, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: I just wanted to follow up on Hans, the question was more what are people using this for, right? So industry penetration is very high. Everybody is looking at around trying to figure out where we\u2019re going. Are these \u2013 do you think these are second lines being bought for maybe sort of high security measures? What\u2019s the usage look on the growing lines in Business versus maybe the new lines in Consumer? We\u2019re just trying to get an idea of what\u2019s driving this strength. And it\u2019s not just you, it\u2019s across the board.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. No, it\u2019s the same \u2013 it\u2019s normal. We see more, of course, as any company will go in more mobile. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re seeing secondary lines or something like that. And remember, we \u2013 if it\u2019s sort of an IoT line, etcetera, that\u2019s outside this. We\u2019re talking about phone net adds here. So this is normal lines that is coming into our customers for normal usage. We haven\u2019t seen any difference in that compared to previous quarter that is something strange there. No, it\u2019s actually normal lines coming in that customers are transforming more to mobility.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. And Phil, just maybe building on that a little bit. Certainly, the continued strong employment position feeds into this. That\u2019s very much the positive. But look, I think the other thing as you think about Business to think about is the depth of the relationships we have with Business customers over many years from both wireless and our legacy wireline relationships and the quality of the network continues to matter to our Business customers and our team have been very effective at selling into those customers. But if you are \u2013 if the suggestion from anything that you have been hearing is these are secondary lines with low usage on it, that couldn\u2019t be more further from the truth. These are absolutely primary lines. We see it in the usage. Certainly, as businesses continue more and more people in mobile, and we see that. But these are absolutely primary use lines, and we know that from the usage we see on that. In terms of on the consumer side, on accounts, certainly, that trend is something that continued into 3Q. And \u2013 but you also saw the positive momentum from a gross add standpoint, and that feeds through into the account trend also moving in a better line than it was. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect 4Q to have positive phone net adds and that should show up in the trend on the accounts side as well. So, look, overall gross adds are up 5%, and they were up on a year-over-year base in consumer. So, there is a lot of good things going on. And then within our base, we just have to keep reminding people of the value. The team is doing an outstanding job there, and they have got more to bring to the market here as we go forward.\nPhil Cusick: Any idea of what the contribution from Welcome Unlimited was Matt? Thank you.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. It\u2019s mix. You have got to think about the contribution from Welcome in two ways. One, obviously, in terms of the number of adds that people signed up for, but more importantly, the number of additional visits to the stores that it drove. Because certainly, some people who came in to Welcome, but it also gave us the opportunity to talk to more customers coming into the stores about all of our plans. So, we would have a good number of customers that came in because they seem to Welcome pricing, but then actually purchased one of our Mix & Match price plans as well. So, we don\u2019t really have a specific breakout there for you, but definitely a contributor to the increase in store traffic and the increase in gross adds.\nPhil Cusick: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Phil. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open sir.\nDavid Barden: Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess two, if I could. I would like to ask a corollary to Phil\u2019s question there, which is \u2013 obviously, we had like negative 11% gross adds last quarter, positive 1% in consumer this quarter. Where are those gross adds coming from? I think you highlighted that you felt there was a hole in the portfolio with respect to BYOD. I would suggest that the BYOD concentrated players, maybe the cable players, are maybe ones that are giving you market share or maybe you have seen something else in the porting ratios that have changed the game. I would be interested in where you think this SoGA shift is coming from? And then the second piece, Matt, your exposure on the balance sheet to variable rates, rising rates is not because you have floating rate debt per se but because you took actions in terms of swaps and hedges to create that variable rate exposure. Theoretically, you could buy your way out of that if you felt that was an economic way to go. Arguably, you could maybe take those losses through to your adjusted EPS, and then it could affect your earnings per share trajectory. Is there any part of you that thinks that there is an economic opportunity that might present itself to reverse gear in some of that variable rate exposure? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. A couple of things, what drove the gross adds. I mean first of all, I think as Matt said, the Welcome plan drove \u2013 because that was a segment we were softer in the first quarter and the second quarter, and that\u2019s why we addressed it. And that was probably the quickest turnaround we have done ever to bring out a new plan dedicated and nationwide. And that should be a reflection of how we plan to work. I mean we will be very agile. We will quickly move into segments where we see softness in our consumer base. And I am happy with what I have seen so far. But also the marketing work because if you think about the growth we had both in gross adds, but also, as Matt said, when it comes to store visits, that was up more than double digit in the quarter compared to second quarter. So, all that together work, and that\u2019s what we need to continue to work and see if there are other weaknesses in the consumer portfolio. Remember, now we are going all the way from the premium down to the lowest and most cost-efficient plans on our prepaid. And the work we are doing, we have integrated that in our consumer group right now. And we look into that we are doing the right things for every segment and see that we have the right offerings for our customers. That might be that we are aggressive in certain segments and not in others. And that\u2019s sort of where we come with our size right now, we can do that. And I was happy with seeing what happened in the second quarter \u2013 or in the third quarter with some of the actions we have taken. But we are not finished yet. We need to do more of this. We need to be more surgical. We need to attack the areas where we see weakness. But that was what\u2019s growing the gross adds in the quarter, clearly.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Hi. On the question around interest rates, so we have absolutely had a targeted rate of effective variable to fix, and that served us very well, continues to serve us very well over the course of the economic cycle. And we think that creates value over the course of the cycle for the company, and obviously, shareholders as well. As you mentioned, Dave, obviously, this year has seen significant increase there. And so some of those hedges have obviously moved around in value. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the work the treasury team has done, not just this year, but over many years now to not just manage the overall debt profile, but also the interest rate expense. You see that in the income statement over the past few years, where even as our debt has gone up to pay for the C-Band acquisition and so on, our total interest expense cost has actually remained relatively flat. So, we will continue to manage the balance sheet there. And as you mentioned, if there is opportunities to create incremental value, I think our track record would tell you very strongly that you should expect us to be doing everything taking full advantage of those.\nDavid Barden: Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you and good morning. When you look across the strategic products, postpaid phones for consumer and business and Fios broadband, what\u2019s the risk that customers trade-down in rate plan tiers if the U.S. goes into recession? And then pivoting over to the value segment, has Verizon begun to migrate any prepaid customers to the postpaid base? And can you size the future opportunity and timing for this possible migration? And then just one more, if I could, on prepaid. Is there an update on the size and timing of savings, especially for roaming when you think about the TracFone integration?\nHans Vestberg: Okay. Let me start with the first one. As we said earlier, man, the Welcome plan worked very well for us, and we didn\u2019t see many of our customers trading down. And actually, it was more about softness in the marketplace there, and that\u2019s where we actually gained success. And then \u2013 but on the other hand, we saw many of our customers coming into the store. And then we \u2013 after a conversation, of course, we saw them actually doing a step-up and then going for another plan. So, it actually worked. We didn\u2019t see that step-downs we see in the market has happened so far, where I think we are segmenting it up with the values we have in each and every segment. So \u2013 but if they would do it over time, given the economic situation, we will be better prepared than anybody else. And when we are actually addressing all the segments of the market, so we can work with that. When it comes to the prepaid \u2013 to the postpaid migration, that is, of course, one of the pillars in our strategy to see that our customers can do that and part of our acquisition strategy to see that we can offer the customers. That will take some IT work. And as I said before, that will technically, meaning that you cannot eat more easily work in between prepaid and postpaid. That will take some time before it\u2019s finished. But already today, of course, we have a collaboration in between our groups as this sort of under one roof, the whole value and premium segments. So, I think that\u2019s what we are going to do. But that\u2019s, of course, an opportunity for us over time to have more of that. But already right now, we are seeing good sign on our value segment as we start growing in the third quarter. And we just added new products, including Total Wireless, which is a higher end of the value market as well as adding now fixed wireless access to the \u2013 to some of the brands. So, there is much more to do. And we are encouraged what we have seen so far about the potential, and that was the reason we acquired TracFone, because we saw this potential to play in all the Consumer segment and adding products in different ways and scaling sort of our platforms. The more we can scale the platforms, the network and the products, the more efficient we are going to be on the return on capital invested.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. A couple of follow-ups there, Mike. So, the risk of trading down, we have obviously seen a number of different economic cycles during the life of the wireless business. And we don\u2019t historically see significant amounts of trade-down during a macro downturn. So, I don\u2019t expect anything different, again, because the value that people place on their connectivity products, whether that\u2019s broadband or wireless, is higher than ever. So, we will obviously monitor it closely, but history would suggest the risk of that is not that high. And then your last question around integration on roaming, we should largely have the roaming integration, all of the customers, over onto the Verizon network during 2023. We haven\u2019t quantified the benefit there, but obviously significant. But that will be \u2013 that should be in the financials by the end of next year.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks very much.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Mike. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open sir.\nTim Horan: Thank you. So, C-Band build-outs going faster and it sounds like better than expected. So, Matt, can you talk about when you think you will largely be done with that spending and maybe just the ultimate \u2013 thinking on the ultimate POPs covered and capacity that you are adding? Any color there would be great?\nHans Vestberg: Yes. I can start and Matt will come in there as well. But when it comes to the C-Band spending, you remember, we said we are going to do an additional $10 billion on CapEx. The year has not ended, but you have seen more or less where we are guiding. So, it\u2019s going to be some portion left for the next year on CapEx, but that\u2019s a smaller part. And then it\u2019s going to be BAU because then we have done all our initial. What has happened after that is, of course, we are getting a much more spectrum to the sites and we get some more markets. But then we are down to BAU as we have always been building capacity and network on 4G, 3G. Now, we will do it on 5G with the spectrum we have. So, feel good about that situation and how we have been doing it. And this was part of the strategy we laid out for the network already 2017 in order to draw the benefit of a unified network with a strong sort of edge capability with different type of access technologies. And now, of course, with C-Band, we are adding that strength. So, we are going to pass the 200 million POPs in the first quarter 2023, and then we will just continue to deploy as we are getting more spectrum. I mean still today, we are using mainly 60 megahertz. There are some places where we have started to trial out 100 megahertz. But as you know, we have 161 megahertz nationwide. And in some places, we are 200 megahertz. So, we have so much more spectrum and capacity. But the guys have been building smart. So, when the spectrum comes, we turn it up. It\u2019s not going out to the site again. So, we are ready for that.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So, Tim, just on the \u2013 exactly what Hans said on the timing. If you think about it, we are still spending on the LTE network today, and that\u2019s obviously 10-plus years from when we launched. So, that\u2019s because the usage on the network continues to grow, the utility people get from it continues to grow. And that\u2019s why you see our customer base expanding as a result. But as you think about connecting the dots here, as we said, we will be close to 200 million \u2013 well, we will cross 200 million POPs in the first quarter of next year. The $10 billion will largely be spent \u2013 we said there would be a stub left over to next year, so that kind of overlaps there. So, think about it from the standpoint, the $10 billion took care of covering the first roughly 200 million POPs. Then the rest of it goes into BAU. And you create space in BAU because those 200 million POPs have now got C-Band coverage. We said over half of our base has a 5G compatible device in their hands. And so the usage growth in those areas is going on C-Band. That means we don\u2019t have to continue spending on LTE in those markets. And then combined with other programs that are coming to an end on the peak spend, such as OneFiber, Intelligent Edge Network, that\u2019s the space for the C-Band continued build, both from a coverage and a capacity standpoint, to be in the BAU-level spend, just like as we continue to expand the LTE network for many years. It was part of the BAU-level spend. So, absolutely peak level this year. CapEx comes down next year. And then I would expect even further in \u201824 as the $10 billion is completely gone, as we spoke about earlier this year. And that obviously has a positive impact on free cash flow and the decisions we will be able to have in front of us as a result of that going forward. So, couldn\u2019t be happier with the pace at which the team has built it out and spent that money, unbelievable work the team has done there. And it puts us in a great place to reduce CapEx going forward.\nTim Horan: So, any updates on the ultimate amount of coverage that you will have or POPs covered and rough timing on that?\nMatt Ellis: I think Kyle has said pretty clearly that you should expect \u2013 where you get 4G today, you should be expecting to get 5G in the future as we continue to build out.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Our C-Band spectrum is nationwide, every market, every state. So, we are just going to complete that and see that we have a similar as the 4G network, as Matt says.\nTim Horan: Good. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Tim. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Hans, I wonder if you could talk about convergence a little bit, particularly on the consumer side of your business. There is certainly a broad sense that the industry is moving towards converged offerings of wireless and home Internet. How do you think about that? And how do you think about it differently in areas where you have Fios and where you have fixed wireless broadband? Is that, in some ways, what\u2019s driving the fixed wireless broadband deployment, or do you see them as still somewhat two separate services that are trying to fill two separate needs?\nHans Vestberg: Hey Craig. I think first of all, we have seen some early steps of convergence in a market where mobility and home is going together. Of course, ultimately, the customers will define is that the best model. I think we are in a great position for obvious reasons, where we deploy our fixed \u2013 remember, when we deploy our network on the C-Band, we start in urban and suburban. And that\u2019s of course, also where the fixed wireless access opportunity arises. So, then the combination of fixed and home and mobile is emerging there. So, we are going to play on that. And you have seen we have offerings on that in the market and also working with our Fios footprint equally much. We have the optionality. And the customers will decide if that is a good way forward. I think we are in a very strong position. We have owners\u2019 economics on all our home broadband and all our mobility and being able to see that we can follow the market. And it goes back a little bit to what I have said before. We need to be agile and be surgical in different segments. If we see that, for example, convergence is happening in certain segments, we quickly come out with offerings and do that. And that\u2019s what the team is working with constantly right now. And if that is a trend going there and it\u2019s just accentuated, we are going to be super well positioned for that. If it\u2019s not, we are also super positioned for keeping it separate. We are going to see that the market. We are going to drive the market. We think it\u2019s strength for us that we have owners\u2019 economics on both mobility and broadband. So, we will drive it where we see a good traction on it. And as you have seen already, we have already offerings out there, and we will continue to do so.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks Craig. Operator or Brad, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. What are the largest factors impacting your churn in your base right now? And kind of after we get through this bump from the pricing action, what do you need to address to get the churn back down? And how soon can we see those tactics begin to work?\nHans Vestberg: I think when it comes to the consumer churn, as Matt explained, the vast majority in the third quarter was coming from the price adjustments we did, which was a deliberate decision we took in the second quarter, and it was as expected. That was the larger piece of it in the churn. And as Matt said before, our job right now is to continue to drive this downwards and see that, that is evaporating out there. We have some leakage into the \u2013 into October from it because \u2013 given how the price adjustments come out in the market.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Just, Frank, to build on that a little bit. So, absolutely, we expected to see that increase, but it was certainly a good a good trade for us because it drove the gross add increase that we spoke about earlier, also drove a 2% sequential increase in service revenue and 3% in EBITDA. So, we will work through the bubble from that as we go forward. But obviously, the actions produce the type of results that we wanted. We will expect to get back to more normal levels going forward. We constantly have to communicate to our base of customers the value of being on the Verizon network, and that\u2019s something that we have got many years of doing. As we have just spoke about a couple of questions ago, the quality of that network with the C-Band build-out is expanding rapidly. And we have the opportunity to continue to demonstrate to customers the premium service they get on Verizon. And as we do that, I am very confident that churn will get back to the levels we would expect it to be. And combined with the improved gross add performance, we will see that show up in the financials, and more importantly, in strong cash flow from the business. So, really happy with the sequential trajectory we have. We need to keep building on that as we go forward here. That\u2019s what the team is focused on.\nFrank Louthan: Alright. Great. Thank you very much.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thanks Frank. Brad, that\u2019s all the time we have today.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-22 13:30:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Brad. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor. And I am here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now, let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we reported earnings of $1.24 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported second quarter earnings include a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $435 million, including a net pre-tax charge of approximately $198 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment for our pension liabilities. In addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $237 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.31 in the second quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the second quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter was not a good barometer for where Verizon has been or where it\u2019s going. While we are not satisfied with our performance, we know what the issues are. And we are already executing to reaccelerate in the second half of the year. As I said in our first quarter earnings call and reiterated since, we are seeing weaker consumer wireless volumes. The inflationary environment is clearly impacting consumer behavior. And we also saw intensified competition for consumer attention. The result was a significant impact on our gross adds. Based on our performance this quarter and [Indiscernible] of the landscape, we are updating our financial guidance by lowering our expectation for service and other revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Matt will provide more detail in a few minutes. As you know, we have already responded. Last week, we launched our Welcome Unlimited plan for consumer wireless that will meet the needs of budget-conscious consumers without providing device subsidies. In addition to these new plans, we took pricing actions in both of our business units to mitigate inflationary pressures. In consumer, we also adjusted prices for some legacy metered plans, increasing revenue per plan while motivating step-ups to our Unlimited offerings. All of these actions position us for improved performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023. More than ever, our leadership team is focused on executing our strategy through operational and customer-focused solutions. While I am confident that we have the right strategy in place, we will continue to refine our approach as the consumer market evolves. Looking further into our business, we continue to see momentum that gives us confidence in our ability to improve performance over the long-term. In our Consumer Group, we have consistently pursued a disciplined strategy of offering high-quality services at the competitive prices. We know the economic pressures that our customers are facing and are carefully bringing new offers to meet their needs. I am personally working with the Consumer Group to define our disciplined approach to the market, while also looking closely at how we operate and do business. This is reflected in the plans and promotions we introduced in May, June and July. Mix & Match continues to drive premium plan adoption, with 78% of our consumer base on unlimited plans and 39% on premium unlimited. We have seen healthy step-ups for five consecutive quarters, which continues to drive ARPA growth. And there is room for more. While consumer budgets are becoming strained, we continue to find ways of delivering new valuable services while recognizing that the handset subsidies we are seeing in our industry are not sustainable long-term. Our new Welcome Unlimited plan is a great example of this. We have tailored offers for the full range of Consumer segment from premium to value across postpaid and prepaid to meet all consumer needs in this challenging market condition. In the prepaid value segment, our integration of TracFone is on schedule and provides us with another suite of offerings to bring consumers onto our network. Our fixed wireless access solution continues to bring us new connections. Across consumer and business, we increased fixed wireless net adds by 32% over the first quarter, driven by a 50% increase from our Consumer Group. In our Business Group, we again delivered excellent wireless volumes, with 430,000 net adds, including 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. This marks our third consecutive quarter exceeding 200,000 wireless phone net adds. In the Global Enterprise market, businesses, government agencies and other institutions continue to recognize the power of Verizon\u2019s network and the importance of digitalization. This week, we announced an over $400 million project with FBI to help the Bureau meet its global bandwidth demands, we will provide direct access to our development team and will advise our system enhancements like cloud computing, video and imaging transmission and data applications. We also offer private 5G solutions to optimize complex organizations. We recently partnered with the Virginia International Terminals to build a private 5G network across its Seaports campus. This network is scalable to replace WiFi with more secure connectivity. We are seeing new opportunities and increased demand for these network solutions from enterprises and other organizations. Verizon is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the moment and provide the highest quality private networks to these customers. Private networks are the gateway to mobile edge compute, which can deliver game-changing customer outcomes, including revenue growth, new customer experience and cost savings. During the second quarter, we expanded our MEC ecosystem by bringing AWS Wavelength zones to Nashville and Tampa and now reached 19 metro areas. This means that 75% of the U.S. population is now within 150 miles of Verizon\u2019s 5G Edge. In partnership with Truist, we supported the launch of the 10,000 square foot innovation technology center in Charlotte, North Carolina. As a founding member of the innovators in residence program, we will help create a global hub for the development of 5G and MEC application in the Financial Service segment. This trend will continue to create growth opportunity for us across a range of industries as we are market leader in 5G private networks and in mobile edge compute. The momentum in Verizon Business is a fitting send-off for Group CEO, Tami Erwin, who is ending her amazing 35-year career at Verizon. We promoted Sampath as the Verizon\u2019s Business CEO on July 1. Sampath brings over two decades of experience in digital networks, critical infrastructure protection and a deep understanding on how networks play a role in enterprise growth and global security. He has been part of the Verizon team for more than 8 years. And I know that he is the right leader to take Verizon Business forward. The power of our network gives us the flexibility to meet the needs of our customers across consumer and business. The continued and speedy expansion of our network and capabilities creates agility and optionality within our larger strategy. We ended the quarter with 135 million POPs covered by C-Band and remain on track to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of the year. With the early clearance that we announced in March, we are expanding service into an additional 30 markets and have started deploying 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in many markets across the U.S., almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G. We are seeing the phenomenal performance we expected. Network usage is growing quickly, with C-Band usage up 233% since the end of the first quarter and millimeter wave traffic up 49% year-to-date. Where C-Band is deployed, it accounts for more than a third of our wireless traffic on average. Consumers are also equipped with the devices they need to use 5G. Currently, 47% of our consumer base has a 5G phone and we expect that number to reach nearly 60% by year end. Our already-best wireless network continues to earn recognition for its performance and dependability. This month, J.D. Power gave us the highest number of awards for network quality for the 29th time in a row. And RootMetrics recognized us for having the best overall network performance in the country for the 18th time in 9 years. Turning to the second half of the year, we will continue to listen to our customers and give them reason to sign up, stay and upgrade with us. This month, we also added, on top of our yearly business transformation, a multiyear program to enhance our efficiency measures and actuate the cost benefits delivered. This will ensure that our balance sheet remains strong for the market ahead. We are on the horizon with the goal of growing our business and controlling costs. We will never shy away from investing a portion of our cost savings in our growth initiatives. We are confident in our ability to deliver both efficiency and growth, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Before I turn it over to Matt to give you more details on our results and our outlook for the second half of the year, I want to mention that we reached a tentative deal with our unions to extend our collective bargaining agreement. This extension will provide us with labor stability focused on our customers and opportunities to grow our business over the next 4 years. By that, I hand it over to Matt.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans and good morning everyone. As Hans said, this was a challenging quarter and our results did not meet the expectations we have set for ourselves. We have implemented multiple actions to better position Verizon for the future. At the same time, we expect the market environment to continue to be very competitive for the remainder of 2022. Before discussing our expectations for the remainder of the year, let\u2019s walk through results from the second quarter, beginning with an overview of our postpaid mobility results on Slide 7. Our runway for mobility growth is predicated on driving our customer base into higher value data plans and we continue to make good progress in the second quarter. Premium penetration within our consumer base increased to 39% at quarter end and 57% of new accounts in the quarter selected Premium Unlimited and step-ups within our existing base remained healthy. This activity helped drive a 2.4% year-over-year increase in consumer postpaid ARPA. Our recent administrative fee increase and economic adjustment charge began to show up on customers\u2019 bills in the last few days of the second quarter and we expect close to a full quarter\u2019s benefit to revenue and ARPA trends in the third quarter, while our metered price changes will be phased in throughout the third quarter, which will provide an additional uplift. We reported postpaid phone net adds of 12,000 in the second quarter as strong business results more than offset softer consumer performance. Business delivered 227,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand across all lines of the business group, as phone gross adds were up nearly 30% from the same period a year ago and we expect this strong performance to continue. On the consumer side, postpaid phone net losses were 215,000 in the quarter and stemmed from two main drivers. First, churn increased by 10 basis points compared to the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn contributed roughly half of the increase due to the expiration of state consumer protection policies and less stimulus funding. This was coupled with an 11% decline in phone gross adds from the prior year, driven by the competitive offerings in the marketplace. As Hans indicated, we recently introduced a Welcome plan in order to drive demand for more price-conscious consumers, particularly as they make spending adjustments due to the effects of higher inflation. This new plan is well positioned to attract new customers, especially for those who bring their own device. It is our most basic Unlimited offering with no device promotions or many of the other features available in Mix & Match Unlimited to plans. We reserve our most generous acquisition and retention offers for consumers willing to select our Premium Unlimited plans and we believe that opportunities exist to better serve these high-value customers. Upgrade activity remained elevated throughout the quarter, reflecting loyalty within our core customer base, while also serving to drive greater premium adoption. As a result, total postpaid phone activations across consumer and business were up 8% from the same period last year. Let\u2019s now discuss broadband performance on Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to scale and grow our nationwide broadband opportunity with additional expansion of fixed wireless households and businesses covered. In addition, we expanded Fios availability to add additional 150,000 homes during the quarter and are on track to achieve our target of 550,000 incremental homes open for sale in 2022. Total broadband net adds were 268,000 in the quarter, an increase of 39,000 sequentially in what is traditionally a seasonally softer quarter. Fixed wireless momentum accelerated as we added 256,000 subscribers in the quarter, up from 194,000 in 1Q. Fixed wireless net adds have increased every month throughout 2022 and we expect to continue that trend in the third quarter. We also added 36,000 Fios Internet net adds during the second quarter. While Fios Internet churn remains well below pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing softer gross adds due to lower-than-expected switching activity from moves and fewer new home purchases. We recently introduced Fios Mix & Match 3.0 that aligns our Fios and fixed wireless pricing and better positions us to grow joint account penetration. Now, let\u2019s talk about the value market on Slide 9. Our integration of TracFone is on track and the team remains focused on enhancing the customer value proposition and delivering cost synergies through migrating off-net customers onto the Verizon network. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of 227,000 in the second quarter and total Verizon prepaid net losses were 229,000. These results exclude a base adjustment of 402,000 related to a competitor\u2019s 3G shutdown. Our prepaid volumes were impacted by aggressive postpaid promotions. As we made progress on our TracFone integration initiatives, we will be better positioned to serve those customers wanting to migrate to postpaid offerings. Our business case had anticipated subscriber losses during the early phase of the integration period, which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. However, should customer preferences shift to the value market and make recessionary concerns we would expect to see some benefits. Prepaid ARPU was $31.26 in the quarter, up modestly on a sequential basis and we expect it to remain stable going forward. Now, let\u2019s move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 10. On a consolidated basis, total revenue was relatively flat year-over-year, as wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue were offset primarily by wireline declines and the net impact of last year\u2019s M&A activity. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.1%, primarily driven by our ownership of TracFone, further progress on our Premium Unlimited strategy and strong business volumes. Service and other revenue was down 3.9% for the quarter as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 billion for the quarter, down 2.6% year-over-year due to the divestiture of Verizon Media, higher device subsidies and promotional spending associated with the increased wireless activations, wireline revenue declines and inflationary cost pressures. Regarding inflation, we are seeing the pressures within our cost structure, most notably on labor costs, utilities and transportation and logistics expenses. We expect these pressures to accelerate in the second half of the year and have an impact on profitability and earnings. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $1.31, down 5.8% from the prior year. This primarily reflects the impact of our adjusted EBITDA results and higher D&A related to our C-Band rollout. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our second quarter consumer financial results. Total consumer revenue for the quarter grew 9.1% year-over-year, driven by the inclusion of TracFone, higher equipment revenue, and core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 10.5% year-over-year, also driven by the inclusion of TracFone and postpaid ARPU growth. Total Fios revenue was flat versus the same period a year ago, as internet growth was offset by video and voice declines. Consumer EBITDA was $10.4 billion, down 0.3% compared to the same period last year. Our higher contribution from TracFone was more than offset primarily by higher promotional activity. Consumer EBITDA margin was 40.5% in the quarter. Now, let\u2019s take a close look at the business financial results on Slide 12. The Business segment\u2019s wireless results remained strong in 2Q, while wireline service declines continued amid a softening economy and ongoing secular headwinds. Wireless service revenue growth of 3.0% was up from 2.1% last quarter. Small and medium business continued its strong momentum, accelerating growth for the second consecutive quarter, while Global Enterprise had its best performance since the first quarter of 2020. Business wireline declines were elevated this quarter, in part due to foreign currency and federal USF, which together impacted growth by more than 300 basis points year-over-year. The secular process from technology migration continued to weigh on legacy voice and data services. And we expect this trend to continue. Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year. In addition to wireline revenue declines, we experienced elevated device subsidies related to the 15% year-over-year increase in wireless activations in the quarter. EBITDA margin was 22.9% in the second quarter. Moving on to Slide 13 on the cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2022 totaled $17.7 billion compared with $20.4 billion in the prior year period. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts from higher device activations and increased inventory levels as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.5 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $2.8 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $7.2 billion for the first half of the year. We exited the quarter with $130.6 billion of net unsecured debt, a sequential improvement of $5 billion, resulting in a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. In a period of rising interest rates, our balance sheet is in a strong position, with less than $2 billion of unsecured bonds maturing in the next 18 months. Lastly, let\u2019s move to an update on guidance for the remainder of the year. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. We now expect wireless service revenue growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%, down from the prior 9% to 10% range. The pricing actions already implemented are expected to contribute approximately $1 billion in the second half of 2022. However, this benefit is expected to be offset by the accounting impact of promotional activity and the impact of lower net adds. As a result of the reduction in wireless service revenue expectations and anticipated ongoing wireline pressures, we now expect service and other revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to flat. We are lowering our adjusted EBITDA growth expectations for the full year to a range of minus 1.5% to flat versus our prior range of 2% to 3%. This revised outlook accounts for higher levels of activations driven by our promotional activity, inflation-driven costs that we discussed previously, the reduction in wireless service revenue and business wireline revenue headwinds. Our guidance assumes Consumer EBITDA margin in 3Q to be similar to margins seen in the first half, with typical seasonality in 4Q. Business EBITDA margins in the second half of 2022 are expected to be in line with those reported in the first half of the year. Finally, we are lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.10 to $5.25 versus the prior $5.40 to $5.55 range. This fee reflects the reduction in adjusted EBITDA as well as incremental cash interest expense versus our expectations at the beginning of the year of about $300 million for the full year compared with the $150 million to $200 million we estimated last quarter, due to updated market expectations for additional Fed fund rate increases. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business-as-usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion of C-Band-related spending. In closing, we are confident in our strategy and believe that our assets position us well to generate long-term shareholder value. I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments before we open up to questions. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. In summary, we view this quarter and second half challenges as short-term. We have a strong and resilient business model that is well suited to deliver favorable financial results, even in uncertain economic times. In this environment, we remain disciplined and focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through improved revenue and profitability, with healthy cash generation that supports our network investments and dividend policy as well as a strong balance sheet. We also have the best team in the industry, and I know they are ready to deliver. The actions we have taken in our Consumer business creates an opportunity to solidify consumer performance. Those actions include new postpaid plans and our continued integration of TracFone. Fixed wireless access for both Consumer and Business has proven to be a powerful connectivity solution. We expect our nationwide broadband presence and our fixed wireless subscriber base to grow well into the future. We continue to drive business wireless subscription and expand our MEC ecosystem. Taken together, and combined with our accelerated efficiency work, our actions during the quarter address our competitive challenges. And we will continue to listen to our customers and thoughtfully respond in the marketplace. Our second quarter initiatives are designed to strengthen our Network-as-a-Service capacity, which uses the power of our network to drive results from our five vectors of growth. Thank you for all, and we\u2019re ready to take your questions. Brady, back to you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we\u2019re ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And two questions, if you don\u2019t mind. Yesterday, AT&T cited that they were seeing a delay in the collections of payments, specifically from their consumer customer base. So I was curious, have you seen any stretching out of DSOs or bad debt expense? And really what\u2019s embedded in your outlook, especially if you\u2019re anticipating that the macro remains a bit tougher? And then the second question is, you outlined some of the steps you\u2019ve taken from a price plan standpoint to sort of better position your Consumer Wireless business. Is there anything else you think you need to do at this point or is it mostly execution-driven? And all in, do you think the steps you have taken so far are sufficient to get back to positive Consumer postpaid phone net adds in the third quarter or at some point in the second half of the year? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. I can start with the second part of it. As you said, I mean, we have taken several actions in the quarter, aggressive all the way from the new Unlimited plan with bring your own device and no subsidy. And then, of course, we also have done our increases on the pricing actions we have taken. So we\u2019ve taken that. But we constantly now evaluate if we need to do something more. But we will be very conscious about discipline in the market, because I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s sustainable long-term to continue with the subsidized model. So we will policy in and then policy out. Of course, it\u2019s a holiday season, of course, that will be there. So we will work with that one. But clearly that will do. But remember also, if you look at our value \u2013 our Premium segment, this is, in the high end, we\u2019re doing really well. We have high quality [Indiscernible] customers. You see the step-ups continuing. So what we are addressing right now is the metered and low-end Unlimited, which are more price conscious right now. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re addressing with it. So we are more surgical than just making any blanket decisions here. So that\u2019s very good. And on top of that, we feel good about TracFone. Of course, if the market would turn even worse, I mean we have TracFone. And then we can play in all segments and meet all the demand from different customers. But clearly, we\u2019re staying extremely close with Matt. And I and Manon and her team, we work weekly to see where the market is going, if we need to adjust. But we will always think about how we \u2013 our financial discipline and how we preserve cash. Because we always need to think two times before we bring in customers. We want high-quality customers. Matt, maybe you can comment on the customer base.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks, Hans. And thanks for the question, Brett. So and actually building on your last comment there, Hans, about high-quality customers, Brett, that shows up in the payment patterns we\u2019re seeing. We haven\u2019t seen any noticeable change in the payment patterns from customers, continues to be very good, very much in line with what we were seeing pre-COVID, in fact, slightly better than that time period. And when you look at the quality of the business we\u2019re writing, the FICO scores in our DPP portfolio have never been higher. So at this point in time, we\u2019re continuing to see the type of strong payment patterns that you would expect from the high-quality customer base that we have.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Great. Thanks, Brett. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you. Good morning. You noted a few times some of the pricing actions that you\u2019ve recently taken, both the price increases but also the recent Unlimited welcome offer at $30. Could you give us a little bit of early reads in the marketplace, your ability for customers to digest these price increases, maybe move to other plans as well as any incremental traffic that you\u2019re seeing from the new Unlimited plans? And are those customers taking that offer? Or is this really driving door swings to maybe trade up to one of the higher offers as well? And then secondly, last quarter, you did talk about store traffic deteriorating in the latter part of the quarter around the war, etcetera. Be great to get a sense of how store traffic trended through 2Q and into Q3. Is it pretty consistent with those levels you saw? Has it deteriorated further? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: On the prices, let me start and Matt will add in there. Of course, the pricing actions we took with price increases and on the metered plan and adjustments, that, we will see coming into play in the second half of this year. So that \u2013 we will, of course, expect some of it. There might be some consumers that are cost conscious that will do disconnects and that we\u2019re calculating with. On the Welcome Unlimited, which is a segmentation of the Unlimited market, it\u2019s a little bit too early to say. It\u2019s only been in the market for, I think, 7 or 8 days. So it\u2019s a little bit early to say. We think we\u2019re addressing the markets \u2013 a part of the market where we had some outflows in the second quarter. And we have taken that action aggressively with this plan. But clearly, we also see opportunities for having step-ups in that plan as well from our customers. Matt, anything more?\nMatt Ellis: No, just one thing I\u2019d add to Hans\u2019 response, Simon. Certainly, we expect to see significant benefit in the second half of the year from the actions we\u2019ve taken. I mentioned that in my comments. That\u2019s probably about $1 billion of incremental revenue sequentially in the second half versus the first half. I would expect, and we have assumed in our forward view, that we will see a small bubble in churn here in the third quarter as a result of customers as they get those price increases on metered plans or whatever else. But apart from that, we expect to see significant benefit from the actions we\u2019ve taken.\nHans Vestberg: And maybe \u2013 sorry, I didn\u2019t answer on the store traffic there, I realized that. So as we said in the first quarter and through the second quarter, we had a little bit less of traffic in our stores in April and May and the latter part of March. We saw some pickup in June, but still a little bit below earlier trends. But that might be just the market and how it\u2019s working right now. But other than that, nothing special.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. First as follow-up, if I can. And I don\u2019t mean this to sound disrespectful. But on one hand, you\u2019re raising prices with fees. On the other hand, you\u2019re bringing in lower-priced discounted offers. And I know you\u2019re offering loyalty credits to customers who call and complain about pricing. And it seems like you\u2019re out of the market. So do you think that your network is going to return to its dominance, and you can sort of get through this period? Or do you think you need to really readdress your competitive position in order to maintain share? I\u2019m sorry to return to something you\u2019ve talked about a few times already, but I\u2019m really having a hard time with it. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Phil. First of all, we feel really good about our network and the quality of the network. It\u2019s actually better than ever and as you hear us talking as well. We are just in the midst of the C-Band rollout, which is extremely strong and the performance we see on it. And we just are passing over 130 million plus POPs on it, by year-end at least 175 million. So we\u2019re going to have many more customers getting the benefit of the C-Band. So now we feel good about that our revenues. You saw the RootMetrics. You saw the \u2013 both of the J.D. Power as well and having us as the best network. So we don\u2019t feel that is different. What we\u2019re doing right now, I think that\u2019s \u2013 you have to be clear \u2013 very clear, Phil. We are segmenting the market. So where we now have the Welcome plan, that\u2019s a segment of the Unlimited and metered plan. On the high end, we have \u2013 as Matt said, we have really good sort of loyalty. We see step-ups. Exactly as we outlined in our plans, that\u2019s what we [seeing continued] (ph). And that\u2019s why we saw the ARPA increase in this quarter, and we see continuous step-up. So I think, not only think, I\u2019m confident our strategy is working. We\u2019re just addressing a segment in this economical time. So I feel really good about the strategy and how we do it. And we will continue to be very focused on cash flow and getting the right type of customers, because we believe high-quality customers are important. And that means loyalty. It means also a very good base to build on. So we feel good about the strategy. I understand your question, but I feel really good about it. Matt, anything else?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Hans, maybe the only other thing I\u2019d add on is, Phil, one of the things we\u2019ve done during the current quarter, we mentioned last time that we\u2019ve reached an agreement with some of the satellite companies to get early clearing on outside the initial 46 C-Band markets. And in those markets, we\u2019re not turning on 60 megahertz, but 100 megahertz of the C-Band. And the difference in the speeds that we\u2019re seeing with 100 megahertz versus 60 is exactly in line with what we\u2019d expect. But it tells us that we have a path to a very, very strong network performance. We really like what we\u2019re seeing on C-Band today. But when we get the full amount deployed, it\u2019s going to be an uptick even further. So we absolutely believe that a network-driven strategy will allow us to continue to perform very well.\nPhil Cusick: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Phil. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Betsy for John. Can you talk a little bit about how you expect fixed wireless trends to trend from here? Is there an opportunity to expand maybe the addressable market as you build C-Band further? And maybe an update of what percent of that fixed wireless base is new to Verizon. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Hey, great question. No, first of all, we feel really good about our five vectors of growth. And in one of the vectors, of course, we have national broadband. This was exactly what we envisioned when we rolled out the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network in 2017, that we can have multiple opportunities to address the market. And fixed wire actually is just humming for us. I mean, 32% growth, 50% growth in the Consumer Group. This is all about us deploying the network. Of course, we have millimeter wave and we have 4G in the fixed wireless access, but the C-Band both, they gave a coverage and an enormous good performance as well. So as we rollout and hitting more households, we are going to we can grow even faster. So our expectation, Betsy, is of course, we will continue to have that opportunity to grow right now from the base we have as we\u2019re opening most households. But remember, from the opening household to [indiscernible] etcetera, is a little bit time lag because the direct marketing and all of that is working through. But we feel really good about. We feel also good about our Fios, even though it was a little bit less of net adds on Fios because less movements, I guess, in this environment, nothing strange. But really good performance on Fios when it comes to the network and our customer base and your churn. So all in all, the national broadband is playing really good for us. And this was a strategy from the beginning. I have high expectations. Matt has high expectation on as well. Our teams are executing from the network to our commercials. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Hey, Pat, so just maybe one data point for you on fixed wireless. About 30% of our FWA adds, what we would call new, new to Verizon, where we didn\u2019t have an existing relationship with them. So obviously, we like the ability of taking an existing Verizon customer and adding a service. But when you bring a completely new customer on the platform, that\u2019s pretty exciting as well. So hopefully, that helps your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Betsy. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess my first one, Matt, we\u2019ve thrown out a couple of numbers, $1 billion of top line and incremental benefit from pricing plans, maybe $300 million of incremental interest from presumably floating rate debt. Can we talk about some of the other numbers you talked about, we threw out some math around inflation and the impact it could have on the $20 billion of expenses that\u2019s exposed to inflation? Kind of what\u2019s the inflation headwind dollar number that you\u2019re budgeting for? And then when we talked about this equipment and supply chain working capital headwind, what kind of dollar number are we talking about there? And then, Hans, I think you mentioned in passing the CB agreement or agreement in principle that you signed, I think last week. It seems like a potentially dangerous time with the inflation that we have around us right now to be kind of locking into multiyear collective bargaining agreements. Could you talk about why this is happening and why you feel comfortable doing it now? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Dave. So, thank you for the question. So, look, as you think about the guide at the EBITDA level, as you say, there is about $1 billion of revenue sequential uptick. But then the offset to that, you have got the promotional spend that is certainly running at a higher level than we thought at the beginning of the year based off what we are seeing in the marketplace. And we are making the assumption that we are going to see that type of level for the balance of the year that\u2019s based in there of the reduction in EBITDA growth from the 2% to 3% down to the minus 1.5% to flat, 75 basis points to 100 basis points of that is coming from inflation and our assumption of that for the full year versus our original plans for the year. On the working capital side, you have got a couple of things playing in there. One is, over the last couple of years, we have had some artificial working capital headwinds caused by COVID as volumes came down. Transaction volumes came down. That gave us some lower EPP balances that was a favor to working capital. We now, of course, see volumes increasing again. And so you have got that reverting to more normal levels, on top of which, moving to 36-month EPP will increase the amount of outstanding balances versus what we saw pre-COVID. So, we will work through a large chunk of that this year. And I would expect to see less of a working capital headwind half of this year, but that\u2019s certainly in the \u2013 you will see that in the free cash flow right now. We feel very good about the cash flow generation about the business going forward and what we will achieve as we work through this current period. Hans, I will hand it over to you for the union question.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thank you. And maybe a comment on the supply chain because there is a lot of discussion around that. And I have to say that Verizon has done a great job on our supply chain around the whole supply chain and secure that. I mean you can see that in our rollout on our C-Band millimeter wave and everything else we are doing in the network that were way ahead of our earlier plans. And that\u2019s of course, how we have secured our supply chain, I really want to say. When it comes to the unions, I mean we have reached, as I said in my remarks, we have reached a tentative agreement on the union agreement with them. And we have a great partnership with the union. So, we think this is an important one. You have to see that we secured the workloads we have in the future and see that we continue to have a great working relationship with the union. So, that\u2019s why we have this tentative agreement.\nDavid Barden: Great.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. You are discussing the strength of your Business Wireless segment. And your competitors are also talking about stronger business wireless performance. I am just curious if there is something larger afoot within this segment in terms of behavior and the way businesses are buying wireless? Related to that, is that possibly coming out of what was traditionally the consumer market? So, is there some kind of shift that\u2019s also happening underneath the industry in terms of where sales are coming into? And then just one other, I am just thinking about what you talked about in terms of the change in guidance for revenue and EBITDA for this year. And I am curious how this informs the multi-year outlook that the company previously established in the relationship you are seeing longer term between the performance of revenue and profitability.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. On the business wireless, you have seen us now for several quarters having a really good run on it. Our conclusion and our confidence level is high that our mission-critical networks is so important for our customers. And that\u2019s why we see such a good traction on it. I think it\u2019s normally, there are probably some leakage in between consumer to small and medium, but it\u2019s also from small and medium or consumer, the small and medium. So, that I don\u2019t think is anything different than what I have seen before, but it\u2019s always some type of movements in between. So, we feel really good about our business wireless and how they are performing and how our customers like our network. On the second question, as I said also before, I mean we think it\u2019s a short-term challenging times right now. Long-term, we are confident that this is a great market. We have great assets. And we can execute on our plans. So, I am \u2013 whatever we have done in the last 5 years here, with the network, with our divestments and acquisitions, we have positioned ourselves for a really good long-term strategy in a market where mobility, broadband and cloud are the most important digital assets for consumers and businesses. I couldn\u2019t dream to have another position that we have today. So, I am confident about the long-term of our business. Matt, anything else?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Hans, maybe just a couple of things. Mike, if you think back pre-COVID, Verizon Business Group had very strong performance. Obviously, COVID was very disruptive to the Business segment. You have seen the recovery in net adds over the past year now be very strong. And you are seeing that show up in the service revenue growth, up to 3% this quarter, up sequentially two quarters in a row now. And we do expect that to continue at a strong pace. And as Hans said, we are not going to comment on multiyear outlook at this point, but certainly feel like the actions that we are taking and have taken and will continue to work on put us on a path to EBITDA growth as we go forward here. So, look forward to, obviously, updating you on that as we get into next year.\nMichael Rollins: One just quick follow-up, if I could. With going through the pandemic and kind of where we are today, there is a bigger work-from-home and hybrid working environment. Is that emboldening companies to kind of shift from what felt like for years, they were trying to get out of like buying devices and services for their employees. And is that involving them to now, because of this different work environment, actually buy wireless communications on behalf of their employees differently than maybe 2 years or 3 years ago?\nHans Vestberg: Thanks. I think I actually see both. I mean we see \u2013 we saw a trend over the years of bring your own device from enterprises. But actually in order to secure a more seamless experience for enterprise customers, we see more we see more now customers actually going back and actually supplying the devices of our customers. It\u2019s a little bit dependent on what type of business they are into, I have to say. But we see a little bit of a trend going down the direction right now. Think about building private 5G networks, where you want everybody to have a seamless wireless \u2013 5G wireless experience inside an office and then going out on the street and having Verizon\u2019s commercial network. Then you need to deploy a handset that is actually coming from the company in order to manage it. So, we see actually both. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accentuated trend, at least as I can tell from taking the question on this level. On the other thing, I just want to give another data point as well. I mean remember, I talked a lot about handoffs in the networks during COVID was sometimes down 60% in New York City that people didn\u2019t move. We are back to the hands of \u2013 that means handovers. It seems like people are moving equally much right now as we are doing pre-COVID. It\u2019s, of course, a different buckets. But on the high level, when we look at the network, handovers are back to normal and actually even a little bit more. That can of course, depend on that how much more equipment we have deployed in 2 years. But that\u2019s what we see.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Mike. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Hans, I wonder as we think about growth, maybe we revisit some of the comments you have made over the past couple of years about 5G. As the market has evolved, what is your latest thinking about the opportunity, both for the industry and for Verizon specifically as it relates to some of the new revenue opportunities that seem so promising a couple of years back, like mobile edge compute and private networks and that sort of thing? Is there \u2013 is it right that, I think there is a broad sense among investors that sort of the bloom is off the road a bit for those opportunities, and they may not be as big and as attractive as we once would have hoped?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. If we take the three different business models we deployed in the network for 5G. I mean fixed wire access, if I take that first, that definitely is happening all the way that everybody was questioning if fixed wireless is actually something you can do. We feel really good about it. The capacity in the network is there is no problem. And as Matt said, we have deployed 60 megahertz of the C-Band, we have in average 160. So, we have so much more to go. So, that one is definitely happening. On the mobility, 5G mobility, yes, short-term is a little bit more challenging. I think that comes from both economical situation in the market. Long-term, I see the same. As I said before, the step-ups and going to higher plans is a great opportunity for us. And as you saw in this quarter, our ARPA went up. Our high-end customers continued to do step up. So, both of those are happening. And 47% of our customers has a 5G phone. And by year-end, we would probably be near at least 60%. So, I think those are happening. On the contrary, mobile edge compute and IoT, we also have a really good trend on that, has a little bit right now, and starting with private 5G networks and then it goes over to mobile edge compute, when you bring in the cloud experience in it. So, you saw that during the quarter, we announced several private 5G networks. We see more and more customers feeling that. That\u2019s a good replacement for them in order to have a secure high-capacity network instead of having WiFi in many cases. And the reason why it\u2019s happening right now is now devices are coming out. And the next couple of years, we are going to see so many more devices and not talking only about smartphones. So, I feel that it is the same opportunity that we have talked about all the time. Given the economic environment, it might be always some changes to it. But long-term, I see no difference in it. And that\u2019s how we build the network. And we are the world leader in mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. We feel that, that\u2019s a sweet spot for us. We have been all the time being very early with other 5G use case as well and feel really good where we are. So, I understand your question, Craig. But in general, I am confident that, well, this is a great opportunity for the market.\nCraig Moffett: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Craig. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So, maybe a couple. I mean first, from a price increase perspective, when you look at what you have done, it\u2019s a bigger part of your base that\u2019s absorbing the price increase than AT&T. And despite that and the growth of telco and cable revenues, the service revenue growth guidance was down and EBITDA growth was negative. So, in terms of growth, you may need to lean on other levers, I guess in order to grow margins beyond this year. So, if you could just help us understand what those levers are, especially if the macro environment starts getting weaker? I mean how do you keep your margins intact? And then secondly, there seems to be an enormous amount of handset inventory that you have built up over the last two quarters or three quarters on your balance sheet. It would be great if you could help us understand what the objective there is and if we should expect some kind of a clearing event around the holidays. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thank you, Kannan. First of all, when it comes to the margin, I mean there are many levers to run here. Of course, one is of course, continue to see that we have good opportunity to grow. And remember, we have five vectors of growth. And some of them might be more impacted if the economic and environment is turning worse, but many of them actually are playing well in the hands in a market like that, like fixed wire access, like our value brand with TracFone and all of that. So, again, I feel that we have opportunity to expand by having those performing, if it\u2019s going to be tougher on some others. And then, of course, cost. I mean we always work with cost. And as Matt has outlined several times, we work with cost efficiency and programs constantly. And now we are adding efficiency programs or enhancing what we have in order to be prepared for tougher times and being able to invest in the market. So, I think we have all the things that we should have. And I am confident that we have toolbox that we are working with. And the team is on it every day, and we will continue to be on it. It is an environment that\u2019s a little bit complicated, I think for any company at the moment. But I feel that we know what we are doing here. We are confident about our strategy. We are confident about our cash generation, and we are confident that we will be financially disciplined through this time. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes, Hans, nothing really to add on the margin side. There are obviously a number of apps forward for us. And we will \u2013 we have high expectations for the results we will produce. On the inventory part of your question, we took a decision that, I think was obviously a smart way of approach in the market to say there was more uncertainty around supply chain, both the availability of the physical item and also the supply chain\u2019s ability to deliver that item from factory to us in a predictable fashion. And so we have built some cushion into our supply chain model. And you can see that in the inventory levels. There is certainly scope for us as we feel more comfortable about the predictability of the supply chain to return inventory levels closer to historical levels is once you account for the difference in rates of the price of the product. But certainly, absolutely, I would expect to see inventory levels have the opportunity to reduce.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Kannan. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Can you talk to us a little bit about the business market with government? And any changes you are seeing there? And then at what point can we expect to see the consumer subs get back to something you are approaching a more positive growth with your current promotion strategy? Is that something more out into next year? I understand the confidence in the network and so forth, but at some point, we would like to see that kind of show up in the subs. What can \u2013 where can we expect that to start to turn?\nHans Vestberg: Yes. Thank you, Frank. Let me start with the business \u2013 with the governmental business. And of course, in governmental business a little bit longer contracts. Of course, they come up for renovation now and then. I think what we see much more is the digitalization happens in that segment as well, equally much as with enterprises and much more about us supplying all business models with digitalization and applications and support them with the ways of working. So, that has been good. And as we announced yesterday, one of them with one governmental agency definitely included that. So, we see the government going the same way as an enterprise market going with digitalization, which includes applications, wireless technology, fiber technology in order to see that their employees and their services have the latest technologies. And that I think we are playing well into, given the network we have and the confidence that everybody have in our network from, so I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening. Matt, on the consumer side?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So look, obviously, we \u2013 the team continues to work through the competitive marketplace, as I mentioned earlier. I do expect to see a topple in a little bit of a problem in churn in the third quarter here because of some customer reaction to the pricing actions we have taken. We would expect to compete effectively during the holiday season as we get into new device launches in the fourth quarter. So, I would expect us to start to show up with obviously different numbers at that time of the year. And then we will continue to work to be as competitive on a disciplined fashion in the market as we need to be.\nFrank Louthan: Alright. Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Frank. Brad, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Your final question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open sir.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Hans, I think your commentary on handset subsidies is about as strong as we have heard from you. For your premium customers, do you believe then that streaming gives you a much better mileage for your promo dollar than handset subsidies, or should we expect you to reconsider streaming subsidies as well? I am just thinking, with your new plan on the more price-conscious consumer side, is it just price that\u2019s going to swing those customers over to Verizon, or is other factors like a value offering with bundled 5G home or streaming subsidies, something that might work just as well? Obviously, the value customers have broadband and probably have streaming at home as well. Just curious how you are thinking about evolving the price-sensitive offering? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. First of all, on the different type of value services we have in the high end or in the Premium segment, if it\u2019s Disney+ or others, we think that\u2019s very important still. And we see our customers really liking it. And we have been in the forefront of this industry with these type of exclusive deals with the most prominent brands you can ever think about. We will continue to do that for our high-end customers. And that has really turned out well for us and our partners. And in \u2013 during the second half of this year as well as we announced at the Investor Day, we also want to launch a Plus Play, which is a platform for digital subscription aggregation for our customers. You have seen basically, I wouldn\u2019t say everyone because there is many in the market. But the majority of the important brands has signed up with us. So, we will continue to leverage both sort of network and service but also distribution as a service for our customers and for us in order to have the best return on investment. So, we feel good about that. And as you see in the marketplace, I mean digital subscription services is just popping up direct-to-consumer all over the place, nowhere better to work with than working with Verizon that has the biggest direct-to-consumer distribution in the market. So, we have a lot of inbounds. We are going to do it right. We are going to see that our customers and our shareholders are benefiting from it. When it comes to the question about subsidy and all of that and segmentation, and as clearly articulated, we try to be surgical in our changes, both on prices and on step-ups and all of that. And right now, the team working diligently, has been on the segment that is hitting low-end unlimited and metered plan. We are going to see and have opportunities there to bundle in other things. We are already working with our fixed wireless access offering for our customers that are wireless customers with very good value proposition. So, we will continue that and see if there are other things we need to bundle in. But right now, we have, I think a very strong positioning. And we are taking aggressive actions in the quarter, some confidence that we will continue to see improvements here over time.\nDoug Mitchelson: Alright. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Doug. Brad, that\u2019s all the questions we have for today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-22 12:27:05", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open up for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Angela. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I\u2019m here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Now let\u2019s take a look at consolidated earnings for the first quarter. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.09 per share on a GAAP basis. Reported first quarter earnings include a pretax loss from special items of approximately $1.5 billion. This includes a pretax loss of approximately $1.2 billion from early debt redemption costs. In addition, the impact of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions was $238 million. Excluding the effects of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.35 in the first quarter. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Hans to take us through a recap of the first quarter.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. Good morning and thanks for joining us for this earnings call. It was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day earlier in March. During the first quarter, the team stayed focused and continued to execute on our Network as a Service strategy. This strategy underpins our five vectors of growth and a diverse path to revenue growth that set us apart and set us up for today and tomorrow. To that end, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we made across our five vectors during the first quarter. We continued to make headway towards our long-term targets and delivered a solid start to the year, even in the phase of competitive and macroeconomic pressures. Matt will go deeper on these topics later on. With that, let\u2019s get into results at the high level. Our first quarter adjusted EPS results of $1.35 proves our ability to execute and deliver profitability. This demonstrates our unique position of having both a focused strategy and strong execution capabilities to meet the needs of our four stakeholders in the growing 5G economy. It all starts with our network expansion and execution. As you\u2019ve heard me say many, many times, mobility, broadband and cloud are the essential pieces of the 21st century\u2019s infrastructure. We\u2019re already taking advantage of this infrastructure and capitalizing on an addressable market that is growing as consumers and businesses adopt 5G. We saw this growth in our wireless sales, our customer loyalty and the rapid expansion of our fixed wireless business in this quarter. Across the business, our wireless activations were up 11% year-over-year and we delivered our best Q1 full net add performance since 2018. Additionally, our fixed wireless started to benefit from the launch of C-Band during the quarter, helping to amplify our national broadband strategy and deliver our highest broadband net adds in over a decade. We continue to deploy C-Band rapidly, enabling more and more of our customers to enjoy our Ultra Wideband experience, while also accelerating and amplifying our 5G revenue opportunities. A strategic pillar in our network expansion is our C-Band build-out, which combined with our continued millimeter wave rollout further establish and strengthens our network leadership with RootMetrics ranking us again as the most reliable 5G network in the United States and we have just started with the C-Band deployment. At the Super Bowl, we demonstrated the power of 5G to deliver new in-stadium and home experiences. For example, fans streaming the halftime show had access to multiple camera angles over our network to fully immerse in the entertainment experience, only something that can be done with 5G Ultra. This is just a taste of the new customer experience we and our partners are beginning to build on 5G Ultra. This is all based on a strong belief in giving our customers maximum optionality like Mix & Match, multi-cloud partners that allow our business customer choice for the digital transformation on 5G mobile edge compute, choice on premium experience with Verizon Up and choices of streaming services with exclusive deals only on Verizon. Just this week, we announced HBO Max will be offered on our +play platform. We\u2019re empowering our customers to choose the services they need and we\u2019re delivering on it. Our disciplined focus is reflected in our first quarter results as we saw continued momentum with step-ups and elevated device upgrades from our customers. As we previously mentioned, as technology megatrends further shift how we will work and live, 2022 is a year for Verizon to scale execution. The world continues to transition toward increased connectivity and the telecommunications industry\u2019s role in building our future has never been more vital. Through our key investments across our portfolio of assets, we will continue to build on our unique competitive position in the industry and drive growth across all of our five vectors. As we said before, 5G adoption is already much faster than what we saw when we changed from 3G to 4G. A year after 4G launched, less than 10% of the users had a compatible device. A year after the launch of 5G Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, about 24% of our customers were on 5G devices. 5G device penetration is significant and we expect it will reach 60% of our wireless consumers by the end of 2023, up from 40% at the end of the first quarter. Let me now talk about the momentum in our Business Group. Verizon Business Group continues to have a very strong momentum in wireless. I\u2019m proud to report that Tami and her team delivered the best quarterly full net adds since we formed Verizon Business Group and they are just getting started. We\u2019re also rapidly building our 5G mobile edge compute and private 5G networks. Verizon was first in the industry to offer MEC services. This quarter, we partnered with Cisco to deliver the low latency connectivity necessary for autonomous vehicles. As a partner of choice across all categories, we also made our first 5G agreement with a premium global automaker, and we will bring 5G connectivity to the next generation of Audi models starting with their 2024 vehicles. This IoT momentum expands across all our verticals with another strong net add performance this quarter. We\u2019re also seeing very promising progress in our private 5G network capabilities, offering small, mid-market and large enterprise clients, turnkey plug-and-play services. I\u2019m also pleased to share that our C-Band launch and aggressive execution, generated nationwide customer enthusiasm for our broadband offerings. Total new broadband customers were the highest in over a decade, with 229,000 net adds driven by a strong increase of 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds. And this is not the one-off. You can see from the current broadband trends that the demand for fixed wireless is extremely high and growing. In the consumer business, we grew postpaid average revenue per account by 2.6% as our users upgraded new 5G packages. ARPA growth is a major part of the strategy that we presented at the Investor Day. In the value market, the TracFone integration continues to unlock an addressable consumer market that we have only just scratched the surface on. We now have the ability to service customers in all segments regardless of the macroeconomic outlook. Manon and I are very encouraged by this opportunity and see tremendous value in the customer base Eduardo and his team have cultivated under the TracFone umbrella. The migration of TracFone subscribers from other networks continues according to plan. In addition to the result in 5G mobility, nationwide broadband, MEC and business to business and the value segment, we also see ongoing momentum in the fifth vector network monetization with growth in volumes driving incremental revenues. Of course, all of this opportunity is built on top of the best network in the industry and the deployment of our 5G Ultra Wideband technology. Kyle and team now have more than 35,000 millimeter wave sites on air and approximately 113 million POPs covered at quarter-end with C-Band. As deployment continues and device penetration ramps, traffic on our Ultra Wideband is increasing rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, 14% of all traffic in urban areas was on 5G Ultra, the result of our combined millimeter wave and mid-band spectrum. We saw a 35% increase in millimeter wave traffic between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. C-Band traffic grew 155% from the end of February to the end of March, where C-Band is deployed, 30% of our wireless traffic uses that spectrum. We have achieved this network evolution in the phase of ongoing supply chain disruption. As I mentioned in previous quarters, our supply chain management is world-class. And we have planned and executed extremely well to anticipate and meet the needs of our customers. We continue to work with our partners with a focus on our deployment targets. We remain diligent in managing a complex global supply chain and count on our expertise to help us to deal with the unexpected. As you come to expect from our technology team, progress is being made throughout our network. In March, we announced a major milestone in the advancement of our 5G network as we work with two satellite companies to secure early clearing of an additional 100 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in 30 additional markets. Rolling out our C-Band service on this spectrum will expand our 5G market by 40 million potential customers, a full year ahead of schedule. We expect to reach at least 175 million POPs by the end of 2022 on C-Band. Early spectrum clearance gives us the speed to market and accelerates the return on capital for our network investments. Having early access to these 30 major markets will support our entire business. It adds consumers and business to our addressable market. And we know from experience that we see customer interest for fixed wireless access as soon as it is available. Our network expansion also supports our mission of digital inclusion, which is key to how we serve our four stakeholders and execute our strategy according to responsible business practices. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. Today, we released our detailed environmental, social and governance report for 2021, and we are proud of our progress. The report covers our ESG strategy in detail and reflects how responsible business practices drive our business. During the first quarter, we completed allocating proceeds from our third green bond offering and issued our fourth $1 billion green bond, which is expected to be allocated towards renewable energy. We also continue to pursue long-term carbon footprint goals as described in previous quarters and in our ESG report. Third quarters have taken notice. We continue to be recognized for our sustainability efforts. During the quarter, MSCI raised our ESG rating to AA, our highest rating to date. And Sustainalytics ranked us strong in ESG risk management and low in overall ESG risk, putting us above our U.S. telecom competitors. As always, what it means to be responsible business depends on global conditions. I\u2019m proud of Verizon\u2019s relief efforts to support Ukraine, including extending free calling to and from Ukraine since the start of the war. Taken together, Verizon remains well positioned to compete this year. Our first quarter performance puts us on track for this pivotal investment year, and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term growth targets. Now I will hand the call over to Matt to address our results in detail, as well as some updates on the 2022 guidance.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans. And good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last month, we talked about 2022 as a critical year for scaling the business and making investments to position Verizon for the long-term. And this quarter, we may progress along that path. At that event, we said we expect to generate an incremental $14 billion of service and other revenue from the business by 2025, and that we expect to get there through leveraging our unique collection of assets against our five growth vectors. We expect over 75% of our growth over the next four years will come from 5G mobility and nationwide broadband. And our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our growth prospects. Our consumer and business units will measure success in mobility by how we perform in the areas of ARPA, premium unlimited penetration and subscribers and accounts. We\u2019ve talked about our plans for increasing the value of our existing base of wireless customers through step up to higher value data plans. The first quarter saw us achieve an increase in consumer postpaid ARPA of 2.6% year-over-year, positioning us for high quality revenue and earnings growth going forward. 64% of new accounts selected premium unlimited, and together with continued step-up momentum drove our premium penetration up to 36%. With respect to subscribers and new accounts, for the first quarter, we reported postpaid phone net losses of 36,000, which represents an improvement of 142,000 or 80% from a year ago and our best first quarter performance since 2018. The performance was driven by our business team, which contributed a record 256,000 phone net adds, the highest from the unit since Verizon 2.0 reporting began. These results were driven by strength in the three wireless customer groups as SMB, Enterprise, and Public Sector, each delivered double digit phone gross ad growth and extended the momentum built in the second half of last year. We expect this strong performance to continue as we approach something closer to a pre pandemic environment. On the Consumer side phone net losses were 292,000 in the quarter. While churn was study, we saw a decline in phone gross adds of 2% from the prior year. This gross add trend was more pronounced in March and is continuing into April. We will continue to take appropriate measures to be competitive in the market. We are pleased with the quality of the business that we are writing and are confident in the value of the postpaid phone gross adds we are attracting. Our retail postpaid accounts at the end of Q1 across Consumer and Business are up 40,000 from last year. Consumer and Business segment performance in the nationwide broadband vector was strong and demonstrates the opportunity to scale this business. We measure our success against this vector by households and businesses covered by broadband and the total subscribers on our networks. As Hans mentioned, the early clearance spectrum announcement is a major milestone for Verizon. Our network team is now able to deploy this spectrum a full year sooner than expected unlocking another 40 million of addressable population. We feel confident that our C-Band network will cover at least 175 million POPs by the end of this year, and will cover 50 million household and 14 million businesses with fixed wireless access by the end of 2025. The addressable opportunity expansion continues in Fios as well with 115,000 incremental open for sale in the quarter. We are seeing strong uptake in our broadband offers, and we expect increasing momentum as more and more people get access to our 5G Ultra Wideband and find service throughout the year. We had 194,000 fixed wireless access net adds across the portfolio, which is 2.5 times our 4Q 2021 performance. Consumers continue to see the benefit of the speed, reliability, and simplicity of installation of the FWA product. And businesses continue to recognize that FWA can be a primary broadband access solution for all of their needs. The total broadband, we registered 229,000 net ads representing our highest net ads in over a decade. Fios Internet contributed 60,000 net ads within the quarter, driven by record low levels of churn. Now let\u2019s move on to the MEC & B2B solutions vector. Tami and the team continue to make great progress in this space. Within IoT, the team delivered another strong quarter of connection growth. We\u2019re seeing success across our verticals, working with our customers to deliver the solutions that they need. As we mentioned during our Investor Day, we anticipate that connections will continue to grow at a double-digit pace. With our investments and key partnerships, we continue to expand the ecosystem for MEC, as well as advance our deployments in private wireless and private MEC. Our market differentiation is unmatched in terms of scale and capabilities. And we are well positioned to accelerate our long-term revenue growth within this space. Now, let\u2019s talk about the value market. Q1 marks a first full quarter of TracFone included in our consumer results. Our integration of TracFone is going as planned, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. We measure our success in the value market based on prepaid ARPU, prepaid subscribers, and prepaid revenue. Prepaid ARPU in the quarter was $30.89 across all of our prepaid brands. This declined in part because TracFone ARPU is lower than our legacy Verizon prepaid ARPU. Additionally, we saw quarter-over-quarter pressure specifically in the TracFone brands in part due to the transition from the Emergency Broadband Benefit program to the affordable connectivity program, which negatively impacted ARPUs benefits dropped from $50 to $30. Going forward, we expect prepaid ARPU to stabilize and subsequently grow as we execute in our strategy to bring additional value to this space. While we experience certain device inventory pressure throughout the quarter, especially in January, the team finished strong and delivered first quarter volumes in TracFone that compare favorably to of prior years, excluding 2021 activity, which benefited from stimulus programs. Our TracFone brands had net prepaid losses of $77,000, while total Verizon prepaid net losses in the quarter were $80,000. Next let\u2019s move to the consolidated financial results on Slide 14. On a consolidated basis, Verizon delivered strong wireless service revenue growth in a highly competitive environment in the first quarter. Total wireless service revenue growth was 9.5%, reflecting the first full quarter of TracFone ownership, as well as continued execution of our Network-as-a-Service strategy and contributions from our five vectors of growth. Service and other revenue was down 2.5% in the quarter, as the revenues lost from Verizon Media more than offset net incremental revenue from TracFone. Excluding the impact of the sale of Verizon Media, service and other revenue was up 4.2% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 billion in for the quarter down year-over-year by 1.1% do in part to elevated marketing expenses. We introduced our 5G Ultra Campaign at the beginning of the year to support our C-Band launch and FWA expansion. Combined with lower spending on the first quarter of 2021 driven by COVID-related impacts on our operations, marketing expenses represented a year-over-year drag on first quarter EBITDA growth. Other items impacting Q1 EBITDA including the disposition of Verizon Media, which had EBITDA levels above those that TracFone added in the quarter, especially considering the investment we\u2019re starting to put into the TracFone brands. We expect marketing expenses to return to more normal levels in Q2. And we will begin to lap the prior year ramp up in tower expenses, which also represented a year-over-year pressure in Q1. As Brady and Hans highlighted, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was a $1.35, relatively in line with prior year. The bottom-line performance shows the strength of our core business to deliver profitability, even in a period of significant investment, as well as other headwinds. Now let\u2019s take a look at our Consumer financial results in Q1. Total Consumer revenue for the quarter grew 10.9% year-over-year, driven by first full quarter of TracFone inclusion, higher equipment revenue, and strong core wireless service revenue growth. Wireless service revenue was up 11.2% year-over-year. These results were driven by the inclusion of TracFone as well as our increase in postpaid ARPA, which was driven by the strong step-up momentum I discussed earlier and growth within our non-connectivity products and services. Moving to File Services, we continue to see volume and rate gains with broadband of setting pressures from video and voice as total files revenue grew 1.8%. Consumer EBITDA was $10.5 billion up year-over-year by 1.0%. This growth is a result of the inclusion TracFone as well as ARPA and customer volume gains, partially offset by the items mentioned earlier, such as higher marketing expenses, investments in TracFone and higher bad debt, driven mainly by higher sales volumes in the quarter. Similarly, the higher sales activity resulted in elevated equipment revenue, pressuring EBITDA margins, which were 41.4% in the quarter. Margins were additionally pressured by the inclusion of the results of TracFone, which is a business that has historically operated with margins below the legacy consumer business. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the business financial results on Slide 16. The Verizon Business Group continues to see strong wireless sales and service momentum within the business space, alongside the ongoing wireline service declines. Wireless service revenue growth of 2.1% was led by momentum in our SMB Group, which continues to see strong post-pandemic recovery. The rate of growth is an improvement from last quarter\u2019s 1.5% and with 1Q last year representing the peak for distance learning devices, we expect Business wireless service revenue growth to expand over the rest of 2022. Business EBITDA was $1.7 billion for the quarter, down 9.3% from the prior year. The decline in EBITDA was driven in part by the ongoing reduction in high margin wireline revenue. Additionally, we experienced elevated levels of subsidy related to the strong wireless Q1 sales volume, which were up 20% year-over-year. EBITDA margin was 22.5%, similarly impacted by wireline service trends and wireless sales volumes. Let\u2019s move to Slide 17, the cashflow summary. Cashflow from operating activities for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion, compared with $9.7 billion from the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to working capital impacts as the increase in activation volumes to more normal levels impacted receivables and inventory increased as part of our supply chain management in the current environment. Capital spending for the first quarter, totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to last year, driven by C-Band spending of $1.5 billion. The continued build out of OneFiber and our investment to support growth of traffic on our 4G LTE network while expanding the reach and capacity of our 5G Ultra Wideband network great extends our opportunity to effectively compete in all of our businesses. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $1.0 billion. We exited the quarter with $135.6 billion of net unsecured debt, an increase of $1.9 billion sequentially as we issued our fourth Green Bond, with the net proceeds expected to be allocated to renewable energy. In addition, we completed a number of other transactions during the quarter the proceeds of which were used as consideration in an over $5 billion tender offer to retire some higher cost, long-term debt. We ended the quarter with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8 times flat on a sequential basis as expected. Lastly, let\u2019s move to guidance to the remainder of the year. I want to provide some additional detail around our view of the macro environment in which we operate and give context around our guidance for 2022. We saw inflationary pressures building towards the end of the first quarter and expect those to continue given the current environment. The major areas of exposure for us at energy related costs for our network operations and transportation, as well as labor related costs, including both our direct workforce and third parties. While these items have not had a significant impact on our overall results to date, they represent a meaningful portion of our direct cost structure and have the potential to drive additional expense pressure throughout the rest of the year. We also believe that the inflation we are seeing throughout the economy may alter both the consumer and business landscaping, which we compete. It is too early to predict how this change landscape may impact our near-term results or how long it will last. But we are confident that the strategy we have put in place will allow us to achieve our long-term growth plans. There\u2019s also been a significant increase in treasury yields recently, but as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt approximately 75% to 80% is fixed rate. The team has kept near-term maturities in the next 12 months to 24 months at manageable levels, which also helps minimize near-term interest rate exposure. If the present forecast of Fed rate hikes are accurate, we anticipate an incremental cash interest impact for the year above our early expectations of $150 million to $200 million. Based on our current expectations, we are updating our guidance for the year. On the revenue side, we now anticipate service and other revenue to be approximately flat to 2021, significant items affecting our service and other revenue include USF rate reductions, which are pressuring year-over-year revenue by several hundred million and softness in wireline sales. We are keeping the guidance ranges of wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Based upon our expectations around service and other revenue as well as the macro economic pressures, we now expect to come in towards the lower end of our prior guidance ranges for these items. For CapEx, we are reiterating prior guidance of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion for business as usual capital and $5 billion to $6 billion to see band related spending. We will continue to invest in the business and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities discussed during our Investor Day. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hans to close out our 2022 priorities.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Matt. Our priority about 2022 is to continue to execute on our Network as a Service strategy and to drive growth across all our five vectors. This is a critical year for scaling on our strategic investment as we work to capture all of the promise that 5G offers both from a customer experience perspective and for a future revenue growth. We made good progress in this quarter and continue to execute on our long-term plans. Our core business and our strategy showed strength and we have a solid momentum going into the second quarter, all built on the strong confidence in our strategy. Now we\u2019re ready to take your questions. Back to you Brady.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Angela, we\u2019re ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. I guess two quick follow-ups to all the data you guys provided. First of all on the EBB reimbursements, is the impact to ARPU that we saw the $5 change, is that fully reflect the changes in reimbursements? And is there any impact from a customer standpoint? And then on consumer margins, they were down 400 basis points. Is that \u2013 can you separate out the impact from TracFone had and sort of underlying trends and what was driving that and just your outlook for the how it actually trend through the year? Thanks.\nMatt Ellis: Hey, John, so good morning. Thanks for the questions. On the EEB messaging there, there\u2019s certainly - we\u2019re seeing that change in the programs as we go forward here, but no major impact on customer volumes related to that. I think your bigger question on Verizon Consumer Group and the margins we saw in the quarter. So a couple of major things in there, certainly some one-time increases in costs as we look at the quarter. We were very, very strong on our marketing spend this quarter with the launch of C-Band, new price plans, launch of fixed wireless on C-Band as well and everything around that. So that\u2019s in the quarter we would expect that to be returned to more normal levels as we head here into second quarter and go forward. And then of course, you saw the volumes up year-over-year that has some impact in there, and then Trac I mentioned in my prepared remarks so that has an impact. Initially that\u2019s going to be in the 100 basis point to 200 basis point range impact as you bring Trac into the overall VCG mix. And then as we work through the integration and bring all of the customers in Trac onto our network that impact will lessen as we complete the integration over the next 12 months to 24 months. So combination of things in there, but certainly would expect to see a little bit of a slight uptake as we head into the rest of the year here on the \u2013 our consumer margin.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, John. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Yes, thank you for taking the question. So during your prepared remarks, I think you had noted that postpaid phone gross adds had started to soften towards the end of the quarter, and that had continued into 2Q. I was hoping you could let us know what insights you\u2019ve gained into what\u2019s behind that. In other words, to what extent do you think it has to do with lower market volumes or perhaps a shift in porting ratios and some of the steps that you\u2019re going to be implementing to sort of stabilize that. And then just on the cash flow, Matt, to what extent was the higher working capital use in the first quarter really a timing issue, obviously, pre-buying inventory to manage the supply chain seems like a timing factor. But I guess with regards to just the elevated volumes, do you expect to ultimately have that offset either by selling off the receivables or just collecting the payments? Or was any of that actually associated with maybe a little bit more of a device promotion profile in the first quarter? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I\u2019ll start, Brett, and then Matt will support later on there. First of all, I mean if you look at the quarter, we had a very good wireless net adds quarter of course because if you look over the combination, our business side was very strong. Consumer also had a good quarter, but a little bit slowness as we said in the prepared remarks in March. However, if you think about it, it\u2019s logical. I mean the competition is higher as we\u2019ve seen now for a while, because we\u2019re coming into the second phase of the 5G era and acquisition of 5G customers or sort of an important piece in the market. And what we see is of course, a really good traction for us. I mean our share levels are still very low. We\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re doing upgrades and step ups all the time. So - and that\u2019s our focus, then of course, as we always say, we look into the market and we will take measured actions if it\u2019s needed. That\u2019s we\u2019ve done all the time and being very financially disciplined when we come into the market with the offerings and see if there\u2019s something we need to do. But right now I feel really good where we are. We\u2019re actually with our launch, our Ultra in the beginning of the year, it\u2019s really kept made us in a total different situation because our network is just fantastic. And that\u2019s what we see from our customers, both on fixed wireless access and both on consumer and business. And this was the whole strategy we laid out. And when we met in the beginning of March, when it comes to our overall long-term strategy, so now I\u2019m pleased what I see then is going to there be competitive market, but that\u2019s how it is and I think it\u2019s very logical and partly we are sort of coming out with so strong offerings, mix and match and all of that, so the market responding to it. So, yes, I feel good about the strategy.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. And Brett, your question on cash flows, you \u2013 in your question, you used to phrase it a timing factor in here, and I think absolutely that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re seeing. So couple of things on the receivable side with the last couple of years, we actually had some tailwinds associated with some of the impacts of the lower volumes that came through as we went through the pandemic. And now we\u2019re seeing those volumes return to more normal levels, which creates a temporary headwind, but it\u2019s really just getting back to where we were. You think about device payment levels, those are certainly up year-over-year. As we said, activations were up in the quarter 11%. Therefore, we\u2019ve more device loans on the balance sheet, but it\u2019s really getting back to those pre-pandemic levels rather than anything else. We saw an actual benefit in core customer payments that helped the year ago number with all the subsidy money out there. That was a one-time benefit that we\u2019re lapping. Customer payments continue to be incredibly strong. So we\u2019re very pleased with that. And then the inventory side, as we\u2019ve managed through some of the disruptions that we\u2019ve seen there, we\u2019ve taken advantage of the balance sheet strength we have to run it higher the normal inventory levels. But obviously, I would be looking to have us return to more normal levels on that over time here. So I expect those to be just timing factors as you said in your question and continues to be very competent in the overall strengths of the cash flows that this business produces.\nBrett Feldman: Can I say a quick follow-up question on the building at the inventory levels? I guess I just assumed that that was mobile devices. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s correct. And then just in general, how much of extra lead time have you given yourself based on the current inventory levels versus what you would typically manage towards?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. There\u2019s certainly a little bit of an increase in, it is largely what you see in the inventory side of the balance sheet there coming from handsets and so on. So there is a little bit more cushion in there in the system so to speak, which we think is appropriate given the environment that everyone\u2019s operating in. But it\u2019s certainly something that we have \u2013 we think gives us a good position in the marketplace and as supply chains become more predictable again going forward, we\u2019ll adjust that accordingly.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks, Brett. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey, sorry. I want to follow-up on the last question around the sort of wireless industry and gross adds softness in March and April. So you\u2019ve ramped up your wireless promotions for consumer, which looks more like addressing a churn issue, which I don\u2019t think is what you were calling out. Do you think that software gross adds is a share issue or is that an industry slowdown issue? And then second sort of related how does that impact your thoughts on inflation? And it sounds like AT&T is trying to signal prices higher. How do you think about the potential of this industry to be raising prices at the margin for consumers if we do see inflation starting to creep up? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Phil. I\u2019ll start with overall macro and maybe Matt will fill in a little bit about the gross adds or the question you had. On the inflation, I mean as Matt said in a prepared remarks, I mean we haven\u2019t seen so much impact so far of it. But of course, this is the high in 40 years of an inflation. So we are planning for all scenarios. We have plans to be prepared for what it takes. So that will of course include different type of cost adjustments, but also looking into what we can do with pricing. But again, we don\u2019t know how this will impact us, but clearly these levels of inflation we have never seen before in the wireless industry. So of course, that also the measurements needs to be thought through in a good way and we are doing that and we have already plans ready for it. So we are going to see what\u2019s going to happen. But clearly, we are in a moment in the economy where we really don\u2019t know how this is going to impact finally. But the levels are, of course, very high when it comes to inflation. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Phil, so your question around just what we\u2019re seeing there. Look, I would tell you that there is nothing that we see in the data that suggests any change in share out there. Certainly believe there has been a bit of a down tick in overall foot traffic, not just in our stores, but up and down the high street. But our share continues to be where we would expect it to be. Our churn continues to be very strong and that\u2019s always a good indicator of if we are competing effectively and clearly with the churn at these levels versus historical levels, we feel very good about that. So overall continuing to get our fair share and we expect to continue to do so.\nPhilip Cusick: Great. Okay. Thanks\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Phil. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: All right. Thank you very much. I wonder if we could talk about fixed wireless. Earlier in the quarter, you\u2019ve talked about doubling your Q4 numbers and you came in well ahead of that. I think you talked about wherever you open it up there\u2019s some strong demand. So perhaps just give us some colors. Has the ads been accelerating through the quarter? So is this a good jumping off point for Q2 for the rest of the year. And maybe just address you still got that $25 price point out? How are we thinking about \u2013 how long that lasts and what the footprint is today and what it\u2019s going to be once you\u2019d light up some of those more markets by the end of the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Simon. No, no, this is of course one of the five vectors of growth that we are very focused on and clearly you\u2019ll see the momentum growing for us even since we met in the beginning of March. So clearly, as we turn on more and more houses and businesses for sale, we have a good sale too, and the quarter was of course good for us. And we\u2019re coming in with the momentum into the next quarter is really good. Then, of course, as we say, we\u2019re now deploying sort of the C-Band in urban and suburban, millimeter wave is in urban, LTE is in rural. So that is really now also where the customers are coming onto. But clearly, C-Band is coming quicker in here, we only have even more opportunities. And as you heard me saying in my prepared remarks, we now also have an additional 30 markets that we\u2019ll have early clearing on this year, which gives us even more frequency is 100 megahertz. So this is adding all to this momentum we have. And remember, we have been working on this for a while. We know how to do it all the way from the sort of provision of the network capacity management, building and propositions. And that comes through the pricing as well. I think we have a good pricing at the moment with a combined offering and also the standalone offering. And we see that\u2019s making a good sort of wave in the market. But as always \u2013 we will always look into what is the right price point, which is the right type of value we\u2019re giving our customers. I think we\u2019re giving a great value and that\u2019s what we see in the numbers. So yes, we have a great momentum coming out from the quarter going into this quarter and we will continue to hammer this as we\u2019re having all the five vectors of growth constantly to see that we are reaching our long-term ambitions that we outline in the beginning of this orbit. In the beginning of March, I think that was our Investor Day wasn\u2019t time ago.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So just a couple of things add on there. So Simon, as you think about the volumes we had in the first quarter, remember, that\u2019s not a full quarter of C-Band. That came on in middle of January. And of course, you have that time period where the sales teams are building up the sales motion of selling a new product. So certainly think that we can continue to see good numbers there as we go through the rest of the year. And we\u2019re just getting started with what you saw the 194,000 in the first quarter. And from a pricing standpoint, as Hans said, it\u2019s \u2013 you should think about it that price point you mentioned is for a customer, who\u2019s also taking wireless products from us as well. On a standalone basis, it\u2019s higher price, but we\u2019ll continue to look at the pricing proposition and maximize both the value for customers, but also the opportunity for us as well.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question,\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thank you so much for taking the questions. I guess, my first question would be with respect to fixed wireless access. If we look at your numbers and the numbers, the T-Mobile\u2019s preannounced. It feels like fixed wireless access is going to be more than half the normal broadband net ads in a quarter in a normal year. And that has to be putting some pressure on the cable industry to respond unless there\u2019s a reason or an escape valve that exists because of maybe the affordability connectivity program or something. So I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about how you think the wireline broadband dynamic is going to evolve with cable and how they respond potentially in the wireless market. And the second would be a question if I could maybe Hans, there was a time when Verizon had the best network and charged the highest prices and took the most market share. And on these kinds of calls, we would talk about whether the question was really whether we wanted to give a little margin or take a little market share. You guys are now the share donor on every quarter. And we\u2019re celebrating how many 5G phones we have and how much C-Band we\u2019re deploying. But it\u2019s not obvious that\u2019s translating into something tangible that investors can celebrate in terms of financial reward. So can we talk a little bit about that too? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. We start with the fixed wireless access, I mean I can talk for ourselves and I\u2019m not sure what the response will be from someone. But this is a high quality product. The usage of the fixed wireless access is very similar to our Fios users. So this is a primary usage in the vast minority of all the cases when comes to our fixed wireless access. So this is a high quality product that definitely going to compete very well in the market. And in our case, as we said before, this means that we are nationwide with our broadband as we\u2019re expanding our C-Band and can be address more and more households. That doesn\u2019t mean that we also focus on our Fios footprint, because that is a very strong product in the ILEC we have. And you saw this quarter, again, we\u2019re doing well and continue to grow our Fios. And this year, we\u2019re going to have more open for sale on the Fios. So for us, as we create optionalities, but we only create high quality products that we believe that the customer wants and then that we are supporting. So that\u2019s why I feel good about our whole national broadband strategy that we laid out in the first quarter. So I\u2019m really pleased with that. The second question, I think that when we look at our business and I think we talked very well about at our Investor Day. Our focus is to over time grow this business with 4% and that we do with different levers and of course, based on the best network in the nation, no doubt about that. And our network is just improving and we have just started our C-Band. So we are super excited over the network we have. And then on top of that, of course, the different type of investments we have done in order to grow and to go to 4%. And that I think shareholders should be excited over. And that\u2019s what you see in this quarter as well. We are actually executing on those levers. We are ahead of plan on certain on the vectors, which is great to see and that will translate both the top line and the bottom line as we outline in our Investor Day. So that\u2019s how I see it. And we will continue to see that we are a premium brand, but remember, nowadays we can actually play in all fields on a wireless all the way from the sort of the prepaid to the high end premium and meet any type of conditions in the market with our portfolio, which is enormous strength. And on top of that, we have a scale of economy on all our offerings, because we own our network, we have built our network and all of that. So I feel really good where we have to say and where we\u2019re going and we\u2019re going compete well. I mean, I just can tell you that we feel good about it. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: If I just had one comment onto Hans\u2019 last piece there, while certainly we always want to find a higher gear and never happy with a result, I think we can do better next year. The phone ads was 142,000 battery in 1Q this year than last year. So you see us continuing to make progress there.\nDavid Barden: Thank you so much.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Angela, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Two questions. First, just curious if you\u2019re seeing different performance of gross ads, handset upgrades, and rate plan mix. When you look at your C-Band markets and your non-C-Band markets and maybe you can unpack some of that difference if there is any. And then secondly, just going back to some of the comments around guidance and you mentioned some of the possible sensitivities to the operating environment. But I was curious if you could be more specific, when you describe lower end of the ranges for wireless service revenue growth, EBITDA and EPS, what specifically is in each of those updated levels of guidance commentary. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the C-Band. Yeah, for obvious reasons, we see more excitement in the markets where we\u2019re turn on the C-Band and also some more upgrades. But remember, we are used in the beginning of the C-Band and we started within the mid basically of the quarter. So we\u2019re there in the beginning, but clearly when our customers and consumers see the C-Band turn on this year enormous performance on the network and that is just make a big difference over time. So far, maybe not so much, but clearly the excitement is out there.\nMatt Ellis: On the guidance, Mike, so as you think through it, in terms of the lower end of range on wireless service revenue. Part of that is obviously as we see the nature of the competitive environment, but it\u2019s also the volumes that you see us delivering and some of the impacts of that. So excited by 11% increase in activations year-over-year that shows strong interest from our customers, but that of course does mean that we see the amortization impact from promo come through the wireless service revenue and so we\u2019ll see that impact there. That of course will also impact the EBITDA guidance, but EBITDA guidance also has our views on inflation as well as we think about the year as a whole and certainly those views have evolved over the has 90 days for everyone as well. And then so obviously EBITDA impacts the EPS guidance and the EPS also has the interest expense that I commented on in my prepared remarks that it\u2019s probably the low-single digit impact on an EPS basis that obviously come through as a result of higher Fed hikes and was probably in people\u2019s plans at the start of the year. So a number of factors impact in each of those items. We still feel very confident in the results of the business we\u2019ll produce this year and the momentum that we\u2019re building in the year across the growth vectors to deliver the long-term aspirations that we all have.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. It\u2019s helpful.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Mike. Angela, ready for the next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Yes. So if I think about the wireless business as kind of the, the traditional P times Q where at the moment you\u2019re not growing either subscribers or ARPU in the traditional sense for phone. How much is your guidance dependent on revenue growth outside of that P times Q? I\u2019m thinking in particular about private network and mobile edge comput; you\u2019ve talked a lot about the new 5G revenue streams. How much are we actually going see that in the current year? And how much does it contribute to your forecast?\nMatt Ellis: Yes. Thanks Craig. So as you think about it, so when you look at the P times Q that you mentioned, we got ARPU up to 2.6% on the postpaid side. So certainly see a continuation of executing on the strategy. We\u2019ve talked about of stepping customers up, getting more customers on premium plans. The team continues to do a good job there and you see that in the, a side. You also see as we mentioned an increase in the number of accounts on wireless year-over-year, 40,000 more accounts this year than this time a year ago. So the P times Q there works, but this comes back to what we talked about at the Investor Day, having five vectors of growth and really what we talked about there is just one of them. In addition to that, obviously we\u2019ve got fixed wireless access kicking in now, 194,000 net ads in the first quarter, over 400,000 in the base that\u2019s exactly in line with what we said you should see with increasing the base this year and therefore that having a more meaningful impact on revenue in 2023, but we\u2019re building that base now in line with what we said. And then you laid out the things like MEC and obviously on that not just within the B2B space, mobile edge compute but also as we get into the 5G world. The scope of opportunity for IoT, a machine to machine continues to increase, and we talked about the momentum we have there, and that\u2019s just really getting started. On the prepaid side we continue to see that the integration of TracFone going as expected and we expect that to add value as we go forward here, and then we continue to see growth in our network monetization vector too. So we still feel very confident that we have the ability to grow across more vectors than other people that starts with mobility and extends into the other one, but absolutely think you\u2019ll see growth across all of those. Hans?\nHans Vestberg: No, I think that adding on the mobile edge compute, and we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks, but clearly we see the market now with the whole ecosystem coming in there. And we as the pioneer and the leader in the market definitely have more engagement that we had before. People think little bit to private networks in the beginning 5G private networks and then you build on the mobile edge compute on that. So now I see this as a traditional B2B and not only that it\u2019s definitely clearly a way for us to build new relationship with our enterprise customer. But I said before this year we are building that funnel, we\u2019re making it, and of course when come to meaningful revenue, a little bit higher that\u2019s going to be more next year. So, but clearly this year we\u2019re going to talk a lot about and show you what we\u2019re doing, the solutions we have and remember also we have the smaller solution for SMBs when it comes to private 5G networks. We see so many use cases, and remember all is built on how we built the network from the beginning where we basic from the data center to the edge of the network, have one unified network which is fibered. And then at the edge of the network, we can do different solution for different type of customer groups. This is going to pay off big time the next five to 10 years and I feel really good about how we built the network and seeing also the importance of mobility broadband and cloud in our society for businesses and people. I think we\u2019re so well placed in this, so I feel good about it.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Craig.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Hey, Angela, ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. I\u2019m just curious on the long-term ambition to build out C-Band that your Phase 1 and Phase 2 is pretty clear through 230 million POPs. Is there attractive returns building out C-Band beyond that? Is there a Phase 3 and what\u2019s the timeframe for that? Just trying to get a line of sight on the long-term capital intensity? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, it is more \u2013 more ambition to continue. When it comes to capital intensity, I think we outlined that very clearly that we will have the peak year now, then we\u2019re coming down. And then in 2024, 2025 we will have a BAU that is below 12%, which is of course over a decade, the lowest we\u2019ve had, but that is coming from the investment levels we have done and prepared the network. In there of course we have the BAU expansion on C-Band, so that\u2019s clear and already right now as you know, we have moved up. So now we will have doing at least 175 million POPs covered this year. And then of course that means also that other pieces of the network will come earlier and topping that with so far, we\u2019re only using 60 megahertz, now we\u2019re adding 100 megahertz in the next 30 markets. But remember in average we 161 megahertz nationwide and in many and mostly in the rural areas, we\u2019re up to 200 megahertz. So of course we invested in this spectrum in order to be extremely competitive and do things that nobody else can do. So we going to continue to do it, but that doesn\u2019t change the profile that Matt and I laid out when it comes to capital intensity. That\u2019s included, but clearly we\u2019re going to take advantage of the investments we\u2019ve done and the sooner we do it, the better it is.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So Doug, just add onto that a little bit. If you think about network usage and customers demand on the network continues to grow year-over-year that\u2019s true across every geography. So you should expect no difference in how we think out C-Band rollout to get 5G Ultra Wideband to all of our customers, the same way we did with LTE rollout a decade ago. And as you saw with the LTE rollout, as we got out of the initial launch areas to more nationwide, we did that within our overall CapEx envelope and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve described that you should expect from us as we do the same thing with C-Band and get the 5G experience to all of our customers as soon as possible here.\nDoug Mitchelson: All right. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Great. Thanks, Doug. Angela, we\u2019ve got time for one more question. Can we do the last question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Your last question comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I guess first I wanted to ask you if you\u2019ve seen any change in the composition of your postpaid phone, gross ad mix over the past few quarters in terms of different segments of the market both in consumer and business. And that more recently you talked about the softness in March and April. Are there any pockets of strength or weakness that you would call out underneath of that overall pressure you\u2019ve been seeing in March and April? Or is it pretty broad based? And then separately, I just wanted to ask you a follow up on Fios. I think you\u2019ve got to a 550,000 increase in Fios premises past this year. Are you giving any consideration to accelerating that pace over the next few years, given what seemed to be improving economics for fiber broadband across the industry? Or do you think that fixed wireless is just a better way to approach the vast majority of your ILEC footprint that hasn\u2019t been upgraded to Fios? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can start with the second one because I remember it, and I will come to the wireless customers. So on the Fios you\u2019re right, 550,000 open for sale this year, which is an increase from 2021. And we will continue to look for opportunities to expand as our customers are allowing the product. So there are no limitation on that. That\u2019s of course of the focus is in the ILEC when we\u2019re doing the expansion outside that we \u2013 we predominantly working with fixed wise access. So ultimately we want to give high quality products on broadband that can be used for everything you need in a home or in a business and that\u2019s what we\u2019re catering for either to fixed wireless access on Fios. So we going to continue to see if we accelerate depending on customer demands, but clearly as we\u2019re increasing Fios this year compared to last year, we see that happening, and our capture rate on Fios is of course magnificent, it\u2019s great. We\u2019re really strong on it. When it comes to the wireless customers and I guess I don\u2019t 100% remember the questions, so Matt will probably support me at the end there. But one thing that we need to remember the strength of a SMB, for example, that we\u2019ve had now for many quarters that is a clearly a segment that is doing when on wireless, then on the same time as Matthew said, we see our customers continue to do upgrade and step ups. That is part of our strategy and that we\u2019re seeing in our base constantly. So I don\u2019t think that is a big difference from previous quarters we\u2019ve seen before, but I\u2019m not sure maybe Matthew have something more than that.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So on the comments about March and April volumes, those are predominantly on the consumer side, nothing particular in terms of breaking the consumer apart there in terms of particular areas. But as Hans said the VBG site, Verizon Business Group continues to do very strong performance across small business, enterprise, public sector, double-digit growth and gross ads across each of those parts of Tami\u2019s business in the first quarter. And that really fairly even throughout the quarter. So we saw a little lower foot traffic on the consumer side, but the business side continues to perform at a fairly even level throughout the quarter and as we head into Q2 here.\nBryan Kraft: Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Angela, we\u2019re ready to finish the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2024-01-23 12:37:05", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. We'd like to note that Verizon's fourth quarter reporting earnings per share were negatively impacted by a number of special items, which are discussed in the written remarks available on our Investor Relations website. The largest of the impacts was also disclosed in our 8-K filing last Wednesday. Excluding these special items, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.08. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I hope you all had a great start of 2024. I'm pleased to report that Verizon closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, finishing off a year of solid operation and financial performance. For us, 2023 was a year of continuous improvement and important actions across the business. We made significant changes to how we operate and to our team, and those changes paid off. We stabilized our core business and positioned the company for renewed growth and profitability. We built strong momentum quarter after quarter, culminating in a very good holiday season. And finally, we met the guidance that we provided to you in each of our key performance indicators. Entering 2024, Verizon stands ready to further unlock our performance potential at an accelerating rate. We now have all the assets, the best team in the business, and a focus on continued operational excellence to deliver even better results going forward. Let me share some full-year highlights with you. Wireless service revenue for 2023 was $76.7 billion, a 3.2% year-over-year increase. We delivered outstanding volumes during a healthy fourth quarter where our customers clearly embraced our offerings. Full-year adjusted EBITDA was $47.8 billion, contributing to a very strong free cash flow of $18.7 billion, reflecting our disciplined and strategic approach to profitable growth. As a result of our financial strength, we raised our dividend for the 17th year in a row with a healthy free cash flow dividend payout ratio of approximately 59%. We also reduced our year-over-year leverage, while continuing to bring CapEx back towards business as usual levels. This aligns with the capital allocation priorities we have shared in recent years. These results provide a solid foundation for Verizon's journey and future success. And I'm pleased that we put the leadership and team in place last year that will serve Verizon stakeholders well in both the short and long term. We as a team have focused on capturing the market opportunity, and I'm proud of our progress in 2023. Just two weeks ago, Leslie Berland joined Verizon as our Chief Marketing Officer. I'm excited to bring her on board and have a great confidence in her ability to continue shaping Verizon's premium brand perception and story. We started 2023 determined to differentiate ourselves by investing even more in profitable growth while transforming Verizon to make the company more efficient and effective. Seeing the continued strength of the U.S. consumer, busy holiday store traffic and rising demand for mobility, broadband and private networks, we also took actions to fuel growth during the fourth quarter, and it showed in our results. A standout milestone in 2023 was our launch of myPlan, which was designed from extensive customer research to be the most flexible plan available to U.S. consumers from any wireless company. myPlan has been a great success that has seen stellar adoption. Introduced in May, we already have 13.1 million myPlan subscribers. And these customers using premium packages and our unique perks driving ARPA. Other changes we made in 2023 include establishing a regional distribution model, tailoring our approach to every market, revamping sales composition to support productivity and introducing new price plans and promotions in Consumer and Business. Verizon Business also partnered with HCLTech to be more efficient to deliver post-sale implementation and customer support for managed network services, enhancing our customer service while saving Verizon money. These actions paired with all of our assets sets us up very well for 2024. We are now working from an effective model and this is just the start. Overall, the wireless industry is strong as we head into 2024, and we are confident in our strategy. We have great offerings with optionality to meet the needs of customers of any budget on the best network in the country. Now, let me share a bit more how each of our service performed in the fourth quarter. Starting with mobility. We had 449,000 postpaid phone net adds, driven by improving net adds in Consumer and a continued sustainable performance in Verizon Business. Our disciplined and segmented market approach is working with customers and creating great economics for our shareholders. In Consumer, you can see the pattern of continuous improvements from the start of the year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered our best postpaid phone gross adds performance since 2019 and our best net adds in two years. We added 318,000 postpaid phone customers in the fourth quarter and our gross adds were up almost 17% year-over-year. It is clear that we have momentum in Consumer as we move into 2024, and we'll continue to work to get our fair share on new business. Our customer-centric offers are resonating in the market, and we're just getting started. By leveraging Verizon's large subscriber base and key partnership, we can deliver exclusive discount offers like Netflix and Max for just $10 a month, underscoring our industry leadership in value-driven content offerings. With our vast network coverage and the largest base of loyal customers, we're uniquely positioned to provide targeted high-value deals that deepen relationship across connected devices, streaming and more. Within the value business, which includes our prepaid offerings like TracFone, Visible and Total by Verizon, we still have work to do but are making progress. Moving to Verizon Business. The team continued to deliver on mobility with total postpaid phone net adds of 131,000 for the fourth quarter 2023, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of postpaid phone net adds above 125,000. For the full year, Business added 562,000 phone net adds, an outstanding result. Our Business customers are prioritizing mobility and value the optionality we offer with highly-tailored plans on the best network in the country. Now, let's turn to broadband. For the year, we had more than 1.7 million broadband net adds, with more than 1.5 million net adds from fixed wireless access and 248,000 net adds from Fios, a nice increase over 2022. On fixed wireless access, we're consistently adding more than 350,000 subscribers per quarter, which is part of our plan for steady, sustainable growth that exceeds what we expected at launch. Just three years of the launch, we serve more than 3 million fixed wireless access customers, well ahead of our stated goal of 4 million to 5 million subscribers by the end of 2025. With fixed wireless access, we're expanding into new markets and proving the value of Verizon's connectivity. Customers are finding strong reliability and speed in fixed wireless access and that shows in our results, including a very strong Net Promoter Score. For a product that still is in the beginning, the pace of adoption has the team super excited. We expect this will be a long-term source of recurring revenue for Verizon, and we're entering this year with a strong base for continued growth. Turning to the private networks and our 5G business solutions. We continue to see interest from large enterprises running complex logistics and operations like ports, automotive and heavy industries. In November, Norfolk International Terminal contracted us to build a second private 5G network for them. Audi, already one of our partners in smart car development, has contracted us to build a private network for their automotive tech testing environment. And Nucor, one of the country's largest steel companies, has us building private networks for three of its sites with more to come over the next year. Strategically, we're building a new source of revenue expansion where we are the clear leader. Last year, we also expanded existing 5G private networks partnerships with NFL to bring new spectator and retail experience to fans everywhere. When we build relationships with these large enterprises and they see what our network can do for them, there is always potential for more business. And our network is just getting better and better every day. With full access to our spectrum as of the end of third quarter last year, our mission is to optimize the experience in every market and expand into suburban and rural markets, where we know our consumer and business customers are eager to take up our offerings. We have been expanding and improving our network in key markets through 2023 and into this year. I have said it before and I will say it again, our network is the foundation how we offer the best value and premium experience to our customers. And we're now seeing our investment in C-Band paying off in terms of customer experience and loyalty. Where we have C-Band, we see higher gross adds, lower churn and more step ups to premium services. We also see increased uptake of customers taking both mobility and broadband services. Meanwhile, millimeter wave, which we have now deployed in many urban areas and all 30 NFL stadiums, sets Verizon apart with an outstanding performance at high density areas and public event spaces. And for the 32nd consecutive time, Verizon was the most awarded company in the country for wireless network quality, with the first place rankings in each of J.D. Power's six regions. We are the network that America relies on, and we take that commitment very seriously. Looking ahead, our priorities for 2024 are crystal clear. We remain laser-focused on growing wireless service revenue and expanding our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to allow for a meaningful debt reduction in the year ahead. This is what our whole team is working towards and what you, our shareholders, and our Board want us to focus on. Tony will have more details for you, but we anticipate strong wireless service revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% in 2024, which reflects our ability to sustain the top-line of our business as we continue to pursue the right balance of profitability and customer growth. Our adjusted EBITDA profile will continue to improve as we become even more efficient with growth, cost saving measures and our disciplined promotional spending. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And as we lower our capital intensity from the C-Band build out and our new business structure, we expect to see continued strong free cash flow generation going forward. That will enable our Board to continue to raise our dividend and also enable us to bring down leverage. Now, Tony will discuss the quarter as well as our operations and guidance in more detail.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Executing on our plan, we finished the year strong and delivered on our financial guidance. We exited the year with good momentum and remain committed to our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In 2023, we set out to improve our operational performance while sustaining financial discipline. Our fourth quarter and full year results confirm that our strategy is working and that we can deliver strong financials and improve key operating metrics. Consumer postpaid phone net adds totaled 318,000 for the quarter, a substantial improvement of 369,000 sequentially and 277,000 compared to the prior year. Our Consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.88% represents a stable result even after we implemented over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023. While we do not provide specific guidance on volumes, we wanted to share a couple of items as we look into 2024. In the first quarter, we are taking additional targeted pricing actions that we expect will result in incremental pressure on Consumer postpaid phone churn in the period. However, we expect to deliver positive Consumer postpaid phone net adds in full year 2024 as we execute on our strategy of growing our subscriber base while being financially disciplined. Postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter were up nearly 17% year-over-year. This represents our best quarterly Consumer gross add performance in four years. Our attractive myPlan offers combined with our segmented approach to the market, regional sales structure and disciplined promotional strategy continued to deliver strong results. Additionally, postpaid upgrades remained lower as compared to the prior year. The Consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4% in the fourth quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year as a result of approximately 19% fewer upgrades. As Hans said, we continue to see better performance in markets where we have deployed C-Band. In our first 76 C-Band markets, fourth quarter Consumer postpaid phone gross add growth was 8 percentage points better than in non-C-Band markets. Additionally, Consumer postpaid phone churn in C-Band markets was 4 basis points better than in non-C-Band markets. The strong momentum in the quarter combined with the continued deployment of our C-Band network positions us well in 2024. The quality of the business we are writing in Consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive premium plan adoption. The premium take rate in C-Band markets for the quarter was more than 10 percentage points higher than in non-C-Band markets. Consumer ARPA of $134.10 represents an increase of 4.7% year-over-year. This was driven by new customer additions, premium plan adoption and fixed wireless subscriber growth. We expect continued and healthy organic ARPA growth in 2024. Our prepaid results remain challenged in the fourth quarter. This is in part to seasonally weaker national retail sales volumes, which is the primary sales channel for our TracFone brands. We also continue to see pricing pressures from low-end postpaid offerings. Prepaid net losses for the quarter were 289,000. During the quarter, we saw continued strong growth within the Visible and Total by Verizon brands, which we will continue to scale. The team is also focused on our partnerships to improve the performance of the Straight Talk brand. We believe we're taking the right steps to better position our offerings in the market and expect to see some stabilization in 2024. Verizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 131,000 phone net adds, which as Hans mentioned, is our 10th consecutive quarter above 125,000. The Business Markets Group had its best phone net add performance in the last two years, demonstrating how our value proposition is resonating with small and medium businesses. Similar to Consumer, we are taking pricing actions in the first quarter in Business that could result in elevated phone churn in the period. However, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong business volumes in 2024. Moving on to broadband, we delivered 413,000 net additions in the quarter continuing the pace of over 400,000 broadband net adds for the fifth consecutive quarter. We see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless offerings, and we continue to see positive responses from customers regarding the quality and reliability of our services. In fixed wireless, we delivered 375,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to over 3 million subscribers. We launched C-Band in early 2022, and our fixed wireless success in the last two years reflects the strong demand for high-quality broadband and the strength and reliability of our product. Notably, in the fourth quarter, over 80% of our consumer fixed wireless gross adds came from C-Band markets. The growth trajectory for fixed wireless continues to be robust and we are ahead of schedule to achieve our 4 million to 5 million subscriber goal by year-end 2025. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, down 4,000 year-over-year. We are pleased with the success of Fios with strong gross adds and retention, reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. We expect broadband subscriber momentum to extend into 2024 as we continue deployment of our C-Band spectrum, further expand our Fios footprint and bring new products and offers to the market. Let's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $35.1 billion, down 0.3% year-over-year. This change can be attributed to the wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 2% lower than the prior year as total postpaid upgrades declined by approximately 18%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.4 billion, up 3.2% year-over-year. Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans and growth in fixed wireless access. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduced total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points year-over-year as well as promo amortization. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $11.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the prior year. Higher wireless service revenue and the benefits of lower upgrades were more than offset by higher marketing and bad debt expense and ongoing declines in Business wireline revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.2% was relatively flat year-over-year. In 2023, we implemented transformations within our Consumer customer care group as well as Business managed services. We are pleased with what we have achieved this year and our cost saving measures are meeting our expectations. We expect further progress on our cost efficiency program in 2024. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 in the quarter, resulting in full year adjusted EPS of $4.71. Turning to our cash flow summary, cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $8.7 billion, bringing the total for 2023 to $37.5 billion. This marks a year-over-year improvement of over $300 million, primarily due to working capital improvements. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.6 billion compared to $7.3 billion in the prior year. The full year CapEx totaled $18.8 billion, which represents a more than $4 billion reduction in capital spending from 2022 as we come down from our peak C-Band spending level. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $4.1 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $18.7 billion, a $4.7 billion increase over the prior year, driven by operational improvements and the lower CapEx spending that we previously noted. We are pleased to have delivered on our guidance of more than $18 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which reflects our balanced and strategic approach to delivering profitable growth. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.4 billion, a $1.6 billion improvement year-over-year. Net unsecured debt increased sequentially primarily due to settling the $3.7 billion in incentive payments to satellite operators for our remaining C-Band spectrum. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the fourth quarter, in-line with the prior two quarters. We expect deleveraging of the balance sheet to accelerate in 2024 as CapEx comes down to BAU levels and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our approach to managing long-term debt and have only $3.6 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2024. Overall, I'm pleased with our momentum exiting the year and our performance in 2023, delivering an improved operational profile while also meeting our financial guidance. Now, I want to take a few moments to look ahead and walk through our 2024 guidance. Our 2024 guidance demonstrates our expectations for accelerating wireless service revenue growth. As a reminder, the reported 2023 wireless service revenue growth of 3.2% included approximately 190 basis points of benefit from a reallocation of other revenues. Excluding this reallocation, the 2023 wireless service revenue growth was 1.3%. For 2024, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2% and 3.5%. This will be driven by anticipated positive postpaid phone net additions in both Consumer and Business, continued fixed wireless access subscriber growth, further adoption of premium unlimited plans, growth in products and services, and pricing action benefits. We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA to grow by 1% to 3% versus the prior year. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue and the impact of our cost transformation initiatives, partially offset by continued pressure in Business wireline revenues and increased wireless network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.50 to $4.70. As noted, we expected adjusted EBITDA to grow in 2024, offset by certain below-the-line impacts. Specifically, higher interest expense is expected to impact adjusted EPS by $0.16 to $0.19, over 75% of which is driven by the continued reduction in capitalized interest related to the C-Band licenses being placed into service. In addition, EPS is expected to be impacted by approximately $0.07 to $0.09 of higher pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to the expiration of certain credits. This impact will flow through the other income and expense line on our income statement. We expect depreciation and amortization to be relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24% based on current legislation. As discussed in prior quarters, capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $17 billion and $17.5 billion, down from $18.8 billion in 2023. While we are not providing guidance on 2024 free cash flow, we wanted to provide some additional color to aid with your analysis. Tailwinds to free cash flow will come from our adjusted EBITDA growth outlook as well as the expected $1.5 billion reduction in CapEx in 2024 based on the midpoint of our guided CapEx range. Offsets will be higher interest expense and higher cash taxes. As a reminder, the majority of the higher interest expense relates to reductions in capitalized interest. Such interest was recognized in cash flow from investing prior to placing the C-Band spectrum into service. The higher cash taxes are primarily related to the continued phaseout of bonus depreciation in 2024 based on current legislation. Overall, we expect a strong free cash flow profile that will support our capital allocation priorities and position us for meaningful unsecured debt reduction in 2024, which we expect to come in the latter half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans for his closing thoughts.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. As you heard today, we're confident and well positioned to deliver a solid 2024. Thanks to our best-in-class network, which is only getting better, we offer the mobile and broadband services that customer value and need the most. Our industry is critical to the next wave of innovation, and Verizon is ready to capitalize on the opportunity of the AI economy to bring this technology to life for all our stakeholders. As I said in the beginning, we have the right team in place to execute the next chapter in Verizon's history. I'm proud of the work our team accomplished in 2023 and excited what we will deliver in 2024. Our results in C-Band markets speaks for themselves and support our investment decisions, and we're going to lean in further as we expand into suburban and rural markets while maintaining the financial discipline you come to expect from us. We will continue to stay very close to our customers to understand their needs and preferences, so that we can offer the right promotions at the right times in the right markets. We have the right people, the right assets and the right strategy. Our focus for 2024 is on execution. It's a winning combination, and we are very confident heading into this year. Finally, I want to remind you that we are hosting an investor event on February 5 and encourage everyone to tune in to the webcast. Given the financial update today, next month will be more of an operational and strategic update on the company. Now, Brady, we're ready to take questions.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I'd love to drill down on the couple of things. Firstly, the sub trends, 17% growth is some real momentum. I know, Hans, you talked about a number of sort of potential drivers, but if there's anything you could sort of be specific and sort of talk about what drove that in the quarter and is that likely to continue? Also, the account growth, is that likely to continue? And then, you talked about some churn on the price increase. Anything you could say about sort of the net add momentum as we look into '24? That's first. And maybe for Tony, nice service revenue growth. Any additional info you can kind of give us to sort of unpack that in terms of the price increase impact versus last year and what you're seeing in terms of tier, that would be great. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Hey, John, thank you for the question. So, let me start about the subs then. On the Business side, 10th quarter in a row, more than 125,000. Kyle and his team is doing a great job. We are -- our network is performing so well, so our customers just continue to buy in with us. Not only that, our offerings in our go-to-market is as strong as ever. So, we feel really good about what Kyle and his team is doing. On the Consumer side, yeah, we had a good fourth quarter, but you have seen also through the year that we have sequentially improved all the time. Everything started where we started with a new offering, myPlan, which resonates with the market, very much consumer insights in it. Then on top of that, Sampath has done a lot of changes in our structure, all the way from the go-to-market, the incentives in our stores and our decentralization of it. So, it hangs together all the way. So, I think the most important, we have the right offerings in the market and that has really resonated on the Consumer side. So, I'm really happy with the team. We will continue to execute on the plan we have and we have started.\nTony Skiadas: Hey, John, it's Tony. Good morning. So, just to add on to what Hans mentioned, we did really well in Tier 1 markets. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, about 8 percentage points better, and we were also net add positive in both Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets as well. We improved our competitive positioning against all providers. We continue to build out C-Band as we said earlier and -- in suburban and rural markets and we see further opportunity there. And as Hans mentioned, we have strong momentum in the VBG side as well on both mobility and FWA. So, good results. And then, on your question on service revenue, so we feel really good about the shape of service revenue in 2024. The guidance that we gave of 2% to 3.5% reflects accelerated growth, and we talked about the jump off point of 1.3% in the prepared remarks. The midpoint of our guidance range implies over $2 billion of service revenue growth. If we think about the assumptions in the guide, in terms of tailwinds, as you know, we've executed a number of pricing actions, both in the back half of 2023 that do carry into 2024, as well as in recent weeks, we've taken further pricing actions in both Consumer and Business that will provide a tailwind. We also have an improving volume profile in our Consumer business. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in Consumer in 2024 and stable Business volumes as well. And then, the third tailwind I'd point to is an increasing contribution from fixed wireless access. We have really good momentum and over 3 million subs in the base. In terms of headwinds, prepaid has been a drag on service revenue both in the fourth quarter and the full year. It was about $142 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect the prepaid headwinds continue into 2024 as we stabilize that business. And then on promo amortization, that continues to be a headwind with the increase in 2024 similar to the increase we experienced in 2023. But when you put that all together, we like the trajectory of service revenue.\nJohn Hodulik: That's great detail. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yes, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Just following up there on the fixed wireless, could you just give us a little bit of color around how the churn is performing? What are you seeing in terms of those cohorts that have had the service for some time? And any comments on sort of capacity and so forth? And also, are you seeing emerging seasonality in this product driven by strong back-to-school in Q3 and then maybe a little bit softer in Q4? And then, anything you can -- color you can provide on your exposure to ACP and how that may affect you and your latest thoughts on the BEAD program? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. Thank you. On the fixed wireless access, I think the product is maturing. We're now past 3 million subs, both on the Business side and Consumer together. Clearly, the rollout and the product is unique. It has -- it resonates so good in the market, the simplicity of the product and installing it, which was our idea. And even if we took out the discount that we had in the third quarter, we haven't seen any slowdown. The product is resonating so well. We are constantly improving it. The NPS is really high on the product. And as I said so many times before, for us is to keep the same volume right now because that we are dimensioning our capacity, our capital in the best way, it's the most efficient way. So, we will continue to be in these levels, and we think they're very important. And topping that, of course, that -- our consumers using fixed wireless access that they are using the network as anybody else. And as I said before, we have dimensioned the network to handle it, so that's not the challenge. And the most important for us is that we have fiberized all our network, and so we can transport all the data. The guys are doing great job on fixed wireless access across the board.\nTony Skiadas: Yeah. And then just one additional point there. So, the longer-dated churn, Simon, is very strong, and we're very pleased with the progress thus far. On your other question, on ACP, just maybe a few points to make here. The guidance assumes that the ACP funding remains intact. In the event the funding goes away, we have plans to address it and we'll see what happens there. The majority of the exposure on ACP is in our prepaid business. We have about 1.2 million prepaid subs that benefit from the ACP program, and that's less than 10% of our prepaid base. On the postpaid side, we have minimal exposure to ACP, both Fios and postpaid wireless. And the margin exposure from ACP is very, very small.\nHans Vestberg: And on the BEAD program, we will participate when that comes out in the market where we see we can compete and where we see a good return on investment. We have already won a couple in the early stages, but we expect that this will roll out over years to come. And -- but again, we will see that we participate when it makes sense for us usually -- or not usually, always with financial discipline.\nSimon Flannery: Great. And just one follow-up. On the fiber build, is that again about 500,000 homes passed this year?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah, Simon, it will be a little bit over 400,000 next year.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks so much.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, thank you. I think you said you expect postpaid phone positive for the year. What's the durability of consumer growth? Could that also be positive for 2024? And remind us the impact that price increases tend to have on churn over the last couple of years. And then second, maybe you could just dig into where your gross adds are coming from, the improvements as you're doing better there? Churn has sort of been in-line, but gross add is doing a lot better. If you could dig into that? Is there any significant shift in where customers are coming from, maybe from the myPlan? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Sure. I can just start by saying, but I'm going to hand it over to Tony, I think you're spot on. On myPlan, and I said it in my opening remarks, stellar performance so far on myPlan. But it's not only that the plan is good, it's both flexible, you have cost control and our customers get value of it. And I think that goes back to the what I talked about for years, disciplined approach, but also very segmented. And that's what's happening right now, and we can see that we allocate money to the right product, to the right customer in the right market. So, there's a lot of that. But Tony will give you a little bit of rundown on the numbers.\nTony Skiadas: Sure. So, just, Phil, on the churn, I mean, obviously, we'll see a little bit of an uptick from the pricing changes we made in both Consumer and in Business, and those changes were announced in the last few weeks. And then, as Hans mentioned, we really had good performance in Consumer. You saw the gross add number at 17% and 10% for the full year, and that's despite being in a much lower upgrade environment as well. So, we feel really good. Like I said earlier, the Tier 1 markets were very strong and we see further opportunity as we build out C-Band. The churn profile is much better. The ARPA is much better. So, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing so far with C-Band and the performance.\nPhil Cusick: And in terms of the durability of postpaid and growth there?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah. Look, we said we're going to be postpaid phone positive in Consumer in 2024, and we'll also continue to see strong momentum in Business as well. We did 562,000 net adds this year, and Kyle and the team did a great job, and we expect continued solid growth from the Business side as well.\nPhil Cusick: That's great. Thanks for everything, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open, sir.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good morning. Just one more on wireless pricing. Can you provide some additional context on how you're seeing the competitive landscape evolve with respect to pricing, and how Verizon is trying to balance the volume versus price equation as you look out from the recent pricing actions that you've taken? And then second, can you provide an update on how much the cost-cutting program yielded in '23, and how much you can capture it in '24 relative to the previously articulated target? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Mike. I think when it comes to our pricing and our promotions, I think we look more about we are the leader in the market. We look at the different segments we have to see that we have the right offerings for right customer with the right value. That's the focus we have had for, I would say, the last two years, very much focused on our customer base and the consumers and the customers we can attract to Verizon. And so far, that disciplined approach we have. You saw the fourth quarter, for example, we invested a little bit more because we have really good momentum. So sometimes, we're going to invest more, but it's always going to be with return on investment in mind to see that we're doing the right for all our stakeholders. So that's the focus we'll have on the pricing we have both on broadband and on wireless. On the cost program, '23 was a big year for us. You're probably following all our press releases, but we did a lot in customer care. We did a lot with the managed services with outsourcing with HCL. We implemented some really large IT systems and application that's going to be a fantastic platform. We continue to deploy our offshore centers and being even stronger using that as a platform on the basis that we created the Verizon Global Services, the 1st of January '23. So, I'm really pleased with the platforms, and that means we're on track for the savings we talked about going into '24, it's more about the same. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Sure. So, just to add a couple of things here. So, on 2023, we delivered about $300 million to $400 million in savings. And as Hans mentioned, we expect the program to ramp in 2024 and the savings are contemplated in the guide. A portion will hit the bottom-line while also giving us the flexibility to invest in the business. And I think you saw that in the fourth quarter and the results speak for themselves. We're not going to give specific cost targets, but what -- in addition to what Hans mentioned, we have work going on in IT platform transformation, real estate and fleet optimization, and we're also opening up a shared service center in Ireland. So, we feel really good about the cost actions that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you see in the guidance for this year.\nMichael Rollins: And just one other. Where are you in process of restructuring the Business wireline operations? And how close are you to an inflection where that segment can stabilize financially or potentially eventually grow at some point? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Mike. No, that's a big focus for us. We have the secular decline, and we've had that for quite a while. So, there's nothing new and nothing new to that story. But our cost efficiency is, of course, happening very, very quickly, and the team is doing a great job. Not only that, we also see that we have the right pricing for our customers and also seen where we don't have great contract, we have decided to walk away from them. So, very much tackling -- blocking and tackling to see that we'll continue to improve. And of course, our target is to get that to sort of being neutral to our P&L over time. And that is one of the important pieces for getting the 25% of the Verizon Business Group in EBITDA. But not only that, of course, we're offsetting that by growing our wireless business and our broadband business. So, typical management of product portfolio, and I would say Kyle and the team is doing a great job with the full support from Tony and me.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. So, you made a lot of changes in the last year to kind of retail marketing to correct some of the past periods. You now got a new CMO. What can we expect her to be doing differently? Should we see this as another reset or change of direction? How should we think about that adjustment? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: You're right. Last year, we did a lot of changes. But looking at the result, I think many of the changes was absolutely right, all the way from our structural changes to go-to-market, the product. And also, we did quite a lot of management changes, getting the -- many of the executives in new positions, including then recruiting a new CMO, Leslie Berland. We're excited to have her on. I think where we are with our brand and with our offerings, we're in a great place. But you know you cannot sit still here and that's why we recruited Leslie. Leslie will work with the full team to see how we continue to refine the leadership in the brand, because we are the number one brand in the market. We're just going to refine that, but we're not going to sit still. So, I think Leslie has been here for two weeks. So, I see a lot of great initiatives and ideas, and we will work together with her to make this company even better.\nFrank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Frank. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple if I could. Just the first, you went out of your way to highlight how well fixed wireless access is doing in the C-Band markets. These are kind of the main markets, probably the densest markets. Obviously, we're going to see the C-Band deployment expand, both in terms of spectrum density and in terms of geography. 350,000 has been kind of the baseline expectation for fixed wireless access adds. In the current C-Band deployment, would you be willing to put a stake in the ground? Where could that go? Could that double by the time we get the full C-Band out there by the end of next year? That's the first question. And I guess the second question, Tony, you gave us the kind of moving parts, the EBITDA growth, 2%, that's about $0.75 billion after tax, interest expense at $0.175, that's about $3 billion -- $0.75 billion after tax, $1.5 billion CapEx savings. So, the big moving part that none of us really know is the cash tax and how that might impact free cash flow, whether free cash flow could be up a little bit, down a little bit. Could you be more transparent around that moving part? Thank you so much.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, David. When it comes to fixed wireless access, yeah, when we got the C-Band, the initial chunk of spectrum we got was in urban places. Now, since the end of third quarter, we got the suburban and rural areas. But we continue at the end of the year to strengthen our urban areas. So, now we are sort of deploying much more in the suburban and rural. That creates a new opportunity for us, both from our strength in wireless in many of those markets together with our fixed wireless access. But I said it many times before, for us, it's very important to have a certain volume and a certain cadence, because we can optimize our resources, our capital, et cetera. So, Tony and I feel really good about being around 400,000 net adds for broadband in total, including Fios. That has sort of been a mantra. They can be, of course, coming up and down a little bit. But it's not like we are forcing a lot of capital and resources in the quarter and then doing less, that's not efficient in a company like ours. We are very financially disciplined, as you know, and that's best for our customers and for our stakeholders like shareholders. So, that's what you're going to expect from us.\nTony Skiadas: And Dave, just on your question on cash taxes, so we said, we're going to be pressured by the phaseout of bonus. We did see a tax benefit in 2023 from the spectrum clearing payments. And if you think about the headwind, we'd see it at about $2 billion right now, and we'll have to see how things play out with what the proposed legislation is.\nDavid Barden: Perfect. Helpful, guys. Thank you so much.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Dave. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nCraig Moffett: Yes, hi. I wonder if you could talk about your market growth expectations for postpaid coming into the year. I know you're the first one to report, so we haven't seen the results from anyone else yet. But what's your sense of what we can expect in terms of total postpaid and maybe total phone growth for 2024 market-wide?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. If I think about this year, I mean, first of all, well, mobility and broadband is two of the most important infrastructure in the country, and I don't think anyone, a company, a person or organization can live without those services. We are the number one in basically everything we're doing. I think it's a healthy industry. It's an important product we have, then it can come up and down. So, I cannot give you a percentage what's going to happen. I think our offering is great. I think the product is so important, both mobility and broadband for all parts of our society. I wouldn't like to be in any other business, and it's sort of so important for our society that mobility and broadband is working.\nCraig Moffett: Can I just maybe drill down a little bit though? I mean, the growth numbers we've seen have been as high as 6 million-plus. Is that a feasible growth rate? Population growth, including immigration, is more like 3 million. Is your sense as you go into set your own expectations for the year that we'll see some deceleration? Or is your sense that there's still something going on that's keeping growth so far in excess of population growth?\nHans Vestberg: I think that we're going to -- whatever number it's going to be, we're going to get our fair share of it and that's what we are aiming for. But you're right, of course, immigration is lower, so the pool is smaller, but we've also seen a really good uptake between value segment to postpaid. So, there's a lot of factors coming in. And then of course, what we have done, when I think about offerings, we have myPlan. We're adding the perks, for example, the Netflix and Max. We are expanding also ARPA because we have such a great offering to our customers. So, this is a new time. But again, the product is so important for the market and for each and every one of us. So, I feel really good about coming into this year, what we have done and where we have got, and let's see where we end up.\nCraig Moffett: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Craig. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So maybe a couple. I guess, firstly, on the fiber side, Hans, as you think about the base of fixed wireless subscribers, by next year, you'll have a pretty big critical mass overall of 5 million-plus potentially. And it's not too far away from where your Fios base is. And you have BEAD money coming in. Potentially there's more interest from private equity funds and so on and so forth. And I know you've talked about being a lot more disciplined on fiber, but does your breakeven threshold change just given the kind of critical mass you get to in fixed wireless and also the kind of capital alternatives that we are starting to see in the market? That's one. And secondly, on the wireless side, over the last two or three years, I mean, obviously there's been pretty big tailwind to service revenue from prices and explicit price increases. So, your thoughts on how long that can continue and when does mix take over and become a bigger component overall from a service revenue growth perspective, and how we should expect that transition to happen would be helpful. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Kannan. I have to go back a little bit when it comes to our broadband strategy. We have a multipurpose network. We're building networks once and we have multiple options at the edge. That was sort of the infancy of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. From the data center to the edge, we have harmonized everything, we have fiber in between everything, we have multi-routers, we have one transport network, that is super important. It's sort of the brain of the network. Then, at the edge, we have optionality, what type of access we have. In the ILEC, of course, we're going to continue with our success in Fios, and outside we're doing fixed wireless access. But it gave us optionality over time. I like owner's economics. I think that, that makes us very competitive in pricing and offerings to our customers. There are, of course, a lot offerings from people that want to ship in capital, but ultimately, it has paid off for us to be very, very prudent in financial discipline with our own money. But you can never out-rule, but that's really my view on it. But I'm creating optionality with the network, and Joe and his team are super agile if we need to be within that. On the wireless, I would say, I mean, if you look at our Business side, they have great offerings in the market. They have taken the fair share over 10 quarters, and then have also made new offerings so they can expand. So, I think they both have done quantity and value. And wireless, of course, on the Consumer side, they have historically had more ARPA increase with new offerings, new pricing, new products rather than volumes, but you have seen us performing in the last part of the year. And I think Sampath and his team, they have said that they want to increase their part of getting new customers. But again, it will be financial discipline, and we should get the right customers. And if you look at our quality of our consumer base, it's just amazing, and we will continue to be financially prudent on that, but clearly, we want to have more volumes, and -- but not to any cost. We will do it with the right cost and the right product to our customers.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Kannan. Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Sir, please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Supino: Hi, thanks. Good morning. On the subject of consumption and network utilization, I wondered if you could update us on the number of gigabytes per month that postpaid phone customers are consuming nowadays. And extending that thought over the next few years, does that growth and the robust FWA business that you're building suggest that we should prepare for densification or other radio access network or spectrum costs for capacity over the next several years, certainly not a 2024 question? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. I'll come back to how we build the network, because building the network is so important, because the biggest challenge with a lot of traffic is, of course, transporting it in efficient way, having your own fiber, and that we've already built. When it comes to the growth in the network, yeah, everybody is using the network more. There's no difference between fixed wireless access and Fios. And of course, wireless consumers are using the network more as well. But we have built a very stable network all the way from the data centers to the edge. And then, of course, we have assets that nobody else have. We have a lot of our traffic on millimeter wave, which is the cheapest way to deliver data in the market by far. And we have our C-Band years coming out, so -- and we have our best engineers. So, I feel really good with that people and customers are using our network more. That's what this was intended for, and we have designed it like that. So...\nPeter Supino: Great. Thanks, Peter.\nBrady Connor: Hey, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I had two, if I could. First, following up on John's earlier question, can you give us a sense for how much of the year-over-year improvement in gross adds in the fourth quarter was the result of healthy industry volumes versus the improved execution and product that you've got in the market now? And, additionally on that, did you see stronger performance in December versus the rest of the quarter? I ask because I think your last public presentation was in early December and your results seemed even more positive than your tone back then. So, it seems like maybe you picked up momentum as the quarter progressed. And then, I just had a separate question on the issue of lead cables. I was wondering if you would comment on the latest media report that the EPA has conducted its own testing near some of your lead sheath cables that have shown lead levels above the EPA standard for safety. Any sense for whether these reports are accurate? And if so, how you're thinking about the potential impact at this point around this issue? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Yeah. Thank you, Bryan. Let me start with the market in the fourth quarter. We don't know. I mean, the others haven't reported. We only know that we have performed really well. And -- but that has been -- it's not the one-quarter phenomena. If you think about from the second quarter, third quarter, even in the first quarter, we were sequentially improving all the time, and we have done that in a very disciplined ways with a lot of actions, and that we need to keep up. And then, the comment on how the quarter shaped, so you probably talk about Consumer more than anything else. I think we're solid through the quarter. There was nothing sort of different in -- during the month in the quarter. We were solid through the quarter doing well performance. On the lead, as I said before, we take that very seriously. I cannot comment what media doing. We work with all the agencies to see that we are following this up and we have revealed all the information we have, so we don't have any more. We have also disclosed how much lead cable we have in the network, which is very little. But again, we take it serious and work with all the agencies.\nBryan Kraft: Okay. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Bryan. Hey, Brad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open, sir.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Hey, Hans, this is -- I apologize, probably the fourth time you're coming back to the gross add question. But I think earlier you made mention of kind of the change in structure from nationalization to localization. I think that was something that Sampath has had kind of stated as one of his specific things and probably something that maybe could be more sustainable than just a change in a rate plan that obviously could be replicated or just addresses the market. So, just a couple of questions on that. First, if you think about kind of the ramp in fourth quarter, I know this is kind of a soft question, but like the impact of localization and that change in the structure of the sales organization versus myPlan, which had a larger impact? And then, I guess more importantly, the sustainability, meaning that, yeah, you typically do see sequential growth seasonally around this time of year, obviously more pronounced this year than past, but are we going to see even more sequential growth or more abnormal growth in the first half of the year as some of the implementation of that localization continues, or have we largely already seen that impact as we go into 2024? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Hey, Walt, I think that was -- it's a good question. So, the whole -- we started -- remember, we started with the network. As the C-Band, it's sort of rolling out in different ZIP codes all the time, we are engaging locally. The same we did with the Consumer group to be much more local, to be able to do local marketing, cater for what the local market, have local flavors of our marketing. We worked with the sports league like NFL and the teams in different markets to see that happen. So, of course, I'm going to attribute part of our growth during the year to the decentralization. But we just got started to see that we have that team in place, and Sampat and the team are working with them with these market precedents to make it. But it's also a sign of where the market is going. You need to be local and you need to be on the ground in the different societies in order to perform and be acknowledged, and Verizon is most visible in all the grounds, and now we're taking next step with our structure. So, very pleased with what I've seen so far, but more to be done.\nTony Skiadas: Yeah, Walt, just to add on to what Hans said, the regional structure is a lot closer to the customer, and we've run the business this way for many, many years. And we can do things like different promos for different markets and local resources, and decision making and the localization offset some of the price ups as well. So, we feel really good about where we're heading, especially with the Tier 2 and Tier 3 rollouts with C-Band and the opportunity that provides.\nWalter Piecyk: Tony, can you also remind us when the Board considers share repurchase as it relates to leverage? And I think the leverage that you mentioned earlier in the call, excludes the unsecured debt, because you were referencing a 2.6 number. So, assuming we're basing it off the 2.6 number, I think your long-term target was 2.0 times. So, clearly, you wouldn't let it go below 2.0 times before you start buying stock back. But is there a consideration under 2.5 times where the Board starts to consider share repurchase? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Walt. I think this is something that we have been very disciplined. Our capital allocation priorities are clear. Number one, money to the business, basically our CapEx. Number two, continue to put the Board in a place where they can continue to increase our dividend. And number three, paying down debt. When we come down to 2.25 times, we have said we will start considering buybacks, but our ultimate long-term goal is to get around 2 times. So, yeah, that's the plan. But of course, it will play in where the market is, where the interest rates are, where the capital, and where the equities. But clearly, that's the plan we have right now and the Board is fully tuned to that plan.\nWalter Piecyk: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Walt. Brad, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website, a detailed review of our third quarter results. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and good morning, to everyone. I am pleased to share our strong third quarter results making out the quarter with solid growth and improving profitability. It is clear that our strategy is working. In both the consumer and the business groups we are executing a segmented agile strategy that provides value to our customers and our bottom-line.  We have delivered growth in each of areas where on, wireless service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. This is evidence that we have the right strategy and are achieving our results in a financially disciplined way.  Now let me share our financials for the quarter. For the third quarter, wireless service revenue is up 3.9% year-over-year, driven by expanding and deepening our customer relationships. This revenue growth is a key driver for adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion for the quarter which is higher than both Q3 last year and sequentially.  Our year to-date free cash flow of $14.6 billion is already exceeding our full year free cash flow for 2022. Thanks to our focus on high quality revenue growth, disciplined promotion strategy, cost efficiency and CapEx reduction of the recent years of heightened capital-intensity driven by the C-band, and fiber investments.  I'm proud to share that my team and I have taken actions to further our position our financial strengths. Our strong cash generation enabled us to reduce net debt, strengthen our balance sheet, and deliver a higher dividend to our shareholders. We're working to bring our leverage ratio to the pre-Spectrum acquisition levels.  During the third quarter, we paid down $2.6 billion in debt and increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. A current industry record that we take pride in. Our dividend coverage is very healthy. Year to-date our free cash flow dividend payout ratio is approximately 56%, a significant improvement from a year ago.  In summary, in spite of an uncertain economic environment, we are on pace to finish 2023 strong. We are confident that we will deliver on the financial guidance that we issued to you at the start of the year and this morning are announcing higher free cash flow guidance for 2023. Tony will provide you more details in the few moments.  Now, let me share more on how our business units are driving our strategy forward. In the quarter, we delivered on our key growth areas, mobility, broadband and private networks. Thanks to our networks, scale and technology advantages.  In consumer mobility, we achieved sequential and year year-over-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds by continuing to put the customer at the center everything we do rather than engaging in aggressive promotional activity like others in the industry, we're offering our consumers optionality and flexibility to choose how they want to use our products and services.  Our differentiated approach or segmentation, financial discipline is paying off with growth in postpaid phone growth adds and lower promotional cash costs. There is more work to be done, but our responsible approach position us to grow subscribers profitably. Since its launch in May, myPlan continues to deliver a personalized experience, giving our customers the value, choice and control that they want.  During the third quarter,we enhanced myPlan by adding Ultimate Unlimited, a third tier with more value and services, further increasing our premium mix and ARPA growth. This is just one example of the flexibility and speed to market that myPlan provides. And I'm excited about what is to come. Our targeted and segmented market approach also serves as well during the iPhone 15 launch and we continue to execute with an iTunes meeting our customers\u2019 needs while maintaining a disciplined approach.  Our competitive position is now stronger. And we\u2019ve delivered positive consumer postpaid phone net adds in the month of September. We anticipate that momentum will continue as we are on track to exceed our postpaid phone net adds from Q4 of last year.  Postpaid phone shown levels are stable even with our targeted pricing actions throughout the year. We continue to see muted upgrade levels, which is something we are watching carefully and is a trend we expect will continue for the next few quarters.  Turning to business mobility. Verizon Business Group delivered 151,000, phone net ads and reached our ninth consecutive quarter above 125,000. Business in governments continue place an increased emphasis on best-in-class reliable connectivity that only Verizon provides. Across mobility, postpaid phone net adds were 100,000, compared to 8,000 last year. We have the largest customer base in the industry and are still finding new ways to add customers through innovation, service quality and a variety of offerings and partnerships that competitors cannot match.  As we discussed before, we\u2019re seeking the optimal balance between price and quantity that allow us to grow our base profitability. In our value business we have had negative volumes, but I'm encouraged by our quarter-over-quarter improvements. As I\u2019ve said before, the value business is a key part of our growth strategy, and we will continue to invest in it and adjust to the needs of the markets.  As we mentioned last quarter, we believe we're seeing the bottom for prepaid volumes and the team is committed and working daily to grow our value business.  Moving to broadband, we delivered another strong quarter with more than 400,000 new subscribers for the fourth quarter in a row. We finished Q3 with $10.3 million broadband subscribers, up by more than 1.7 million subscribers from a year ago, a 21% increase. Critical to the strengths of this key area is fixed wireless access, something you know we deeply believe in.  Our fixed wireless access net adds of 384,000 continue to be strong even with a recent $10 increase for new bundled customers, further evidence of the demand for our product. Where FWA is available, our customers take it and loving it as seen by the high net promoter score. I'm excited towards the share that on the Fios side we had 72,000 Internet net adds for the quarter, up, almost 20% year-over-year and one or best performances in seven years.  Fios remains a coveted, high quality service and we continue to take share and deliver strong numbers even in a lower mover environment. When it comes to private networks, we demand for the product continue to grow, especially those solutions built with licensed spectrum, which provides a more secure and differentiated experience for the end-users.  Businesses are increasingly looking to us for the private network solutions helping to grow our sales funnel and scale the number of installations each quarter.  Let me end by talking about the backbone of our business, our network. During the third quarter, we obtained early access to our remaining C-band spectrum. In urban markets, where C-band is already deployed, we're firing on all cylinders and leveraging its full potential through software upgrades, delivering two to three times more spectrum depth.  As a result, peak speeds go from 9 megabits per second to an amazing 2.4 gigabits per second enabling an even better experience for our customers. You\u2019ve heard me say this before, but let me say it again. C-Band is a game change for our business, giving us better customer attention and step up, as well as a strong broadband opportunity with fixed wireless access.  Every day we see the benefits of our generation investment in C-band spectrum and the impact it will have for our customers for years to come. And our network is winning. This quarter, we received J.D. Power awards in all six US regions, receiving the most awards for wireless network quality for the 31st time in a row.  We have the best networks in the market and we will extend our lead as we complete our C-band deployment, first augmenting urban areas, and next year in suburban and rural markets. This is our key differentiator and the center of everything we do. And we're doing all of this in a responsible way. We're optimizing our network while returning to business as usual levels of CapEx.  We're finding cost efficiencies across our business both as a result of our a new structure, and by emphasizing profitability, when evaluating new opportunities like within business wireline. Our cost efficiency program remains on track to meet our savings goal of $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2025.  Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial and operational performance in more detail. \nTony Skiadas : Thanks, Hans and good morning. Our results for the third quarter continue to demonstrate our progress towards our three priorities, growing wireless service revenue, and driving EBITDA and free cash flow. As Hans said, we are executing on our plan and remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We've talked about improving our operational performance while maintaining financial discipline with the third quarter results representing another proof point that demonstrates we can deliver improving key metrics and strong financials.  Consumer postpaid phone net losses totaled $51,000 for the quarter, an improvement of $85,000, sequentially and $138,000 compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we executed well in a low switcher environment, enabling postpaid phone gross add growth of 2.3% year-over-year. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.85% represents a stable result even after implementing over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023.  Our segmented approach to the market and the structure and discipline of our promotional strategy helped to deliver strong postpaid phone gross adds and lower postpaid upgrades. The third quarter\u2019s consumer upgrade rate of 3.6% is down 150 basis points year-over-year. The quality of the business we are writing in consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive an elevated premium mix.  Consumer ARPA of $133.47 increased sequentially by 1.2% and year-over-year by 4.5%. We expect to deliver further ARPA growth as a result of the innovations of myPlan, as well as our most recent pricing actions. Verizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 151,000 phone net adds, which as Hans mentioned is our ninth consecutive quarter above 125,000.  While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and businesses are more cautious than a year ago, mobility continues to be a top investment priority for our Business customers. We expect to continue to deliver strong volumes and expand their relationships by leveraging our position as the wireless market share leader for small and medium businesses, large enterprises and public sector customers.  Moving on to broadband, we delivered 434,000 net additions continuing the pace of over 400,000 net adds for the fourth quarter in a row. Customers are drawn to the quality of our service and overall value proposition for both FWA and Fios. For fixed wireless, gross add expansions grew 384,00 net adds for the quarter growing the base to nearly 2.7 million subscribers.  The addition of the second tranche of C-band spectrum will help us continue our FWA momentum as we work to build a long-term sustainable business. Fios Internet net adds were 72,000, up 11,000 year-over-year.  We are pleased with the success of FiOS with strong gross adds and retention reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. For prepaid, net loss is up $207,000 represents the sequential improvement from the second quarter. We expected a better trajectory for the remainder of the year, as the teams continue to scale some of our key brands such as Visible, and Total by Verizon and execute on our ongoing integration efforts.  Let's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $33.3 billion, down 2.6% year-over-year. The decline can be attributed to wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 12% lower than the prior year as postpaid upgrades declined 26%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.3 billion, up 2.9% year-over-year and up $217 million sequentially.  Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans and growth and fixed wireless access.  Additionally, as a result of our discipline around promotions and lower upgrade volumes, we saw further reduction in headwinds to service revenue growth associated with promo amortization. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduce total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 60 basis points year-over-year.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12.2 billion, an increase of $267 million sequentially and up 0.2%, compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by improved wireless service revenue and lower consumer postpaid upgrades. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily due to the lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes.  While bad debt is up year-over-year, it was once again flat sequentially consistent with the first half of the year. We continue to make progress on our cost efficiency program, having recently implemented transformations within our consumer, customer care group, as well as business manage services. We are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings in 2023 building momentum to generate incremental savings in 2024.  Adjusted EPS was $1.22 and includes $0.03of pressure from a reduction in capitalized interest due to the early clearance of C-band spectrum. We currently anticipate another incremental $0.03 to $0.04 in the fourth quarter.  Turning the attention to cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter was $10.8 billion, bringing the 2023 year-to-date total to $28.8 billion. The year-to-date performance is up approximately $600 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to working capital improvements associated with fewer upgrades and lower inventory levels partially offset by higher interest payments.  Customer payments continue to be healthy with consistent performance throughout the year. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, totaling $14.2 billion year-to-date. At this point, we expect 2023 CapEx to come in at the upper end of our guidance range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion.  The third quarter was a second consecutive quarter operating at our business as usual runrate. As a result, we would expect a reduction of approximately $4 billion of CapEx in 2023, compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $6.7 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $14.6 billion, a $2.2 billion improvement over the prior year.  As Hans mentioned, we have generated more free cash flow in the first three quarters of this year than in all of 2022. Based on our year-to-date results and the strength of our core business, we are pleased to raise our 2023 free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to more than $18 billion. We are raising guidance even with CapEd at the upper end of our range and absorbing the headwinds from interest expense.  Strong free cash flow provides flexibility and enables us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. As Hans said, within the third quarter, we executed a successful $2.6 billion debt tender, of which a majority was floating rate, while also increasing our dividend once again. Additionally, given our cash position and the performance of the business, this month we paid approximately $3.7 billion of spectrum clearing cost, primarily using operating cash flow. The remaining spectrum payments are minimal and will be made in 2024.  Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $122.2 billion, an improvement of $4.3 billion from the end of second quarter, and $7.1 billion lower year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash on hand, which we are using to pay the clearing cost I just described. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the third quarter, representing a 0.1, churn improvement year-over-year.  Overall, I'm pleased with our ability to deliver stronger operational and financial trends. We are focused on finishing the year strong with continued improvements in volumes and financials, setting us up for meaningful deleveraging opportunities in 2024.  I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. I'm proud of the progress our team has made and our operating results over the last three quarters should also give you confidence in us. We're delivering on our financial targets ahead of schedule on several key metrics and are restoring our leverage ratios to where we want them to be. We have a great network and our free cash flow generation is industry leading and we have more than 10 million broadband subscribers and that number is growing at near record rates.  As we enter the final quarter of 2023, our goals are clear; deliver strong growth in wireless service revenue; EBITDA and free cash flow. Our segmented and disciplined approach to consumer mobility is working and we expect our momentum to continue building in the fourth quarter. Enabling all of this is America's best and most reliable 5G networks. Or C-band spectrum has already benefited mobility and broadband.  Deploying the remaining C-band will make this network even stronger and more resilient and I'm excited about the opportunities that lies ahead.  Let me close with this. Our performance has put us firmly on track to meet our full year financial targets and position us well as we approach 2024. We're excited to head into 2024 with all of our assets in place and a great team to execute our strategy.  With that, I hand the call back to Brady for questions. \nBrady Connor: Thanks, Hans. Brad, we are ready to take questions this morning. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]  And the first question for today will come from Phil Cusick of JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Hi guys. Thank you. Two if I can. Tony, how should we think about the pieces of free cash flow growing our stability next year? And after making the C-band relocation payments, what obligations other than the dividend will prevent you from delivering? And then Hans as a follow-up, there's a lot of speculation about M&A in the fiber and wireless spaces lately. Can you talk about any interest you have in buying fiber or wireless assets in the market? And if so, what might be criteria for that? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg : I will start and I hand it over to Tony. I mean, first on the cash flow, I think you have seen us now the last couple of years are focusing very much on our service revenue expansion, EBITDA and cash flow expansion and all our incentives for the management deceptive from the Board, both short and long term. So this is a key thing for us to see that we are continuing to generate a lot of cash flow. Tony will take \u2013 talk to the puts and takes.  Regarding fiber adds, and first of all I love our strategy. I mean our strategy was clear from 2017. In the Fios footprint of course we build a lot of fiber doing extremely well. You saw this quarter again a record quarter of Fios subscribers. Outside we build one fiber over a couple of years. We're basically in all the major markets. We have one fiber to our own network.  Right now, our strategy is clear that we want to take the broadband subscribers with fixed lines access because we get them right now. It's a superior product and we don't see a need right now for adding any fiber to that footprint. Over time, of course, we will always look into it and anyone that would dispose any telecommunication assets, any market will talk to us, but the total is high. I mean, we have a great network and we have built a really good strategy around our technology. \nTony Skiadas : Hi Phil. Good morning. So on the cash generation, so we're very pleased thus far. I'll start with where we are in the third quarter. So we're pleased with the cash generation of the business. The performance of the business, and as you saw the continued discipline that we had with promos and retention gave us the confidence to raise the free cash flow guide by $1 billion to more than $18 billion. And that's with CapEx at the upper end of the range and also with higher interest expense.  So we feel very good about the balance of the year and are positioning heading into next year. Obviously, we're not going to guide on 2024 at this time, but I can share some qualitative aspects as we look ahead to free cash flow for 2024. On the plus side, we continue to focus the team on an improving EBITDA profile and that's a big focus of the team.  With respect to CapEx, we said a couple of times here in the past that we expect to run at $17 billion to $17.5 billion for 2024, which is back to a business as usual level of spend that you've seen from us. And then we also strive to make continued improvements in working capital. And then offsetting that, we expect higher interest costs from both in the rate environment and the reduction in capitalized interest due to the early clearing of the C-band spectrum.  And then with taxes, as you know, under current legislation, taxes are going to be pressured by the continued phase out of bonus depreciation and we'll see how that plays out. And, so heading into 2024, we continue to focus on strong free cash flow generation and opportunities for meaningful debt reduction. And we don't see any obstacles of Delevering.  Thanks. Okay guys. \nBrady Connor: Yeah, great. Thanks. Thanks Phil, Brad. We're ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Hans, you talked a lot about fixed wireless. You've got the rest of the C-band. Can you help update the fixed wireless footprint? The open for sale and where you are today? And how you get to the $50 million households or any updated target that you have there?  And then, Tony, you talked a little bit about some of the pricing actions you've taken so far. Can you just cheese out for us what you've recognized in Q3? And what I think you've talked about a tailwind when going into Q4. So, how we think about some of the, the kind of sequential benefits that are still to come? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg : Simon, I can start with fixed wireless access. As you can see, we continue on that rhythm with the 354, 000 every quarter. The additional C-band we got, used a couple of weeks ago we initially go straight to augmenting our urban areas. We\u2019ve already had the sites and then in the early part of next year, we will also start deploying that in suburban and rural areas.  And of course, that's an even greater opportunity for us because there are more underserved markets and our fixed wireless actually come extremely quickly into those markets. So that's will just fortify our situation and how we want to roll this out. We have a target of $4 million to $5 million subscribers by 2025. We keep that of course, we have dimension on network for way more and the team, of course, have a have the internal targets that were set by me. But right now, there's nothing else that we want to deliver this target as well to the market. We always want to deliver what we tell the market and we're going to do that. And then we have a conversation about that when we've passed it. \nTony Skiadas : And Simon, on the - on your question on pricing. So a few things here. We executed a number of pricing actions as you saw. The legacy mix and match that we did earlier in September will yield about a $100 million of incremental benefit in the in the fourth quarter and we also see improving volumes on mobility and year-over-year improvements there. And we also see a an increasing contribution for fixed wireless access. You saw the growth we had in the quarter with 384,000 net adds. We have 2.7, almost 2.7 million subs in our base. So we feel very good about the momentum there. So, very good progress on service revenue and setting us up well for next year. \nSimon Flannery: Right. Thanks a lot. \nBrady Connor: Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open sir. \nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Just two questions. First on the upgrades. Obviously, that number continued to come down or solidly into this sort of 3% range. I mean, Hans, in you're prepared remarks you sort of suggested that you expect to see the same for the next few quarters. I guess, two questions there.  First of all, what in your view, what is really driving it? And do you think that this is a temporary issue or and that, it'll go back to some sort of normalized rate? And then, any comments on what that low rate is really doing to your business?  And then, secondly, in the past, you guys have given some numbers, and some metrics on what the C-band is doing for your business as it gets rolled out. Any update there? Are you still seeing improvement in things like gross adds, ARPU, Churn as you roll C-band out? Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Thanks, John. on the upgrade, as we're seeing now for a couple of quarters, when we started our segmented approach on the consumer side, where we actually tried to meet our customers in different segments with the right offerings. That of course, have driven a lower upgrade rate. But as we are not doing a peanut butter spread sort of that everybody gets everything.  So we're really trying to see that we have the right offer for our customer and what is giving me confidence is that our gross adds just continued to grow for us. So we have the right offering in the market together with myPlan. Of course, fourth quarter is always a little bit higher on upgrades because that's normally a seasonality.  But in general, I see that our model is working and this is both helping our customers with the right offerings. But not only that is helping us with the bottom-line and the cash flow generation that we're very focused here at Verizon. And then on the C-band, we see the same things as we have discussed before. We see lower churn where we deploy C-band.  We see better step ups in those regions. And then on top of it, we increased fixed wireless access. So there's no difference on that. So I think we \u2013 same, same and that's why we're so excited by C-band continue to roll out and I have gotten hold of old C-band here, just a couple of weeks ago. \nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Hans. \nBrady Connor : Brad we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. \nBrett Feldman: Thanks, for taking the question. Coming back to service revenue growth is we're looking ahead into next year and maybe digging a little bit into ARPU drivers, I know you don't report postpaid, phone ARPU, but it's clearly an important component of what drives your ARPA. And I was hoping you could give us some insight into how you're thinking about those drivers next year?  So for example, are you still - you still see opportunity to make further pricing adjustments in the base? Could you maybe give us some insight into what the mix is looking like? And are you continuing to see the highest tiered plans being among the most popular? And then, are there any headwinds that might be emerging in the ARPU dynamic we need to be taking account for? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg : So, let me start on the high level. I mean, first of all, we need to think about our total offering on wireless and we haven't spoken so far much about the business side, but the business side again for the ninth quarter in a row had more than 125,000 phone net adds, actually 150 plus. So they are doing good in a market where our customers on that side, is really looking on the performance of the network and the high quality distribution we have. So I'm very pleased with that and I have - I would like to say it.  On the consumer side, I think we have found a model with myPlan and how we go to market. All the changes that consumer group and Samper have done since earlier, this year with the plans to decentralization, sales incentives, is helping us to be in the right proposition. Then we always look to order new value add that we can give to our customers to broaden the scope for us and for our customers like we did with the third tier on the network side on myPlan or that we took away the discount on the convergence within mobility and fixed wireless access in these quarters.  We will continue to look at it, but it's nothing that is the most important right now because I think we having offering that is really compelling to our customers. \nTony Skiadas : And then, Brett, on the - on your service revenue question, just some qualitative thoughts for you. On the plus side, I would say, look the pricing actions we took this year, obviously have a tailwind in the fourth quarter and carry over into next year. So we continue to see momentum there. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect an improving volume profile in the consumer business. So that's something that the team is very focused on.  Fixed wireless access continues to scale. So, as I mentioned earlier, another 384,000 net adds, even as Hans said, and taking away the discount as well. So the momentum is strong there. And continued increase premium mix with myPlan. So myPlan is seeing roughly 70% premium mix and we're very pleased with the progress there.  And we're also seeing some of the headwinds from the promo amortization starting to ease a little bit, that's starting to flatten out, which is good news. And also a function of all the discipline that we've had this year. And then offsetting that, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, prepaid continues to be a headwind the in the near term as we continue to work to improve the business and that's still ongoing.  So those are the puts and takes in terms of service revenue. \nBrett Feldman: Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open. \nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I'm curious if you can unpack the ways in which Verizon will look to achieve its cost-cutting targets through 2025, as well, as how much of those benefits could come through in 2024 versus 2025? And then just separately on prepaid, just an update would be great on the integration of TracFone? And how Verizon is thinking about the opportunities and timing of potentially taking some of those prepaid customers and migrating them over to your postpaid base. Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Mike. On the cost target, we are definitely on track for delivering on the $2 million to $3 million that we talked about when we launched a new structure. The new structure started this year. The first of January. We see a lot of tractions on it and probably, as you follow us closely, you have seen that we've worked on the managed services side together with HL.  We have done a big transaction on the customer care side. We are doing a lot of transaction on the IT side. We're bringing more AI into the network and to the customer care. It's a lot of things ongoing. So I have a high confidence that we are finding along the road there all the savings we need and the traction is very high in the company on the efficiency given that we have one organization right now, Russian Global Services supporting all others to see that we find the best measurements across the company.  And I can go back to prepaid and maybe Tony has some more comments on the cost side. \nTony Skiadas : Sure. Thanks. And Mike, just a couple of other additional points that Hans mentioned. So, we're on track to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion as Hans said. $200 million to $300 million of that will come this year in 2023 in EBITDA and that was already contemplated in the guide. Hans mentioned a lot of the initiatives. The other item I would mention is we are being very disciplined in business wireline by deemphasizing low margin deals. So that's something that the team is very, very focused on, as well.  We're not going to give cost targets for \u201824 at this time, but we feel good that we have a good foundation that are driving EBITDA improvements and you saw it in the quarter with both sequential and year-over-year improvements in EBITDA that's going to set the foundation for improving EBITDA profile in 2024. \nHans Vestberg : On the value segment, in prepaid and TracFone, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are at the low point to first half of \u201823 and from here on, we should start sequentially improving. Secondly, this is really important for our strategy. We want to build the network once and have as many connections as possible and address the entire market on wireless.  And, of course, being strong and being the number one in the value segment is important. Then from a market point of view, we all know that there has been some sort of blend between the low end on postpaid and prepaid, which means that the volumes in preparation is little bit lower and we have not been part of that transformation or taking customer for prepaid.  So what we're doing right now in our own operation, which is a lot, but one, we're building up Total by Verizon, which is a great speed we have on opening new doors. That's going to help us to move up to postpaid for the customers that want to do that. But also have an high end value proposition.  Secondly, we work with the national retailers that we have to see that we are fortifying our offerings in our store. And finally, you're seeing that feasible continuous with the pace it has. And that we're working with a lot of other things. So it's a lot of ongoing here that gives us confidence that we will sequentially continue to improve. And but clearly, this is very important for our overall strategy. \nMichael Rollins: Thanks. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. \nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I have a question on fixed wireless. There continues to be a lot of debate regarding the sustainability of fixed wireless served by macro as all sites given the trajectory of broadband usage and of course, unit economics of radio access networks versus fiber. So really I guess two questions. One, since you started the fixed wireless deployment, have your assumptions changed at all regarding usage or the number of fixed wireless customers you can ultimately load network with over time?  And secondly, what developments have occurred in millimeter waves delivered fixed wireless this year? And how at this point are you thinking about millimeter wave evolving over the next couple years as a scalable access technology? Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Hi, Bryan. And the first, yeah, our assumption has changed on fixed wireless access because our technology has improved more than we thought from the beginning. That means that we can take on even more capacity. And we're only on the first inning on the software improvements, and our optimization of the network. I think Joe and his team is doing a fantastic job with it.  Customers are using it on the consumer side, equally much as on the Fios. So that there's no different on usage. So I think we have a great path forward with technology and we are not seeing everything we can do still with the fixed wireless access when it comes to software development, radio improvements, et cetera. So I'm - I have no hesitation over the assumption with that made. They are actually having better assumptions today.  When it comes to millimeter wave, that is playing a vital role for us for many reasons. First of all, it takes in all high density areas. They take the majority of the capacity. And that's very important for several reasons. I unleashed a mid-band spectrum in order to have better performance on the street, but also in fixed wireless access.  So millimeter wave will continue to play a very vital role. As we have said several times, we built very few - very quickly in all major places. And now we're sort of augmenting where we see a lot of traffic. On top of that, of course, we see opportunities for using our millimeter wave also for MDUs over the time to see that we address that market with fixed wireless access.  So, all in all, we still have a lot of technology evolution to see that we can serve even more customers with even better performance and more capacity. So, I'm very happy and as you've seen on fixed wireless access, our MPS scores is all out to the shot. I mean the customers loves it. It is easy. It's quick to deploy itself to install. So I think we hit it clearly with this product and we want to push it with our team and see the customer gets the right products. \nBryan Kraft: Thank you Hans. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open. \nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you very much. Quick question. I apologize if this was addressed. Can you quantify how much of the interest expense going from capitalization to the income statement from C-band? And then secondly, where are you as far as being able to utilize the fixed wireless to help reduce cost or type two circuits and that's sort of thing? Thank you. \nHans Vestberg : I can start with the fixed wireless access and Tony will. Yeah, great question. Sometimes we are focused on fixed wireless access being sort of a consumer solution for broadband. Today, we sell a lot of fixed wireless access for - in the business segment as well both for large enterprises and for small and medium customers which has a different usage pattern, which is great.  And also we see and Kyle has discussed that several times. He see also, this is a way of optimizing our access cost by having fixed access as a barrier or transport in many cases. So, clearly again, this is how we build our network from the beginning to be able from the datacenter to the edge of the network have a total harmonized network that can fastly move all the data and then at the edge of the network, we'll have different type of access technologies in order to serve our customers and fixed wireless access can serve many different use cases.  And we, we tend to talk a lot about the consumer fixed wireless access use case. But I have or Kyle have a lot of use cases in the business segment and if you look at the numbers this quarter, he's continuing to add the lot of fixed wireless access customers, as well. \nTony Skiadas : And then, Frank on the on the capitalized interest question, in the quarter, we saw about $0.03 of pressure from capitalized interest from the time we got the licenses. And then, for the fourth quarter, we estimate $0.03 to $0.04 of pressure from capitalized interest. So hope that helps. \nFrank Louthan: All right. Great. Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open. \nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. Just the first one, Hans, at the very beginning of the call, you said that you were being really successful at three things, mobility, broadband, and private networks. And we haven't really heard a lot about what you're doing in private networks. What your goals are, what you're successes has been.  So if you could elaborate a little bit on what that is and why it's one of the big three things that we should care about Verizon being good at it will be super helpful. And then the second is maybe this is for Tony. Just, I think we just touched on a little bit, but the, the success that you guys have been having in the postpaid phone subscriber net adds in business, could you elaborate a little bit on where that's coming from? Like, given that the consumer isn't growing, how is it that the business continues to be so successful quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter and should we assume that that just can continue? Thank you so much. \nHans Vestberg : Thank you, David. On the private networks, yeah, good question. What is happening in the private network right now is that we are doing proof-of-concept to go to commercials. We have ramped up a fantastic funnel. We're starting getting more and more deals every quarter. They start pretty small. They start sort of like a Wi-Fi substitution.  And then, when it works, let's say, you have one big this logistic company. They take the one logistics center then they do it and all. We are in that phase of ramping that up to do in one to many at the moment. What we have done, we've done two things very important. We're cut the lead times of proof-of-concept to actually to commercial deal.  And it's very clear for our customers that the capacity, the security and the low latency is a game changer for them when they see it. And secondly we also now have an ecosystem of products, infrastructure, modem, chipsets, phones and radios that can serve different use cases. So, that's why we're excited over it. We are not going to see any significant revenues that has an impact on Verizon overall in \u201824. We are going to see that in \u201825, but why it's important is that, this is an area we never been into.  This is a total the new time we can address by running private networks for different industries for different large enterprises across the country with our distribution and technology. I see this is a great opportunity to how we use our spectrum. So that's why we pay a lot of attention to it. And with a lot of opportunities coming through it.  And before Tony talks about the business segment, and the wireless, I would say one main reason why we continue to do is our wireless \u2013 our network is the best. I mean, if you ask any of our enterprise customers or SMB customers, the reliability and the performance of our network is just the best. And that's a very important buying criteria in that segment. Tony? \nTony Skiadas : Sure. So, Dave, a couple things. We're pleased again with the strong results from Kyle and the team. We saw a great phone net adds in the quarter, 151,000 and over 430,000 year-to-date. And we saw healthy demand across the board. That would be enterprise public sector and small medium biz. And that performance is in a very uncertain environment and as Hans said, these strong results validate that the businesses continue to trust the Verizon network even during uncertain economic times.  And, we do see certain pressures in certain sectors and we're certainly not immune to it. But we're not seeing anything significant and from a competitive standpoint, I would tell you that we're being very disciplined and we're not going to chase the bad deals that are that are better unprofitable.  The other thing I would mention is FWA volumes also continue at a strong pace and in business. And we had a hundred and 132,000 net adds in the third quarter and over 400,000 year-to-date. So we have great momentum heading into the fourth quarter here and as we set up for next year. \nDavid Barden: And if I could just one more and I apologize. Thank you, Tony. So Hans, it's been six months since the team kind of got reset and you put all the people to work. The results seem to be moving in the right direction. Are you - how happy are you with the choices you made right now? \nHans Vestberg : I'm very happy with the choices. I think, as always, when you make a change and we did quite a big change. And I think six out of the eight seats in the leadership team changed in one swoop. I think we had good alignment from the first week. What we need to do, all the way from Kyle, Tony and Sam, Pat which was very important and Joe which is sort of the four operational units. And you can see the results right now. I mean the guys are executing extremely well.  So I'm happy with it. I want to push them even harder but these guys are really good. They take hard pressure and they deliver on it. So, I'm happy on the choices and the team is doing well. \nDavid Barden: Great. Thanks guys. \nBrady Connor : Brad, we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. \nCraig Moffett : Hi, thank you. Maybe starting with Tony, Tony can you talk about what contribution you're getting from your wholesale wireless revenue that the cable industry scales? And then, could you talk about what benefits that's having in terms of margin accretion and what have you? And then, I wonder if you just - how we should think about potential risk to that revenue stream as ComCast and Charter start to roll out strand on the small cells to potentially offload more of that traffic onto their own networks. \nTony Skiadas : Okay. So a few things here. So as, you know, we can't discuss the particular economics of any commercial deal and that includes the commercial deals we have with the cable companies. What I can tell you is that, we are very happy with the MB&O agreements and those agreements are accretive. It's important business for us and as Hans said many times it\u2019s consistent with our strategy to monetize the network. It's very profitable business for us.  It's growing and we're very comfortable with the arrangement. But that's as far as we'll go. \nBrady Connor : All right. Thanks Craig. Brad we're ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open sir. \nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So maybe Hans, you in terms of fixed wireless business, when you think about the capacity that you have with C-band and you've talked a couple of times about momentum heading into next year, as you expand into other footprints, is there any kind of a goal post that you have in terms of the kind of growth here - growth aspirations that you have to balance it with a capacity use that the network may have. So the 350, 400, kind of a number, does it go to 500 or is there some kind of a framework you guys are thinking about in terms of your aspiration there? Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Thanks, Kannan. I think on the fixed wireless access we have said a couple of times that we like they read them on 400,000 per quarter, because it's putting our sort of our operations in the right model or deploying this. And as we have also decentralized or regionalized our go to market, we can work with the markets where we actually open for sale fixed-wireless access, work with the local community, work with the local government and also address it through our stores.  We can focus our efforts in that region and see that we capture all the demand and the funnel we have there. So, we think it's a good model that we have right now and that's also there's some loss of physics how quickly we can roll out the C-band. But I can tell you there's no one holding back any investments here in order to get the C-band to our customers as soon as possible.  So, I think, we will continue to look at that and that. I mean, that type of levels going forward, as well. And that will help us with reaching any goalpost we have or whatever goalpost we have communicated to the market. \nKannan Venkateshwar: Great. Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Brad we are ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Williams of TD Cowen. Your line is open. \nGreg Williams : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, Hans you mentioned the improving KPIs when you launch C-band in the markets similar to last quarter, as well. Just thinking, should we see churn improvements from here as the C-band sort of maturates this markets or every sort of optimal levels? And then second on just on media reports suggesting that you are hiring suggesting seriously in the wire line side and I'm just thinking about your fiber-to-the-home builds maybe it's not on the M&A side. You said it's high hurdle that's on your organic side if you would bring up your builds or even the beta opportunity there. Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : Okay. On the, KPIs, you are correct and we rollout the C-bandwidth we have better retention and better step-ups. And of course, we also expect that we can take share. I think in the consumer side and the business in both sides, we see opportunities as we come with the fixed files access to this market and with the C-band. So there is share gains. We are planning to do here and our teams are very focused on it going forward.  The second question was around fiber. In our ILEC, I guess and we're not holding back on that. I mean, first of all, you saw how great we're doing this quarter with Fios. We'll continue to invest in Fios and see we have our customers. Outside the Fios, our primary strategy is to build on a One Fiber and the fix wireless access to capture the market before anybody else is even the remotely there. That's what we do.  Then over time, as I said hundred times, I got to have optionality if I would have another access technology over time. But that's not in the chords right now. We have all the capacity and the technology out in the fields right now and the quicker we can come out, the quicker we can meet the demand that\u2019s out there and meeting the customer that wants our broadband, which is a lot of them. \nGreg Williams : Got it. Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Hey Brad, we have time for one more question, please. \nOperator: Your last question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. \nTim Horan: Thanks, guys. Hans, stepping back a second, can you talk about the ability for yourselves and industry demand of how all the investments in the last few years both accelerating growth in free cash flow, how important is pricing here because inflations were only 4%, GDP is growing about 5%, inflation is probably above 4% again next year or we are not really seeing much revenue growth. So, what you think needs to be done for the industry to kind of monetize all the investments? Thanks. \nHans Vestberg : I can talk for ourselves. I think we are in a moment where we actually are monetizing by being very segmented both in our business side and in our consumer side. And that both having the right offers for our customers at the same time we are again raising bottom-line for ourselves. So, I think that\u2019s where we are and we have done some price adjustments but that has also included new values for our customers. I think we now are coming to a moment where we are probably going to have a little bit more on quantities not only price given the track that we have in our business right now.  So we're going to balance that out doing the right for our customers, but also doing right for our shareholders. And then, we are of course adding that with our broadband growth which is also helping us. And then, as Tony said, we are taking out cost at the same time. So that's how we work. And that's why we can lift the free cash flow for this year. The guidance even though we're on the high end on our CapEx guidance, as well as higher or headwinds from the interest rate.  So that tells you a little bit how we feel about the business. How we now have the right propositions in a market and we can sort of retooling that if something happen. But right now, we feel confident about the model we have. \nTim Horan: And related to that, I know you want to get that EBITDA back to pre-auction levels. Do you have a kind of a time frame on that and just remind us what - how do you do that? \nHans Vestberg : Yeah. So what we have said before was that we want to come to a ratio of 2.25 over the net debt to EBITDA and we are going to continue to work our way down and that is a primary goal for us. Number one in the capital allocation is to invest in our business. Number two is continue to put our board in a position so they can increase our dividend. We are on 17 years of consecutive increases and thirdly we're paying down our debts. When we come to that ratio, we will start having a conversation about buybacks.  But we want to do buybacks not that one-off or something. It has to be a consecutive program all the time. So, but we're not there yet. But the team is doing great job. Tony talked about the 2.6 billion they we reduced debt this quarter with the tenders were down. So we will continue to do that with the cash flow. That's where we are yielding right now. \nTim Horan: Thank you. \nBrady Connor : Yeah, thanks, Tim. Brad, before we end the call, I want to turn it back over to Hans for a few closing statements here. \nHans Vestberg : Before we close, I want to take a moment to address the humanitarian crisis in Israel and Palestine. That has continued to escalate over the past few weeks. At Verizon we stand against terrorism in all its forms and condemn the violence that has claimed the lives of so many innocent civilians. The Verizon Foundation has committed a $2 million donation to organizations supporting relief efforts. And we continue to waive international long distance charges for calls and text from US to the region.  My hope is that we will move to a peaceful resolution as soon as possible. In the meantime, we need to come together as a society and lean into what connects us, not what divides us. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-07-25 11:15:14", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website, a detailed review of our second quarter results. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Me and my team are pleased to report another solid quarter as we continue to advance across all of our strategic key performance indicators. Our newly appointed leadership team remains committed on delivering on our key metrics, growth on wireless service revenue, and expansion on consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We're seeing operational improvements throughout our business and our results are strong. Wireless service revenue was up 3.8% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA was $12 billion for the quarter. Cashflow from operation was very strong in the quarter at $9.7 billion, and free cash flow was $5.6 billion. The actions we\u2019re taking to accelerate growth, improve operations, and ensure solid balance sheet, are working. Our results today illustrate our ability to adapt, innovate, and excel, even in times of economic uncertainty, and we're encouraged by the growing importance of mobility, broadband cloud services in the 5G era in all customer segments. Based on our results this quarter and what we see ahead, I'm confident that we will deliver on our 2023 financial guidance. This is a testament to the hard work and a dedication of our team.  Now, let's look more closely at the performance in mobility, private networks, and national broadband. Our consumer wireless strategy of segmentation and financial discipline is paying off. This quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth in postpaid phone gross adds, significantly lower promo upgrade levels, and a sequential improvement in postpaid churn, all according to our strategy. This work is a continuous process, and we're always looking for ways to do better. In May, we launched myPlan, a first of its kind customized offering that gives our customers the value, control, and simplicity they want. This aligns with our strategy of bringing our customer the best value on America's best network. While we still are in early days, myPlan has already helped our Verizon Consumer Group deliver notable operational improvements by encouraging customers to take on premium plans, which is driving higher ARPA. We're really excited for what's to come for our new platform for selling consumer wireless services, and we're constantly evolving our offerings to fit customers\u2019 needs. We'll also continue to invest in prepaid to improve performance, and expect sequential improvements in the second half of the year. As we've reported in previous quarters, customer payments remain healthy, which shows both the financial strength of our customer base and the high value they place on our services. Our ongoing and effective strategy execution by Sampath and the consumer team, support a stronger Verizon where we are the premium provider, with elements like the new myPlan, strategic regionalization, persistent cost transformation, and the reinforced focus on customer satisfaction. We are strengthening our operational blueprint, with a local emphasis and effectively positioning ourselves for sustainable growth. Wireless access had yet another strong quarter, driven by continued solid phone and fixed wireless access performance, even as the secular decline in wireline continues. For the eighth quarter in a row, Verizon Business contributed more than 125,000 postpaid phone net adds, demonstrating the resiliency of our service offering to all types of businesses, and the value of our world class network. On private networks, we won a mandate from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and we recently completed work to launch a next-generation private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic that will support their mission for years to come. As a trusted partner to enterprise businesses and federal government, we work closely to transform the networks and bring organizations onto the leading edge of technology development. The total addressable market of private wireless is expected to grow significantly, and Verizon is well positioned to capture meaningful share. Our broadband strategy delivered more than 400,000 net adds in the quarter on Fios and fixed wireless access, marking another quarter of remarkable broadband performance. This represents the third consecutive quarter with more than 400,000 net adds, demonstrating the momentum of our growth trajectory. We have established a high pace of customer growth. It's clear, fixed wireless access is here to stay as a proven competitive broadband product. We're well on track to meet our target of 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers by the end of 2025, from a current base of nearly 2.3 million subscribers. We also now have an opportunity to segment the fixed wireless access market based on price and speed tiers so that our customers can choose the service that best suit them. Further, we continue to see net promoter scores of Fios and fixed wireless access that significantly exceed those of traditional cable offerings. We have the best network in the market. In the next couple of quarters, we will extend our lead with a large tranche of the C-Band spectrum. For the 31st time in a row, Verizon was the most awarded brand for wireless network quality in J.D. Power\u2019s US Wireless Network Quality Study. No other wireless provider has achieved this. And for 2023, we received top scores among all J.D. Power\u2019s study factors in all six regions. Additionally, our team continues to innovate within our network, upgrading our infrastructure around the country, and successfully testing our ability to slice our 5G network. Slicing will allow us to serve customers with dedicated 5G service on a large scale and to meet the diverse needs of the largest base of wireless customers in the United States.  Next, I want to address the recent news about the legacy lead cable in our network. We take these matters seriously, and to be very clear, lead infrastructure makes up a small percentage of our copper network, and we began phasing away from installing new lead cable by the 1950s. At Verizon, the communities we serve and our employees are at the heart of everything we do and we're using a fact and science-based approach in our assessment. You'll hear more on the topic from Tony later on. Our accelerated plans for efficiency with our new structure, which we put in place over the last couple of quarters, are already paying off. Verizon Global Services has taken action on a number of opportunities company-wide, realizing significant savings by focusing on IT platform transformation, leveraging artificial intelligence, rationalizing our real estate portfolio, and improving our supply chains. We're on track to achieve our forecasted $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2025. These savings, in combination with the completion of the $10 billion C-band spend, position us to generate strong cash flow and continue to invest in our business and pursue dividend increases as we execute on our capital allocation strategy.  Now, I will turn the call over to Tony to discuss our operations and financial performance in more detail.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Our results for the second quarter demonstrate our progress towards our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and increasing free cash flow. Our focus on execution is working, and we remain on track to meet our financial guidance for 2023. We are happy with our progress, but we have more work to do. We are focused on continuing to improve our performance, while remaining financially disciplined. In the second quarter, our consumer segment demonstrated better operating results, both sequentially and year-over-year in postpaid phone net adds. Additionally, we experienced continued strong performance within our business segment, both in terms of mobility and FWA subscriber growth. The results reflect the benefits of our ongoing C-band deployment and improved go-to-market execution.  Consumer postpaid phone net losses totaled 136,000 for the quarter compared to 215,000 net losses in the second quarter of 2022. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds were strong once again, up 6.9% year-over-year, driven by new-to-Verizon gross adds, which increased approximately 19% over the prior year period. We also saw notable growth in consumer postpaid ARPA, which was up 6.2% year-over-year. The recent launch of myPlan reflects a more segmented and targeted approach. While it's still early, myPlan is driving a significantly higher premium mix, with nearly 70% of myPlan customers taking the Unlimited Plus option. We are also encouraged by the step activity we are seeing. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.76%, up one basis point compared with the same period last year. Higher involuntary churn drove the year-over-year increase, offsetting a modest improvement in voluntary churn. Our involuntary churn rates remain at pre-pandemic levels and were flat for the third consecutive quarter. It is important to note our performance in existing C-band markets. In the 46 markets where we initially deployed C-band, postpaid phone gross add growth was more than 100 basis points higher in the quarter than in non C-band markets. Additionally, phone churn was four basis points lower in C-band markets, and our premium mix in C-band markets was 11 percentage points higher.  Let's now look at our business results. Verizon Business once again delivered solid performance and continues to expand on its industry-leading wireless market share. Demand continues to be strong in all three customer groups, resulting in 144,000 phone net adds for the second quarter, compared to 227,000 for the same period last year, which benefited from some large deals. As Hans mentioned, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we have delivered over 125,000 business phone net adds. We continue to win high value business based on the strength of our network performance and value proposition. Notably, we had a recent government contract win where we took share from two of our competitors at attractive ARPUs. Moving on to broadband, we maintained our strong performance, with 418,000 total broadband net additions in the second quarter. In the past four quarters, we've added more than 1.6 million broadband subscribers, growing our total broadband subscriber base by more than 21% during that time. Growth in FWA remained healthy, with 384,000 net adds, up from 256,000 in the prior year period. We now have nearly 2.3 million customers on our FWA product, and we expect growth to continue at a fairly similar pace in the third quarter. On the Fios side, internet net adds for the second quarter were 54,000, up from 36,000 in the second quarter of last year. Despite continued softness in household move activity, gross adds rose year-over-year, and our retention levels continue to be strong. Our value market team continues to take steps to address some of the softness we saw in the first half of the year. Prepaid net losses totaled 304,000 in the second quarter. Our year-to-date net add performance should represent the low point as we continue to make progress integrating TracFone, while taking actions to better position us for growth, including scaling our Visible and Total by Verizon brands. As Hans mentioned, we expect to see sequential improvements beginning in the third quarter. Let's now look at our financials, starting with consolidated revenue for the quarter, which was $32.6 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. The decline can be attributed to reduced wireless equipment revenue, which was nearly 21% lower than the prior year, as postpaid phone upgrade activity declined 34% versus the same period last year. Service and other revenue grew 0.8%, driven by wireless service revenue growth. Total wireless service revenue was $19.1 billion, up 3.8% year-over-year and more than $200 million sequentially. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from pricing actions, including a recent change to our Verizon Mobile Protect offering. Additionally, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, and growth in fixed wireless access, drove revenue improvements. These benefits were partially offset by continued pressure from the amortization of handset promotions. We are on track to deliver our wireless service revenue guidance for the year. We continue to assess opportunities to take targeted pricing actions to better monetize our products and services as we deliver great value for our customers. For example, we recently announced an increase in our FWA bundle pricing for new customers, which we expect will provide service revenue benefits in the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect less pressure from the amortization and promotional cost in the second half of the year, given the softer upgrade environment and our disciplined approach to promotional spending.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $12 billion, up 0.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 160 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by lower consumer postpaid upgrade volumes, and improved service revenue. These benefits were partially offset by higher marketing expenses in the quarter related to the myPlan launch, as well as a $194 million increase in bad debt year-over-year. Bad debt was relatively flat from the prior quarter, and payment trends remained consistent with recent quarters and pre-pandemic levels.  Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items, were down 5.9% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volumes. As Hans mentioned, we continue to execute on our cost savings program, including through initiatives within our Verizon Global Services organization. During the quarter, we took actions to rationalize our workforce as we continue to see benefits from rationalizing certain legacy wireline products. We are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million of savings this year from our transformation efforts, and continue to make progress towards achieving our goal of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual cost savings by 2025.  Cashflow from operating activities for the second quarter was $9.7 billion, and for the first half of the year totaled $18 billion, compared to $17.7 billion in the prior year period. The increase continues to be related to working capital improvements associated with lower inventory levels and fewer upgrades, which were offset in part by higher cash income taxes and interest expense. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.1 billion, which reflects the completion of our $10 billion accelerated C-Band program. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $10.1 billion, which was over $400 million less than last year. We continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. Our peak capital spend is behind us, and we are now at a business-as-usual run rate for CapEx, which we expect will continue into 2024.  The net result of cashflow from operations and capital spending is free cashflow for the quarter of $5.6 billion. Free cashflow for the first half of the year is $8 billion, a nearly $800 million improvement from the previous year, driven by a combination lower CapEx spend compared to the prior year, and operating cashflow benefits previously mentioned. While we do not normally guideline free cash flow, our strong results give us a clear line of sight to more than $17 billion of free cash flow for the full year.  Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.6 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the end of the previous quarter, and $4.1 billion lower year-over-year. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash on hand. We are well positioned with respect to our unsecured debt maturities, with no remaining obligations for the rest of the year. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times as of the end of the second quarter, a 0.1 time improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to monitor the current interest rate environment closely given recent comments from the Federal Reserve on planned rate increases later in the year. As previously stated, we expect higher interest expense to impact our full year earnings per share by $0.25 to $0.30, and there's no change to that view. Our strong second quarter results support our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged.  Before I hand the call back to Hans, I'd like to address the recent media reports on lead sheath cables in our network. Here is what we currently know. We still have some legacy lead sheath cable in our copper network. As a result of the age of this infrastructure and the history of the industry, records are incomplete as to exactly how much of the cable at our network has led sheathing. However, to give you a sense of the scale of the infrastructure we are talking about, our copper network is comprised of less than 540,000 miles of cable, roughly half of which is aerial, and lead sheath cable makes up a small percentage of our copper network. This number excludes the network elements previously owned by MCI and XO communications because we are still reviewing the historical records of those companies. When not disturbed, the likelihood of exposure to lead from lead sheath cables is low. In addition, because the lead sheath cable was used as a feeder and distribution cable and does not run into individual homes or apartments, it is generally in locations that minimize the potential for public contact. We are working with a third party expert to conduct our own testing at our sites that were identified by the media. We will not have the results of our testing for several weeks. When we have the results of our testing, we will work closely with our industry and others to address any concerns and issues.  Now, I think it's important to address a question we've received from a lot of investors, which is about the process for and potential cost of removal of the lead sheath cable in our network. Given where we are in this process, it is far too soon to make any projection on what the potential financial impact might be to the company. There are a number of unknowns in this area, including whether there is a health risk presented by undisturbed lead sheath cable, and if there is a risk, how that risk should be addressed. As a result, we do not believe there's a meaningful way to estimate any potential cost to the company or that any such estimate would even be useful. We won't be able to provide any additional color during the Q&A session. As we have more information we can share on the topic, we will certainly do that.  I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before we open it up to your questions. \nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. As we pass the midpoint of 2023, I'm pleased by how we're effectively delivering on our priorities, and I'm confident that we will meet the financial goals we set for ourselves for the full year. To summarize, in mobility, our segmented and disciplined approach to the market is working, and our efforts to improve the consumer group's performance will continue throughout the second half of the year. In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning as we capitalize on the unique strength and capabilities of both technologies. We continue to have the best network in the market, and our leadership position will only get stronger as we continue to roll out C-band. While we're encouraged by the quarter\u2019s results, there's more work to be done. My leadership team and I are laser focused on delivering what we committed to you at top of the year, strong wireless service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, as well as meeting our 2023 financial guidance.  By that, I hand it over to Brady for questions. \nBrady Connor: Okay. Thanks, Hans. Brad, we\u2019re ready to take the first question. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Looks like a nice beat on the consumer side, really driven by the postpaid ARPA growth of about 6%. Could you guys sort of pull that apart a little bit and maybe talk about the sustainability of that and the service revenue growth you saw as we head into the second half? I mean, I think you've got some - you lapsed some price increases, but you've got some other price increases coming through and some of the promotional stuff rolling off. And then maybe just quickly on the lead, obviously you guys can't quantify it, but when you guys say low exposure of the 540,000 miles of copper, is that single-digit? Can you guys tighten up that number for us a little bit? That'd be great. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, John. Let me start with the service revenue. I think we have been extremely focused on the service revenue. As you\u2019re seeing this quarter, we are expanding the growth from the first quarter, but it's many components. I understand you want to know a little bit more about the ARPA expansion, but we definitely see the broadband is adding to our growth. And then of course, our wireless business side is doing extremely well as well, I mean, eighth quarter we\u2019re on 125,000. So, we're actually doing a lot of things in different areas. But then if you go to the consumer group, they have been really good the last couple of quarters right now to be segmenting, targeting the right offering with the right pricing for the customers. And myPlan has been playing in very well to that. And as you heard Tony talking about, 70% are taking the premium plan. So, but that's just the start of it. We're not done, but clearly I\u2019m confident that the team knows how to manage this given how much we invested in research on the consumer side to understand our consumers better. And that's why we launched myPlan. So, all in all, I have to say, the guys are doing well. I'm confident we'll continue on this stride, but maybe Tony can give you some more on that and then we can come back to the lead. \nTony Skiadas: Yes, thanks, Hans. Good morning, John. So, on the service revenue, we're very confident in the guide. You mentioned tough comps that we face in the second half. When you think about the second half of the year, let me unpack some of the drivers for you. As you know, we executed a number of targeted pricing actions between the price ups on the Legacy Unlimited plans that we did earlier in the quarter, as well as most recently changes to our handset insurance program and price changes on FWA bundles. Secondly, we had the introduction of myPlan back in May. That's helped with premium mix and you heard that we're roughly 70% taking the Unlimited Plus plan. As Hans mentioned, we see an increase in contribution from fixed wireless access. We have 2.3 million subs in the base, and we have great momentum on FWA. And then fourth, we see continued improvements in year-over-year consumer postpaid volumes, and you saw that in the quarter. And then lastly, when you think about the promo amortization, the revenue impact from promotions and the promo amortization has decelerated in recent quarters, and that's - it's basically a function of our disciplined approach to promotions and retention. So, when you put that all together, we're very confident that all the initiatives here will continue to drive the meaningful revenue growth in the second half. \nHans Vestberg: On the lead, as I said, we take this matter very seriously, and we're doing exactly what you expect from Verizon. We're doing this scientific and fact-based. As Tony said, we're going over the different places that we pointed out by media and doing our own measurements with internal and external experts. And that's where we are. And we will do this very thorough. We are always doing things thorough. We do it fact-based, scientific, and that's how we're going to do, and that's what you should expect from us. \nTony Skiadas: Yes, and to add on to that, John, we're still reviewing the records, and we mentioned that we're still reviewing the historical records of the former MCI and XO network. So, that work is still ongoing as well. So, we still have more work to do there, and as we learn more, we'll keep you updated.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, John. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question, and I think I'll follow up on consumer volumes you alluded to in responding to John. It was great to see the consumer phone losses improve year-over-year. But I know your ambition is to do better than that. How do you think about path, getting back to net growth in consumer postpaid phones? Do you think you're going to need to take further actions in terms of the product mix or pricing or even any additional internal adjustments, or do you think you have the pieces in place and it's really just a matter of driving better execution against that framework? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I think it's about execution on the framework we have built right now. The guys have everything. Sampath and the team, together with Tony and me, they have the full support. We have a new platform in myPlan. We're segmented up the market. We work with financial discipline. The target we have, our team is continue to do sequential growth. And as you recall, Sampath and the team said before, ultimately, we want our fair share also on the net adds. But ultimately, we measure ourself on service revenue growth. And as you can see, we continue to improve that. So, it's more about now executing on this, being patient and see that both the network is the best in the market, but it's just improving. And some of the numbers that Tony talked about, you see the impact we have when the C-band is coming out. And then myPlan, you also see that is now initially what we have talked about is actually giving us really good confidence that we're in the right place. So, all that is in place. And then we do the regionalization as well at the same time. So, a lot of things is in place. It's more about execution and doing it with a financial discipline that you should expect from Verizon.\nBrett Feldman: And how do we think about a timeline for getting to sustainably positive net adds in consumer? Is that something that would be a reasonable expectation once you have C-band fully deployed?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Hi, Brett, it's Tony. So, volumes are important to the business, and as we said before, we're going to be very disciplined on how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. It's too soon to call third quarter positive for consumer. But as we said, we expect improvements year-over-year in consumer net adds. And the team and Sampath and the team are very focused on that.\nBrett Feldman: All right, thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to come back to the second phase of C-band. It was helpful to get those statistics. Could you just help us a little bit more in terms of what this is going to mean in terms of your footprint, both on the wireless side and on the fixed wireless side? How do we think that's going to help both coverage and also capacity? I know there's concerns in some quarters about fixed wireless facing congestion. It'd be great to let us know what your experience has been with usage and how you feel good about handling that 4 million to 5 million and beyond over the next few years. And then maybe a quick one for Tony. Obviously, the stock's been under some pressure here, pretty high yield. Perhaps remind us about how you're thinking about potentially going to buybacks. You're seeing some deleveraging now, strong free cash flow. Is that going to be an option here in the not-too-distant future? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Simon. When it comes to the C-band, I said we\u2019re ahead of the plan. As soon as we get hold of the next tranche of spectrum, the team is ready to continue to deploy that. That's going to give us both more capacity, but of course more coverage as well. So, it gives us both. And as you have seen the numbers we talk about here, as soon as we deploy C-band, we get better uptake from our wireless customers. And of course, we'll open up fixed wireless access. So, that should be positive over time for us. And when it comes to this lingering question about capacity, we don't have any capacity problems. I mean, the guys are doing an enormously good job, as always when it comes to Verizon and capacity network planning. Joe and the team are on it all the time and seeing that we're doing the right for our customers. And remember, we are building a multipurpose network. That means that we have one radio that serve multiple opportunities, wireless, fixed wireless access, in some cases private networks. So, all that is in one, and that's efficiency and the scale we're bringing right now, which we expected when we start with 5G and the C-band to see that we get the leverage model over time. But of course, it's going to roll out over the next year. So, I\u2019m confident that this will create more opportunities for us now when we get hold of the next tranche of the C-band spectrum. \nTony Skiadas: Okay, Simon. And then on your question on the cash generation here, we're very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which was very strong and reflective of our strong free cash flow results that is running higher than normal. As a reminder, we do have about $4.5 billion of the C-band clearing obligations remaining and due soon, and that's obviously a priority for us. The cash generation, as I said, is strong, gives us optionality and supports a much-improved dividend payout ratio. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We said first we would invest in the business. The second priority is our commitment to the dividend. Our third priority is to delever, and you'll see us be focused on that. And then once we get to the leverage metric of 2.25, we will consider buybacks at that time.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks so much. \nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, Simon. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next the next question comes Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thanks. With the price increases and the impact of the new pricing structure, it looks like you're trending above the midpoint of service revenue growth. I mean, could be closer to the high end. Any reason to think it decelerates from here? And then second, Hans, you spoke on private wireless. Can you dig into the market opportunity there and how long it takes for that to be a billion-dollar business? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I\u2019ll start with the second question and Tony can come back on the first. On the private wireless, what we have found out during the work we've been doing is that private 5G networks is something really, really valuable for enterprises and SMBs. And the main reason is that the capacity on it, the speed and the security, it basically starts as a Wi-Fi replacement on the license spectrum, and then you start adding onto it. It usually start with one factory, and if you see that it\u2019s working there, they do it in all factories. We have a growing list of new customers coming in, in the first phase. I would say this is a new business for us that again, is building on the same investment, the same Verizon Intelligent Edge network. I don't think we should expect that it's a billion-dollar business this year, but that definitely over time, this is a very important lever for Kyle and his team for growth in the service revenue and actually doing even better with enterprises. So, it's going to take some time, but I\u2019m really pleased what I've seen in the last couple of quarters how this is turning out. And I would say we have now an ecosystem with devices, with radio-based stations, with integrators and all of that, which we haven't had before. So, I'm more optimistic than a long time that private networks will be something. And as you know, I mean, we were way ahead of anybody else on this field, and that's why I feel really confident we will take more than our fair share.\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Good morning, Phil. And then on the service revenue, as we mentioned upfront, we have some tough comps as we lap the price ups from last year. We do expect sequential improvements in the third quarter. One thing to note, just on the prepaid revenue, we did see a headwind in the quarter of about $125 million. I would expect that to be at a similar level in the third quarter before it eases up in the fourth quarter. That's probably one additional data point for you.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Tony.\nBrady Connor: Yep. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open, sir.\nFrank Louthan: Great, thank you. Can you walk us through the correlation between the broadband adds and the business wireless adds, including both the Fios and the fixed wireless? And then you mentioned expecting some softer upgrades. Are you anticipating having to subsidize anymore for handsets to get adds as the year goes on? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: On the broadband side, I think I got the question like that, the correlation between the fixed wireless access and the Fios. I mean, let me say that, I mean, on the fixed wild access right now, we are growing that base, of course, mainly outside the (indiscernible) because that's just how it is because the Fios is so strong. So, we're doing great on the Fios business. And as you've seen, even though it's a softer housing movement season than before, we're doing great. I mean, over 50,000 again on Fios. So, Fios is doing really well. And then of course we have a portion of converged customers that is now growing. It's not growing that to come to European levels or something, but it's growing. The good thing for us is we have owners\u2019 economics on everything, fixed wireless access, wireless, Fios. We have one network with our own fiber. And that, of course, gives us opportunity to meet customer demands if they want convergence or not, and that nobody else has in the industry. So, really pleased with the development of broadband for us. We outlined this as one of the most important 5G innovations we've done. We add substantial new customers there. So, now this is a great opportunity there. And as you saw right now, we continue doing as we've done. I mean, we have now 2.3 billion customers on fixed wireless access. We can now start with different tiers, different pricings, so we can meet customer demands that have different requirements. And that's just good for us, but it's also really good for our customers because they can choose between different models depending on what needs to have.\nTony Skiadas: Yes, the only thing I would add is that we have a great rhythm at 400,000 broadband net adds in the quarter. And again, the third consecutive quarter of over 400,000 broadband net adds. And we continue to see good momentum with customers taking - wireless customers taking FWA and we see great progress there as well.\nHans Vestberg: And then you had a question on upgrades, and as you've seen in promos, that is clearly down in the second quarter and the first quarter as well. There are many reasons for it. Some are, of course, that we are much more financially disciplined. That's very important. But it also has haven't been any major new devices coming out. It'll probably come one in the second half. It usually comes. So, we're going to see that. But I don't foresee that we will come back to the levels we've seen before from a point of view of Verizon. We think that we are going to be disciplined. We're going to offer devices and promos and upgrades where there's the best for the segment and for the customer, but we'll not come back to the levels that we saw before.\nFrank Louthan: All right, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes, thanks, Frank. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. So, I wanted to come back to the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry. Before the lead, this was the big issue. And there were two pillars to the idea behind the relationship between Verizon and the cable industry. One was that somehow, Verizon had negotiated a deal with the cable industry that they would guarantee to make money no matter how much data cable consumers took. And the second was that that deal would never end. It was going to be forever. And so, I feel like the messaging on that has started to change from Verizon a little bit, and that maybe that the idea that cable industry's guaranteed to make money in the relationship between Verizon and cable, regardless of data consumption, that that's not true, and that this deal isn't permanent, that it could change at some future time, even though the DOJ - obviously, you need to have some deal, but it doesn't have to be this deal. And I was wondering if you could kind of just address that for us right now. Thank you,\nHans Vestberg: David, thank you for the question. This is a complex area. And remember, many of these things we cannot talk about. We have MDAs when it comes to a contract. The only thing that I'm securing is that Verizon making money on this. That, I can tell you. And we think this is an important business. These are important customers to us. And again, I go back to what I talked about before. We build the network once. The more connections, the more usage, and the more revenue we have on it, the better return on capital it is. And as long as we see that happening, we will continue the work we're doing. However, I cannot go into specifics on the contracts because first of all, I'm not allowed to do it. But clearly, you should feel confident that Verizon is doing that with the best interest of our stakeholders and our shareholders. So, and we want to get the best return on our invested capital in the network.\nDavid Barden: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open, sir.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good morning. Two questions if I could. First, just following up on the comments around tiering of fixed wireless and potentially on speed. Is there also an opportunity to begin tiering mobile 5G wireless in terms of megabits per second rather than a historical way of tiering on gigabytes per month of consumption? And then just secondly, you mentioned that the cash CapEx is tracking to guidance, but just curious, as you're deploying the mid band spectrum, the depth of it and seeing what the propagation is, are there opportunities to get further efficiencies in capital and potentially go below the business-as-usual indication of CapEx for 2024? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Hey, Mike, thank you for the question. On the question about different models over time, how we can charge for 5G, I think we find a good model within myPlan right now, with different type of network options. Then you can take your perks. All of it is accretive for us. You should just see the first sort of launch here as the first time we come out with a platform. We see multiple opportunities, how you can sort of diverse that one in different ways to meet different customer demand. So, you will probably see more of that going forward. I will do that. So, clearly, very important to us that we continue to meet our customers with new plans and things like that. But now we have a great base that is myPlan. On the CapEx side, I think we have gone over sort of a fairly long hump here, coming from Verizon Intelligent Edge network, investing in fiber, investing to in all the parts on millimeter wave, then coming into the hump of C-band. Now, we\u2019re coming into the BAU. As far as we can see right now is BAU is around 17 to 17.5, and that's going to see that we can deploy the C-band, getting all the benefits we talked about. 4G is coming down. Fiber is more success-based. So, there's a lot of things happening in there, but we're really confident that we can be on those levels and our team is really doing a great job. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Great. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead, sir.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Two questions if I could. First, if I could return to the lead topic for one moment. Can you just talk about the extent to which you used over-lashing of fiber to what might potentially be lead cables, particularly in your aerial plant in the Northeast? And then second, I just wonder if you could just help us think about the trajectory going forward of fixed wireless, which has seemingly sort of steadied out to a relatively stable number. Is that what we should expect? Because that would take us a bit higher than your guidance by the end of 2025. So, I'm just wondering how we think about the pacing of fixed wireless.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. I\u2019ll start with the fixed wireless access question because I think that is an important one, and the lead, we will hear from Tony on that one. On the fixed wireless access, you are right. I mean, we are now running on a fairly high level, adding a broadband subscriber quota. Remember, we have defined, we are roughly in, I would say, a little bit over 70 of the PEAs of C-band so far out of 402. So, that, of course, is how many OFS are open for sales we can do right now. So, that is a little bit. The next step going to be the next tranche coming in. And I said, we're well ahead to the 4 million to 5 million. The team is doing a great job. You also saw that we now are doing some great work on how we can address MDUs in a very efficient way. We're in the beginning of that. So, all in all, I think that fixed wireless access and how we\u2019re managing our network is going great. And of course, as a ambitious leader as I am, I expect that we can do better, of course. But right now, that's the forecast we have to 4 million to 5 million, and we're really doing well. And this customer satisfaction on fixed wireless access is so good. It's so simple. You install it yourself, you get broadband immediately. So, we are just meeting a consumer demand that no one else is doing, basically. So, I'm really pleased with the product. We talked about this being one of the most important 5G applications, and now you can see what it means to us and how important it's going to be over time.\nTony Skiadas: And then Craig, on the lead, as we said earlier, it's a small part of our network. It's about 50% aerial. We said we're still reviewing the historical records, both former MCI network and the former XO copper network. So, we still have work to do there. We're going to take a very methodical approach, very fact-based, very scientific-based approach. And as we know everyone wants more information, and as we learn more, we'll keep you updated. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Craig. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I want to ask too, if I could, I guess first just on the lead issue, I was wondering if you thought this might lead to an acceleration in copper network retirements and therefore an accelerated reduction in fixed costs for legacy networks. It seems like an opportunity in cases where communities might want to not have lead cable in their communities, even if it isn't actually shedding any lead. And then secondly, I just had a follow up to Simon's question earlier. Can you talk about how the remaining C-band deployments will affect the fixed wireless opportunity in rural areas? Specifically, how much of an expansion in the rural footprint will that represent versus the available footprint today for fixed wireless? And would that include a lot of areas that aren't served by anything today except for copper infrastructure? So, kind of the true rural areas. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: So, on the first one, we have always a plan for network transformation that is continuously ongoing. That has not changed. When it comes to this lead sheathed cables discussion, I said, I mean, we are going to go through this scientific. We're going to do tests. We're going to do it fact-based, and then we'll come back. But we have a normal network transformation that we constantly do because Kyle and team are doing that in order to keep up with the pressure of the secular decline in wireline. So, he will continue to do that, and we do that all the time. On the second question on fixed wireless access, yes, of course, when we - the first 70-ish, I would say, C-band mark PAEs, that is called, they are mainly in urban areas. And that's where we have had that good traction on fixed wireless access. And the next step is going to be much more suburban and rural. And of course, that's great opportunities because usually there are even less different options for customers in those areas. So, of course, that's going to create opportunity for us. That doesn't mean that we're changing our guidance. We still say 4 million to 5 million by 2025. Of course, the team is always driving hard here, and I'm driving hard. We always want to achieve. We want to show our stakeholders that we're a great company and we execute well, which I think we're doing. So, definitely, we see opportunities to be coming with the next tranche of C-band.\nBryan Kraft: Great. Thank you very much, Hans. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.\nTim Horan: Thanks. On the wholesale on the cable side, maybe just discuss wholesale wireless ARPUs broadly speaking. Do you think you can grow wholesale wireless ARPUs? And then the $10 increase in fixed wireless pricing, do you think that would slow kind of sub growth quarterly? We\u2019ve seen obviously good strength there. And then lastly, on the lead side, can you just qualitatively talk, how often are your workers exposed to lead? I\u2019m sure you have to log that. And what do you do to kind of protect workers, and have you ever seen any claims from workers on lead poisoning? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: There were many questions in all there. So, let me start with the change of discounts that we did on fixed wireless access. Again, we have a premium product. We have different type of optionalities for our customers in order to pick and choose what the best tier is or what the best service is. So, we think that this is just natural when you have passed over 2 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. And I think - just think about when we started with Unlimited, you start with one plan, and then you start to work with different segmentation, because ultimately we are in a very, very big consumer business where so many differentiated customers that needs different type of services. So, just think about it as a very natural step for us in order to serve our customers in a good way. Then I hand it over to Tony for the next question.\nTony Skiadas: Yes. On the cable partnership. I mean, as Hans mentioned, we don't go into the details. I mean, we continue to see volume growth in the relationship. And we're very satisfied with the relationship, and we continue to monetize the network, as Hans said earlier. \nTim Horan: And then on the worker lead exposure.\nTony Skiadas: We continue to work across the company and continue to take a methodical approach. We're not going to get into any specifics around employees or anything, but as we said, we'll keep you posted as we learn more. \nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Tim. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Sir, you may go ahead.\nPeter Supino: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask two questions, one on upgrade rates and the other on FWA. On upgrade rates, I wondered if you could discuss why they've fallen so much and whether it's sustainable, what the risks are to recent trend. And on FWA, just wonder if you could discuss the service price increase that we learned about this week. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes. On the upgrade rates, as I said before, I mean, first of all, we at Verizon have been very disciplined in how to offer sort of products and services with the right price at the right time. So, definitely, that has been that we are actually doing less promos and less upgrades. That has not hampered our way of growing our business or taking customers. And we will continue to work with that. Then, of course, hasn't been any major product coming out in the market. We expect that it's going to be a product coming out in the second half. We are excited over that. And of course, that's going to drive upgrades and promos of course. But again, we will continue to be very financially disciplined. But of course, we're excited for these type of things as it attracts store traffic, and when traffic comes, we are really good. And having good conversion rates, adding things to it to our customers, which is really, really important. And second, on the fixed wireless access, taking away the discount, and again, we come to a level of 2.3 million fixed wireless access customer. There are so many different type of customers and consumers we have. So, of course, having different tiers and pricings becomes very normal in order to meet customer demands. So, it\u2019s just how we do, and that we\u2019ll continue to do and see how the market is developing.\nPeter Supino: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Okay. Hey, Brad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: The final question for today, we'll come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open, sir.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks, Hans. I just want to actually do a follow up to that upgrade question. I think the last two years \u2026\nOperator: Walter, please check the mute button on your phone.\nHans Vestberg: We can hear you, Walter.\nBrady Connor: We can hear you, Walt. Go.\nWalter Piecyk: You can hear me? \nBrady Connor: Yes. \nWalter Piecyk: Okay. I don't know why he was telling me to check Maybe he was trying to mute me. So, the last two years. Hans, the upgrade rate has actually declined in the third quarter. So, I just want to kind of piecemeal together, like you said, you're not going to do handset promotions earlier in the call. Obviously, everyone knows Apple comes out with a new product, but in the last answer, it sounded like you thought people would upgrade more, but what seasonal trend should we see here? I assume you're still expecting it to be down year-on-year, but what about sequentially, because it's been typically down sequentially in the third quarter for the last two quarters. Maybe Covid had some impact on that, I don't know. And then my second question on CapEx. There's some debate, I think a lot of the tower companies specifically are trying to drive this narrative of like, oh, your C-band's going to get deployed, but they're doing fixed wireless and all these things. You're going to have to come back and do densification very quickly. So, any lull in CapEx will be short-lived. I'm just curious, I mean, obviously we saw the CapEx drop very quickly here in this quarter. How long do you think this kind of CapEx holiday will exist before you need to come back and use densification in the absence of additional spectrum sourced by the FCC? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Yes, thank you. On the upgrade, I cannot - I don't know anything about any launch or the product, how exciting it's going to be, but ultimate, that usage usually drive more upgrades. So, let's see what's going to happen this time and when it comes out. But we're always excited to see Apple coming out with a new phone. Hopefully, they're coming in this one. I cannot reveal what they are doing, but clearly, we're excited for that. On the CapEx, yes, you should talk to us. We know more about this than other companies. I would say we have a really good sustainable level of this. Densification is part of our strategy already. So, and many of the things that we already are deploying on C-band, we deploy sort of for the full spectrum already from the beginning. Then we turn on when we get those tranches. So, there's a lot of things that my team has done over years in order to be as efficient as possible with CapEx. That's why I feel really good on our sort of BAU around 17 to 17.5. I feel really good about that because we go through the extremely detail. So, we feel confident.\nWalter Piecyk: Great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Walt. Brad, that was all the time we had for today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-04-25 11:30:02", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. \nBrady Connor: Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; as well as our current Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis and Chief Financial Officer designate, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I would like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement which can be found on slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our first quarter results. Please note that, during the first quarter in order to better serve our customers we reorganized the customer groups within our business segment. We now report the following customer groups: enterprise and public sector business markets and Software as a Service and wholesale. Prior period operating revenue results within the business segment have been recast to reflect these changes. You will find additional details in the earnings materials on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call 2023. We delivered a solid first quarter marked by strong performance as we continue to execute on our plan to grow the business across mobility, broadband and private networks. We're making steady progress, and expect to keep up the momentum going forward. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue EBITDA and free cash flow. We grew total postpaid phone gross adds by 5% year-over-year this quarter and achieved 3% wireless service revenue growth $11.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA as well as a strong cash flow from operations of $8.3 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion versus the prior year. We're working everyday to move the business forward by using the power of America's most reliable network to deliver the best experience for our customers. During the quarter we reached more than 200 million POPs covered C-band in just over a year, since we lease up the first site. With access to that spectrum and advancing the build-out as quickly as we did we have enabled new source of revenue growth and elevated our customers' overall wireless experience. In the first quarter J.D. Power recognized us as the most awarded for network quality for the 30th time in a row. We're seeing improvements in already leading network performance validated by year-to-date root metrics testing and our customers are taking notice. Where we offer C-band, we see significant benefits in fixed wireless access consumer phone gross adds and retention, as well as premium take rates. We also see 4G customers benefiting as we offload traffic in some markets to our 5G Ultra Wideband network. The performance improvements will continue as 5G penetration expands market-by-market. We're excited about the remaining deployment of C-band spectrum and the potential dividend luck for both our business and consumer performance. Moving on to mobility. On the business side even in the current economic conditions by peers across different industries have combined confidence that mobility remains a priority in their spending. During the first quarter, Verizon business continued to run of strong performance, delivering 136,000 postpaid phone net adds. This was accomplished in spite of some pressures around restructurings within the technology sector. On the consumer side, payment trends are at healthy pre-COVID levels and consumers are shopping evidenced by our increase in consumer postpaid phone gross adds, which were up 11% year-over-year with the new to Verizon ads leading the way. Our gross ad performance is proof that our surgical and segmented approach to the market is working. We're in a much better position than a year ago, entering the second quarter with a sustained momentum around gross adds, as well as postpaid churn where we saw improved performance each month across the first quarter. We remain committed to our strategy not to compete on who can discount the most, but rather who can offer the most value to customers the best overall experience and the best customer satisfaction. +play is a great example of this. We listen to our consumers and introduce exciting partners like Peloton and Netflix, providing exclusive deals on an easy-to-use subscription managed platform and there is more to come. Our segmented approach to the market recognize that one plan doesn't not fit all and we have continued the work to address are underperforming segments. I've talked about our efforts to be more targeted and surgical with our retention. And we saw that play out during the quarter. By reducing upgrade volumes and lowering inefficient spending, we were able to deliver working capital benefits while finishing the quarter in a good place with churn and executing on migrations to premium unlimited. Those are real cash savings and a key driving to the large year-over-year improvements in free cash flow. You have seen us taking pricing action most recently on some of our legacy unlimited lands. We continue to look across our base and evaluate opportunities to more closely align pricing to our value proposition. On prepaid, we are working diligently to realize the full potential of this segment. While net ads were down by more than 207,000 versus the prior year this total was affected by two transitory factors. First, more than 100% of our net year-over-year decline came from higher disconnects within our SafeLink brand, which provides services to customers on government subsidized programs. We're still in the process of migrating customers onto our network as well. Prepaid is an important part of our value segment strategy and our investment here will continue as we're confident that will pay off in the long-term. Turning to broadband, which is a major growth area for us across consumer and business. We achieved the highest net adds in over 10 years, adding 437,000 total net adds within the quarter including 67,000 net adds from FiOS. We are very pleased with the FiOS performance with net adds up 12% year-over-year. For fixed wire access, we're seeing growth quarter-after-quarter of the quarter with 1.9 million subscribers at the end of the first quarter, fixed wireless continues to scale and contribute increasingly to our revenue performance. Our business customers are increasingly turning to fixed wireless access as the primary source of broadband connectivity, won over by the reliability and the overall value of the product. In addition to take any share from our competitors, we're also seeing new use cases across all of our customer groups, leveraging the flexibility of the product to expand beyond what traditional wired broadband can do. Finally, in private networks, our Verizon business team continues to execute at a high level. We announced new deals with KPMG and Deloitte and have a strong funnel of business ahead of us. We have also established a leadership position as a top network provider in the public sector. This quarter we announced a 15-year critical infrastructure contract with FAA, worth over $2 billion to design, build, and operate, and maintain the FAA's next-generation communication platform. This is in addition to many ongoing products we're working on for large federal agencies. In creating the networks that move the world forward, we remain committed to running our business responsibly for our customers, shareholders, employees, and society. Last month, we published our 2022 ESG report, which highlights how business, ethics, governance, environmental stewardship, and human rights are at the center of everything we do. I encourage you to take some time to review the report and learn about how we are managing risk and unlocking opportunities surrounding the issues of utmost importance for our stakeholders. Our commitments here come right from our leaders and their teams. A few weeks ago I announced new leadership for our two business units the network organization and our Chief Financial Officer. These leaders come with nearly 100 years of experiences within Verizon and bring a proven track record of successful execution. Let me take a moment to walk through these changes. Sampath takes over as a CEO of Verizon Consumer. His objectives are clear; to enhance our consumer operation model and experience, deepen our segmentation approach, scale fixed wireless access and broadband, and drive financial discipline. Kyle Malady was appointed CEO of Verizon Business. CIOs are increasingly searching for technology reach solutions and nobody knows our technology like Kyle. His focus is clear; drive sustainable growth in mobility and deliver on the revenue growth opportunities within fixed wireless, 5G private, wireless, and mobile edge compute solutions. Joe Russo takes over as a President of Global Networks and Technology to continue our efforts to extend, enhance, and solidify the nation's leading wireless network and vast global IP and fiber network. Finally, Matt Ellis leaves us at the end of the month on the 10 years at Verizon and six years as our CFO. I want to thank him for his many contributions to our business. Tony Skiadas assumed the title of Chief Financial Officer on May the 1st. I appreciate Tony's work to improve operations and drive performance as we search for a long-term CFO replacement. So, let's now move on and talking about efficiencies. The teams are on the way to deliver better, simpler, and more efficient end-to-end processes for our customers and employees. Spearheaded by the Verizon Global Services Group, we're looking into numerous areas across the business that will help drive bottom line growth including IT platform transformations, building advanced AI models for the better diagnostic and predictive insights, optimizing our real estate footprint and managing our supply chain efficiently. We have also reduced headcount over the last quarters. All-in-all, our cost efficiency program is on track to achieve our target of $2 billion to $3 billion of annual savings by 2025, which will help to fund our growth as well as drive margin improvements over time. With almost all our 10 billion C-band capital expenditure program behind us, we expect our cash generation profile to expand over the next few years, driven by revenue growth, cost management and efficiencies with capital expenditures. This helps support our objective to achieve consistent dividend growth with our 16 consecutive years of increases, currently the longest streak in the industry. As we look to build on the free cash flow growth generated in the first quarter, we expect to see significant improvement in our dividend payout ratio this year, putting the board in a strong position to increase the dividend once again and bring us closer to our debt targets over the following years. Going into the second quarter, I'm energized by the execution of the Verizon team and our new leadership across key positions. We remain focused on delivering for our customers and driving service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow expansion. And with that I will now turn it over to Matt for the last time.\nMatt Ellis: Thank you, Hans. And good morning. Our results for the first quarter reflect the steps we have taken to improve our performance. C-band and the investments in our network are having a positive benefit on customer and overall network experiences. And as Hans mentioned, we are seeing a direct benefit around fixed wireless and phone gross adds among other metrics, where we operate C-band but more work remains to be done. Taking a look at operating results of the first quarter, let's start with consumer postpaid phones, which had $263,000 net losses for the quarter compared to $292,000 net losses for the prior year period. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds was strong across the quarter, up over 11% year-over-year continuing the momentum from the second half of last year. Our efforts around the segmentation of our base and our more targeted go-to-market approach and offerings to those different customer groups have been key drivers behind our improved gross add performance. Consumer postpaid phone churn for the quarter was 0.84%, up 7 basis points compared to the same period last year. We are now seeing a return of involuntary churn rates to pre-pandemic levels. As for voluntary churn, performance was mixed across the quarter starting off elevated as we saw normal holiday season activity extend into the early parts of the first quarter. But as the quarter progressed, we saw improvements in terms of year-over-year churn performance, exit in the quarter with voluntary churn rates in line with last year. While we have more work to do to improve consumer net adds, we are encouraged by the double-digit percentage improvement in gross adds combined with the improved churn level at the end of the first quarter. We entered the second quarter with significantly better momentum than a year ago. Moving on to the business segment. Verizon business again delivered strong results. We saw solid demand across our three customer groups and had 136,000 phone net adds for the first quarter compared to 256,000 for the same period last year. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a couple of large deals that contributed to our net adds results a year ago. Additionally, we saw an increase in churn due to business customers being more cautious around spending and the restructurings Hans noted in his remarks. Moving along to broadband on a consolidated basis, we delivered 437,000 net additions in the first quarter, the most in a decade. As expected, we saw another quarter of sequential growth in fixed wireless with 393,000 net adds, up from 379,000 in the prior quarter. Customer satisfaction remains high as evidenced by NPS scores, as well as encouraging churn trends around the more tenured cohorts of customers. On the fire side, Internet net adds for the first quarter was 67,000, up from 60,000 in the first quarter of last year. Customers continue to be attracted to our high-quality broadband products, which is reflected in the year-over-year increase in FiOS gross adds even in an environment with lower move volumes versus the prior year. FiOS retention rates continue to be strong with our best churn performance in more than five years. While the first quarter results were prepaid were below our expectations, we remain confident in the value market opportunities and the benefits of having a portfolio of assets and plans to satisfy the needs of all of our customers. You heard from Hans some of the actions we are taking to create long-term value. As expected in the short-term these actions are having a negative impact on our prepaid net ads. Together with the elevated disconnects and our SafeLink brand that Hans referenced, we expect pressure on prepaid net adds to increase in the second quarter before they abate later in the year. Moving on to the financials. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $32.9 billion, down 1.9% year-over-year primarily due to equipment revenue being lower by 9% as well as continued declines in business wireline services. Wireless service revenue was $18.9 billion, up 3.0% year-over-year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, results for the first quarter included a benefit of approximately 185 basis points associated with the large allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue. This benefit was partially offset by the impact associated with the shutdown of our 3G network completed at the end of the fourth quarter. The shutdown resulted in the removal of approximately 1.1 million retail connections and the corresponding loss of revenue for the first quarter and beyond. We continue to see pressure on service revenue from the cost of promotions and the amortization impact in the first quarter. Additionally, we see pressure from prepaid revenue as a result of lower subscribers versus prior year. To help offset these pressures, we've recently implemented additional pricing actions across our business and consumer segments. We expect to see the benefits of these actions ramp across the second quarter as the business segment began billing customers closer to the end of the first quarter, while consumers started earlier this month. As a result of these combined pricing actions, we anticipate approximately $75 million of incremental quarterly revenue moving forward. Additionally, the consumer team is working to improve efficiencies around device promotions and credits that we expect to yield revenue benefits across the remainder of the year. We believe that the actions the teams are taking will grow the top line driving both EBITDA and cash flow. To complement this, the team expects to make additional progress across 2023 on the development and implementation of cost efficiency initiatives resulting in a meaningful savings run rate at the end of the year. During the first quarter, operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were down 2.4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower cost of equipment from reduced upgrade volume which helped to offset an increase in bad debt of approximately $200 million. Similar to involuntary churn rates, bad debt expense reflects the return of collections to pre-pandemic levels. While up year-over-year, bad debt expense is relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter totaled $8.3 billion, compared to $6.8 billion in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to working capital improvements, driven by lower inventory levels, coupled with fewer upgrades and a modest improvement in customer payment patterns, despite the current macroeconomic conditions. CapEx for the quarter came in at $6.0 billion, which includes most of the remaining $1.75 billion of C-band-related spending in our guidance. With the conclusion of the program, we would expect a step down in the pacing of overall CapEx throughout the remainder of the year and continue to expect 2023 capital spending to be within our guidance of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the quarter of $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion versus last year. Total unsecured debt for the quarter was $132.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion compared to the end of 2022 and $5.3 billion lower year-over-year. This resulted in net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times as of the end of the first quarter. A 0.1 times improvement compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat from the prior quarter. We continue to have very low near-term unsecured debt maturities with the only maturity remaining in 2023 and being approximately $600 million due in the second quarter. I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be my last earnings call as Verizon's CFO. It has been a fulfilling 10 years at Verizon and a privilege to serve as CFO and I'm thankful to everyone that has made it such a rewarding experience. From our talented finance team to my fellow executive team members to all of you that have had the pleasure of getting to know, I want to say thank you. Verizon is in good hands with Tony as its CFO. I've worked closely with him since my first day at the company and I know he will always strive to drive the business forward in a way that puts Verizon and its shareholders first. I truly look forward to seeing what he and the entire Verizon team will achieve, as I chair them on from the sidelines, as an enthusiastic customer and shareholder. With that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for concluding comments, before we open up to your questions. \nHans Vestberg: Thanks, Matt. In summary, our disciplined approach has led to significant progress on our key strategic plans and we need to keep the momentum and focus going. We're pleased with how 2023 has started. We continue to deliver the best customer experience on the most reliable network supported by the best people in the industry. In mobility, our segmented and surgical approach to the market is working and we are taking pricing actions where possible. In broadband, the combination of fixed wireless access and fiber is winning, as we continue to capture market share. We'll continue to grow our cash generation profile and maximum shareholder returns, aided by our cost efficiency program and lowered capital expenditures. I remain confident in our strategy and our strong focus on execution. We are always identifying new ways to evolve our business and execute on opportunities. In everything we do, we focus on driving profitable growth. We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders for our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Brady over for the questions.\nBrady Connor : Thanks Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions this morning. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question for today comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Good morning guys. And Matt thanks for all the help over the years and best of luck to you in the future. If I could just start with a couple of wireless questions. First on the gross side of the consumer side, obviously, some strength there. Any other detail you can give us in terms of what's driving the double-digit improvement. I think AT&T saw a decline. It just any change in the promotional posture or anything you're doing there? And then on the other side of the ledger churn, obviously, up a little bit year-over-year but it sounds like you're making some trends. Did you guys make any pricing changes on the consumer side in the first quarter? And just -- any comments around the sustainability of those improvements as we look forward throughout the year? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Let me start and then I'll hand it over to Matt. I think what we saw in the first quarter was very much the momentum. We start building I would say end of the third and into the fourth when it comes to both how we converted our customers to be part of our journey with the more segmented approach. And that we have seen through the quarter when it comes to our gross ads that many of the initiatives we have had all the way from the welcome plan and many of the others they have been working well for us that partly is what we have been doing. And then, of course, I think we're much more focused. And, of course, now with the new team in place as well where we have full alignment with Sampath when it comes to the execution here and seeing that we're getting the right customers in. I think that has been helpful as well. Then as you have seen we're coming in and out of the quarter with promotions. We really are taking the opportunity when we see that we have an opportunity to bring in customers. So that's how are you seeing the momentum continue. And as Matt said also in his opening here, we have seen that momentum continuing for us. And for the churn, I will hand it over to Matt. But as I said I mean we had a little bit higher in the beginning of the quarter and it continued to improve. And we\u2019re working with both that as well as we continue to create the momentum we have right now on the consumer wireless. Matt?\nMatt Ellis: Thanks Hans. Good morning John. So on the churn side; certainly we saw improvement as the quarter went on. We had a lot of carryover from holiday level churn in January by the time we got to March we saw a much better momentum there. So that's the jump-off point as we go into second quarter. The pricing changes that you mentioned in your question really didn't go into effect until we came to the moving from Q1 to Q2, so that will be incremental to the results of the business here as we get into the rest of the year. So -- but as Hans said really a case of rebuilding from the momentum last year that was a year ago was not where we wanted it to be. At the midpoint of the year, we talked about taking actions and you see the results of those actions showing up in the results. And so the team is focused on continuing to build from there.\nJohn Hodulik: Perfect. Great. Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Thanks John. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'd also like to reiterate my thanks to Matt for all his help over the years. My question is about fixed wireless. So when I look at the formal remarks document you put out, it looks like you still have just over 40 million households where that can get your fixed wireless service. The reason I bring it up is that would appear to be a fraction of the availability of your ultra-wideband network, which now covers over two-thirds of the population. So, I was wondering, how do we think about the game plan for expanding the distribution of the fixed wireless service now that you have significantly expanded the ultrabroadband -- ultra-wideband network? And how do we think about the cadence of quarterly fixed wireless and agent here? Is there still going to be a tailwind, or are we getting to a point where it's leveling now? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Brett. First of all, we're really pleased with the performance on the fixed wireless access. The team is doing a great work. And remember, it's not only the consumer side, it's the business side as well. On the business side, many new use cases are coming up on using fixed wireless access. So, the team are scaling and we're on scale right now. So, like the rhythm, I see on our sales motions right now and if you see in the first quarter, almost 400000. When it comes to the network, you know that later -- the latter part of this year in December actually -- or we will get our next chunk of C-band. Right now, we're covering some 70 markets out of over 400. It's 330 markets left, we will get the C-band. And we clearly pointed out in the opening here that, we opened a C-band. We're not only seeing fixed-wireless access opportunity. We also see step-ups and a greater upgrade cycle for our customers because they see the improvements on the C-band. So we're very encouraged by the C-band coming out. But as I said, we're waiting for the clearance by the year-end to get even more. But as we roll out, right now, we open up markets. And remember, we talked about that we are in the network team, we're now decentralizing, so we can attack locally, because we are sort of opening markets locally. The same goes what Sampath is working on right now is also taking his operations more locally, so we can both the marketing and execution locally. And you might have seen it that we do more local things, because as we open up more on fixed wireless access, we do that locally. And so far our success rate is high. We're just going to go do this in the right way to take the learnings with us doing better all the time. We also have started with differentiation on different type of peers when it comes to our fixed wireless offerings. There's a lot more to be done there. But as I said, I'm very pleased with the rhythm and the market share we're taking and remember, the C-band so far is deployed mainly in urban and suburban areas, where the majority of the spectrum coming is actually in more of the suburban and rural. And we also get of course more urban spectrum as we're only deploying 60, maybe 80-some megahertz, 100 where we are in average 160. So, I have to say, this is one of the biggest 5G used cases we have right now and we really see good traction. So that's how we're going forward. \nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks Brett. Brad, ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you, very much. Good morning and again my best wishes to Matt for the future. Just following up on Brett's fixed wireless question, you talked about scaling. It looks like you're almost hitting two million fixed wireless subscribers now. How is it working on the network capacity side of things? And what's your confidence in going to continue to handle increasing usage from the customers as this continues to scale? And then, if we could just go back to the announcement, I think it was March 3 of the new appointments. You talked a little bit about Kyle and Sampath. But what if we were inside Verizon, what are the big changes that have taken place over the past seven weeks or so that are really changing the trajectory particularly of consumer. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Simon. On the capacity, the guys is great. First of all were used on an initial trends of spectrum that we're using as I said, we were fixed wireless access on the ultra-wideband. We have so much more capacity coming. On top of that, all the new features you have with advanced 5G carrier action we have new devices coming out that can handle different spectrum. So there are so many more things, I feel really confident that, we will manage this capacity without any problems to the levels we have talked about and way beyond that. Then of course, as I talked with many of you guys, if it comes a moment that we have a community that have a lot of fixed will have over time other opportunities of sales splitting, et cetera. We are not even close to that today. So, I feel really good about, how the guys are managing the network and the opportunities we're building on our C-band here. As I said on the 4G fixed price actions, they were more opportunistic and selling when we see that we have capacity, but not sort of where we see that we have that full. We're not selling any more. But this expansion is right now on 5G Ultra Wideband. When it comes to the new team the big changes I've seen first of all, the first big change is that these guys are operational day one. I mean, both Kyle and Sampath straight into. If you look at Sampath, he's very much focused both on the customer dimension and seeing that we were improving the momentum we have right now on gross ads and churn and see that we actually improving through the year. But it also works with our offerings and our operations see that we're even stronger locally. Kyle on the other hand continuing the work of Sampath great momentum on Business Wireless as we continue this quarter private networks is really taking off. And then on top of that working with a wireline decline to see that we're taking out cost at the same time managing our contract and I don't think there's no one better than Kyle. He knows the network that more than anybody else. So I think that's the main focus and they've been really fast. And then of course the transitions between Tony and Matt is going extremely simple because these guys have worked together for 10 years. Tony is already into all the operations working very closely with the new leaders all the way from Joe that's running networking Kyle and Sampath. So I feel good. I feel really good and confident about it and it's very clear that the priorities there. So maybe, Tony you can say something about your priorities. \nTony Skiadas: Sure. Thanks, Hans, and good morning, Simon. I'm excited to have the opportunity to succeed Matt as the CFO. In terms of my priorities, I have three of them. First supporting our new leaders Sampath, Kyle and Joe in executing their strategies. And that includes narrowing our focus with a very strong emphasis on operational performance; second, ensuring that we deliver the 2023 financial guidance that we laid out in January; and third, ensuring that we continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy the four capital allocation priorities that we shared with you last year those remain unchanged. So those are my three priorities right out of the gate. And as Hans mentioned, the transition has gone exceptionally well. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much, and good luck.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks Simon. Brad, ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Hi. Thanks very much. Two if I can. First, can you expand on the bad debt and churn discussion and how that relates to the upgrades which seem to be fading through the quarter? And then second, if you can talk about prepaid. Are the losses mostly happening in SafeLink and what is happening in this and the different brands and any conversion of prepaid to postpaid this quarter? And how would you report that if it was happening? Thanks very much.\nHans Vestberg: Okay. That was a lot of questions in one. I will start on the high level here on the \u2013 as we said earlier, the payment patterns are basically same as pre \u2013 we have a high-quality customer base. We see this is very healthy at the moment all the way. I will ask Matt to expand on that because looking backwards. And then when it comes to the question on prepaid or value segment yes, as we said in an opening here, I mean the negative number is I would say 100% coming from SafeLink, which is a government-subsidized brand. But there are other puts and takes there as well. I think that the visible brand is doing well. We're just ramping up total wireless which is an important piece of it not having all the things coming through there. So \u2013 and then of course we have the network migration still happening. So it's combination of a lot of things on the different brands. Our confidence is that we will improve that at the latter part of the year when some of these things are moving out. So that's a general comment maybe on the churn piece Matt, if you say something.\nMatt Ellis: Yes. So, thanks, Phil. So looking at the churn and the bad debt and to your question was more around the bad debt side. So certainly up a little bit year-over-year but more importantly flat sequentially. And what you're really seeing is first quarter last year we still had some impacts in there of some of the COVID-related activities. That's now fully out. And I'd say we're back to [indiscernible] run rate. In terms of the \u2013 with the lower upgrades in there, also the plus 11% phone growth adds, Hans mentioned in his prepared remarks a lot of those growth adds were new to Verizon. And those new to Verizon customers typically come in at a different bad debt accrual rate than upgrades which is existing customers that we know well and so that's the trade-off there. The other thing I look at on the bad debt side. One, you see from our most recent ABS filings at our FICO scores across our base continues to be very strong. We've talked for many years now about the quality of the Verizon postpaid base and you see that there. And then secondly, the payment patterns we actually had from customers this quarter actually just slightly better sequentially in terms of the aging. So we're seeing good behavior, good payment activity from our customer base, which is why you see the flat bad debt on a sequential basis now that we're fully through the COVID period.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks. If I can just follow-up, was there any conversion from prepaid to postpaid, or I may have missed it?\nMatt Ellis: A little bit but nothing material, but that's obviously, certainly something the team is very focused on going forward having that opportunity in the got that's still ahead of them to be a much more meaningful contributor going forward.\nPhil Cusick: Great. Thanks, again, Matt.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Phil. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all the help, Matt. I guess in the prepared remarks Matt, I think you mentioned that there were going to be some cost efficiency benefits in 2023. I was wondering if you could kind of -- in that $2 billion to $3 billion target talk about the cadence of how you see that unfolding in maybe the second half of this year and into the coming years? And then the second question would be one of the things that's contributed to, I think, the momentum that you guys have been talking about a lot on the call has been a combination of the new kind of more affordable welcome and limited plan and a lot of the marketing you've been doing. Could you talk about what the new kind of management team want to do to take that maybe to another level if at all this year and kind of what the end goal is flat subscribers to goal, or is market share of the goal? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I will start and then I will toss the question on cost to Tony, and I will start with your second question. So the team, I think, we just need to divide the wireless question that you have. On the business side, I think, it's clear we're really strong. We are taking market share. The team is working through SMB government and large enterprises with our offerings where the network is the key contributor. Kyle will continue that work and the drumbeat we have there. On the consumer side, I think, that Sampath and I are 100% the line that we are in a momentum where we are now going to continue to improve our net additions on consumer, but most importantly is to grow in the service revenue. But of course, we want customers as well. But mostly important is growing the service revenue and expanding the cash flow and EBITDA. That's really the main focus for Sampath that were 100% the line on. But that also means that we need to take customers. And I think that we will continue to evolve our proposition and coming with new products. So I feel encouraged what I've seen so far and the thinking that Sampath and the team have, but we need to stay tuned for some of the new things coming, Tony? \nTony Skiadas: Thanks Hans. David, good morning. So, on the cost side as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're making progress with Verizon Global Services and all the cost transformation efforts. As we mentioned previously, we're on track with our cost efficiency program to take $2 billion to $3 billion of cost out by 2025. Within that, we'll see some of those benefits manifest themselves in the second half of this year in 2023 with significant savings in 2024 and really focused on areas like sourcing transformation IT conversions and transformations as well as supply chain and other AI models. \nDavid Barden: Yes. Good. Thank you.\nBrady Connor : Yes. Thanks, Dave. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. And Matt I also want to express my thanks and best wishes as you leave Verizon. If I could focus on two topics. First on the ARPU side if you can unpack a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing on the unlimited and premium unlimited take rates and where those can go over time in terms of continuing to monetize the network and the bundles that you offer? And then on the lower upgrade rate, are you seeing a fundamental change in customer holding periods for devices and what does that mean for the size of the switcher pool in the industry going forward? \nHans Vestberg: I can start. I mean we -- I can on a high level say, we continue to see the trend from our customer on postpaid going to unlimited and then go to unlimited premium. That continues to team is doing great work to see that we're doing that transition. And -- but we still have opportunities. We still have customer meter plans. We still have a portion or One Unlimited can go to unlimited premium. So we still see that as an important growth trajectory for our ARPU going forward. And then on the upgrades, I mean, we have talked about before, I mean, the market indication is that, it's going to be a little bit smaller switcher pool. That doesn't mean that we feel that we shouldn't be taking more fair share. We should definitely do that and continue to see that our customers that we have, we're expanding with them and then we're actually bringing new customers. So, I think, that's what we see right now. But, again, we have good momentum with all the offerings we have. I expect my consumer team come out with new offerings as well. So -- and continue that drum beat. Matt?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. No, exactly, Hans. And, Mike, good morning. So as you think about it, the strategy is one always to get the customer in, then have the opportunity to move customers up the stack and you see we've done that number of different ways over the years and you should expect us to continue to find ways to do that. And then, also, we get the opportunity to add other things to the account, so fixed wireless access allows us to increase ARPU and adding other devices to the accounts too. So there's still significant opportunities there for us to grow share of wallet with the customer as we go forward. And I would expect that the consumer team will continue to make sure that they are having the right pricing constructs and offerings in front of customers and those will constantly evolve over time, so that we can continue to grow ARPU.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. And if I could just throw one other out there. Just from a government program perspective, can you share how Verizon participates in ACP? And any new thoughts on potentially participating in the BEAD program?\nMatthew Ellis: Yeah. So I'll take the first shot. Look, ACP is an important program. As you've seen, the actions we've taken over the past few years, whether it's the acquisition of TracFone, the introduction of plans like Welcome. We want to participate in all customer segments. That includes ACP, whether that be on the wireless side or the fixed side. So we do participate in those programs. And then, as the BEAD programs come out, we will look for where it makes the most sense for us to participate in those programs. We've been doing -- we've been building fiber out to homes for a long time. We continue to do so. Over 500,000 new OFS last year, we said we'd do something in that same region again this year and into the foreseeable future at that type of run rate. So as that -- those new programs help us the opportunities to continue to do that, we'll certainly be very interested in looking at using them where it makes sense.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Great. Thanks Mike. Brad, go ahead for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open, sir.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. I want to sort of step back to a more strategic question about the wireless business if I could. I mean, for years your business model and your -- and sort of the way you came to market was based on a very low churn strategy, therefore, arguably you didn't need the same number of gross ads to sustain growth. And it was based on a very clear value proposition of best network. It seems like all of those pieces are quite different now. And despite what you said about the prospects for churn, churn is quite a bit higher for retention. How do you kind of win the battle for the hearts and minds, particularly in the consumer segment, by sort of returning to the base of convincing customers that yours is really the best network and sort of how do you win with the value proposition?\nHans Vestberg: I will start here. First of all, what we see right now is we have a clear value proposition when we roll out the C-band. We have great, great uptake step-ups from our customers when they see the C-band. And you know better than anybody else how much of that spectrum we have right now, which is a very little bit. And with all that we get this momentum that's why I feel so good about it. And then as Matt said our churn a little bit elevated, but it's also improving in the quarter. So, we're working on that. And having a gross the gross add momentum at the same time. That tells you something about where we're going right now heading. And then we have Sampath in the role that really know operational execution. So, I think we have all that and we have the best network clearly and it's just going to get better. I mean with every measurement we do right now, we are clearly come out as number one. And the only thing I know for sure, we're going to extend that leadership with the C-band continue to roll out. So, our proposition is very clear continue to have the best network have a good proposition for our customer because you need to continue to do new offerings to the consumer group because their behaviors are changing as well. That's why we came with it +play. We're listening to customers to make it easier and all of that. And you haven't seen the loss from us. So, I think that we're building on all the strength we have and those strengths are even getting stronger. \nBrady Connor: Thanks Craig. Yes, Brad, we're ready for next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTim Horan: Thanks guys. Can you be a little clearer on the network upgrades, it looks like you're more than doubling the amount of spectrum by year-end. What does that mean for coverage do you think in capacity? And when will we get to 300 million homes passed and more like 70 million or 80 million that have the ability to get fixed wireless? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: So, on the network you're absolutely right. We have on the C-band where you started to roll it out in the majority of the 60, 70 markets we're rolling out right now, we're using 60 megahertz. And you know we have an average 160 megahertz and in many places even up to 200 megahertz. So, it's an enormous difference when it comes from 60 to 160 megahertz, how much more capacity there is and on top of that of course we are adding new type of software features like carrier gauge [ph], the chip is getting better in devices both the handset and the fixed wire access devices. So, that's going to enhance the capacity for us. And as I said we were very focused to see that we materialize our business cases for the C-band all the way from consumer and business wireless to fixed wire access and mobile edge compute and private networks. So, we focus on the revenue generation of it and we'll continue to do so. But clearly it's going to be a step-up when we get the next tranche. And we're going to open more homes for households penetrated with fixed-line access and we're going to have much more markets covered by the C-band. So, we're just going to continue that journey as fast as we can.\nTim Horan: But does the increase section help the coverage, or do you still have to build out in those areas?\nHans Vestberg: I would say as we said from the beginning which many people doubted, we can use our existing 4G grid for the C-band. There is -- we don't need any new. However, we always build some new sites. We find new areas where there have been capacity constrained. We'll continue to do that as well. But mainly our C-band is using the 4G grid in order to see that the coverage is coming out there. And this year we're going to build a little bit more sizeable [ph] than we've normally done and the -- and our 4G spectrum, AWS and et cetera is covering 300 million pops a day. And that's where we be large band right now.\nTim Horan: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Great Tim. Thanks. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Hans, strategically you face a few choices, which I think are contradictory in some way and there is an attempt to grow gross adds, obviously, but SG&A is growing faster than revenues and so that puts pressure on margins. And it also comes with cash flow trade-offs. And we are trying to increase price to offset this margin impact but that comes with churn trade-offs. So ultimately when you think about your growth model or the growth have to double, what's the north star, is it unit growth? And are you willing to sacrifice margins and cash flow to get to that turnaround point, or is it margins? Even if it comes at the expense of unit growth, because it does feel like there is a choice that has to be made at some point. And I'm just wondering what the metric is that you're most focused on? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I think it's crystal clear. Our metrics that we're measured on is the service revenue and the EBITDA and cash flow expansion. You still need to have customers for that and you need to grow that. But ultimately that's what we measure ourselves on to see that we can grow that. And that's what you have seen from us right now. And you see the cash flow in the quarter. We are very focused on that. We think that's very important for all the stakeholders. And so then, of course, units are important but it's even more important to see that we have the right growth metrics when it comes to the company's finance. But maybe Tony wants to add something here.\nTony Skiadas: To just add on to what Hans mentioned. I mean, we have to be disciplined and segmented in how we approach the market. Our focus is on volumes that drive profitable revenue growth. So the team is laser focused on that.\nBrady Connor: Good. Thanks, Kannan. Brad, we\u2019re ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nPeter Supino: Hi, thanks. Question back to fixed wireless. Obviously, the expansion to suburban and rural markets is a big opportunity back in the urban areas where your C-band depth is going to more than double in 2023. Is there any reason that expansion shouldn't support accelerated marketing and approval of inbounds about FWA so that you would drive up your net ads in those markets as well?\nHans Vestberg: That's clear. I mean and that's why our organization both on the consumer side and the business side and our network side it's more regional right now, because we're following the deployment of the network and doing marketing and outreach to our customers on fixed virus access that really want to have it when we open up. So clearly you're right there is also opportunity in the urban places where we get more capacity or more coverage and as it goes for the suburban and the rural.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks Peter. Brad, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Can you -- with the business changes, can you walk us through on the SaaS line? What is SaaS revenue in total and where can you see growth there? And then back to the phone adds with the new level of gross adds you're getting, are there any characteristics about this type of customer you're tracking now that might be different than say two years ago and what their long-term churn characteristics might be?\nHans Vestberg: You need to repeat the first question. You're talking about SaaS revenues?\nFrank Louthan: Well with the breakout \u2013 you break out on the business line item. Just curious how much of that line that includes SaaS is. Is SaaS revenue and what is that growing? \nHans Vestberg: Yes. We don't disclose the SaaS revenue specifically. So yes.\nMatt Ellis: But overall, I mean it's not the largest part of that customer group you should be a fair assumption from.\nBrady Connor: Okay. And then what was the second part of the question, Frank? \nFrank Louthan: So with the gross adds that you're getting, are there any characteristics about these customers you're tracking that are maybe different from what they were say two years ago. And I'm curious about what you think about the long-term churn characteristics of customers you're tracking today, particularly given the heavier promotional activity that you've done versus what you did historically? \nHans Vestberg: In general, I think the churn characteristics all the new customers coming in is even better than before for many reasons as you said yourself. And then the type of customers I think Matt talked a little bit on the type of gross adds we're getting is new customers to Verizon, where they come in. And of course, we have opportunities to upgrade them, step up them and also having opportunities for our converged offerings. So really good quality of the customers coming in as Matt said, as well. So we feel really good about the growth momentum we have and the customers we are getting.\nBrady Connor: Yes. Thanks, Frank. Brad that's all the time we have today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}], "2025": [{"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 3, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-10-22 11:21:04", "content": "Brady Connor: Good morning. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Essex House and welcome to our event this morning, and for everybody on the webcast, thank you for listening in. We got a couple of items that I need to cover upfront first. And I'm missing the clicker. Is there a clicker? Okay, there we go. Safe Harbor statement. So, our presentation today contains things about statements that they are forward-looking and contain risks and uncertainties. Those are covered on our website with the Safe Harbor statement. A couple of items. Also, we had some non-GAAP disclosures or non-GAAP items in the presentation. The reconciliations of those are provided on the website. Next slide, please. And one administrative item for today, the camera is going to be focused on the stage during live Q&A. For the folks in the audience ask that you announce your name and your firm when called on for Q&A. With that, we're really excited for the content today. So let me hand it over to Hans and we'll get going. Hans?\nHans Vestberg: Good morning. And welcome to Verizon Third Quarter Earnings Call as well as a Broadband Update. Very happy to see so many in the room, but of course, also happy for everyone joining on the webcast. Let me kick this off. I'm going to -- we have an agenda that is pretty simple. I'm going to talk about the highlights of the third quarter, then we're going to do some -- a little bit of strategic updates and we're going to end up with Tony talking about the results and capital allocation. So, let me start by talking about the third quarter. And maybe before I start with the third quarter, just mentioning the hurricanes that has been going through our southern part of country and had devastating impacts. Verizon, of course, has worked tirelessly to see that our communications up, is so essential that communication is working for public safety, but also for the communities that are affected. Initially, in some of the states, we had challenges, especially with power, but I think that our team did a fantastic job to get our networks up pretty quickly. So, again, this is things that are happening constantly around the world right now in hurricanes and natural disasters. For us, building the networks, as we are always doing, is extremely important to see the resilience and on the network during this time. So, starting with that, talking a little bit about the results. I have a tie today. That means it's a good a good result. It is result. I'm really pleased with what I've seen them. I've talked to you so many times that there are years when you are a CEO where you're performing better than others. And I know that 2023 wasn't the highlight of my career at Verizon, [indiscernible] what we have done great job since then. Started in 2023 in the midyear of starting changing the products and all of that and then coming around where we are right now. Looking at the financial, growing 2.7% in the wireless service revenue is great. I'm also proud to report the biggest profit EBITDA in the history of Verizon, $12.5 billion in the quarter, which is really good and its multi-factors. And of course, the team sitting over there have done a great job. Proud of that. We continue to create good cash flow, $6 billion in the quarter, continue with a really strong cash flow generation as that is part of our measurement and how we measure ourselves. On the operational side, we started getting an even better balance on the postpaid side. We were 239,000 net adds positive. Sampath will talk about what happened in the consumer, but I already now going to tell him, he did a great job in the postpaid, but also in the prepaid. We were turnaround prepaid. We got a lot of questions over the years. Now we're around approximately 80,000 ex SafeLink. And of course, the business side did a great job on wireless again. Kyle and his team is consistently between 125,000 to 150,000 net adds every quarter, and I'm really pleased with that. The broadband side, I promised you now for quite a long time. As soon as I get into 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers, are going to come back to what we're going to do after that for slides down. I will talk about that. But first of all, I'm going to take a victory lap that we're 15 months ahead of the target we outlined when we bought the C-band with our fixed wireless access. Again, a great product, great work. At the same time, for the ones that remember, we were a little bit weaker on Fios in the second quarter because there was a little bit of movements in the market with ACP and all of that. Now we're back to normal again. The team is doing great work with Fios. All-in-all, a great quarter for broadband. And we continue with the private networks and the mobile edge compute. We announced two deals this quarter, but we had way more. FIFA and MSG, Madison Square Garden Group, all are buying private networks using our capabilities in dense areas to see that they can fulfill their fans or the customers' experiences. All-in-all, we feel good about the full year financial guidance that we gave earlier in the year. We even said, if you have read the press release, which I hope that all of you have done, that when it comes to the wireless service revenue and EBITDA, we are at midpoint or above on both of them for the full year. That's how good we feel about the performance so far in the year. That's what I have to say about the third quarter. Tony will come back and go a little bit deeper. If I then come in to talk a bit about the strategy. Some of this is given for you, for me, it's a journey where we are today. It's a long journey with a lot of things, and we are very organized structure company, what we're doing. The first phase, I call it sort of building the foundation. Some of you remember the heavy investment in fiber, the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, all of that was enormously important for today's work. I mean on the table in front of you have your consumer connection report. That's what we give out twice a year with all the stats what's happening in the network. Last time, we told you that our network, the last five years, grew 129%. If you haven't built it with our own fiber with the transport networks we have done and all these fundamentals that Kyle and Joe has built, we can't handle all these data and have the best network in the nation when it comes to wireless and broadband. So the fundamentals we did with go-to-market, with consumer and business is really paying off today. And you see it when our product has started resonating with the market is because we have Kyle and we have Sampath, both of them thinking about how to meet the customer demands and what the customer needs to have. So all-in-all, that was important. The second phase, all of you remember, we sold -- we bought a lot of assets. We sold everything in Verizon Media Group. We bought the TracFone that is paying off right now. We also bought the C-Band, enormously important you're going to hear Joe talking about the C-Band, but we all know where we deploy this C-Band, we have a great financial success and customer impact. So very important movements we did in that. But we also launched a lot of new products, fixed wireless access, myPlan, myHome and a lot of other things that we now have as the base going into 2025. And now we're also extending our TAM with a couple of larger investments we're doing all the way from Frontier, but also what we want to talk to in a second. So for me, this journey is now in a moment where we have the have the right assets. We have right the right team, and we have great products for our customers. Only the last, I would say, six months, we have done all of these strategic movements in order to strengthen ourselves to continue to be clearly the number one in the market and extending that. You have seen them all, the customer-first offerings we have done, resonating with our customer. We're going to hear Sampath talk about them. The refreshed brand we did in June, that takes time to get the impact, but we see the positive movement with a refreshed brand that is supporting our new products, really happy with that. And hopefully, some of you are looking at commercials, highly digitally, or on TV, and see how we're trying to recapture and rethinking the way we're showing up for our customers. We have the plan, Frontier acquisition. We talked about that in a separate session. We're excited about that and adding to our expanded TAM. We did a tower transaction just two seconds on that. Of course, this was cash in. But more importantly, we only do the deal when we can see a deal that's actually creating more \u2013 more opportunity for us, both by having a cost level that is predictable for us, very important. I like [Indiscernible] economics in the network; and second, also creating more competition in the market. We are suddenly creating with a strategic partner in Vertical Bridge, another strong partner in the market, giving more optionality and seeing that we can have a predictable cost for our tower leases, which is one of the few things we're not having 100% ownership on. We also yesterday, I think, announced that we're buying some spectrum US Cellular. It's going to take time until that's come into fruition because it's hanging on another acquisition. So I don't think it's going to be cash out until 2026. It's just adding capacity. It's a buy versus build in that region. So we're adding capacity there. And then we will not speak so much about AI today, but I hope you're going to add some questions to Kyle, because not only even efficiencies that Sampath is talking about in the customer care and personalization, we see with our compute storage, with our power and the mobile edge compute, we see great opportunities when it comes to AI and revenues for us. And we will talk a little bit about here, but we also do it in the future, coming back a little bit more structure and talk what we're doing. But we already right now see a good tractions on what we're doing on the front end of it. All in all, that's sums it up where we are today. I think we have an unmatched value proposition all the way from our best mobility, American's best mobile networks. We created a satellite partnership recently. We have myPlan, plus all the business and business offerings, strong offering. And then on the broadband side, all the way from Fios to fixed wireless access, we're now almost 12 million broadband customers, 11.9. The fixed wireless access are generating more than $550 million per quarter in revenue started three years ago. So we can see that we can build on this network, where we build the network once and we want as many profitable connections on top of it. It started paying off without. So we're uniquely positioned in the market with onerous economics. So all that said, we\u2019re already in the quarter, where are we going as a company? We know also that we hit sort of our targets on broadband. So we're going to talk today about what we're doing next. So our broadband targets going forward is basically going to say that we're going to double the fixed wireless access targets by 2028 to 8 million, 9 million fixed wireless access subscribers. Joe will talk a little bit what we're doing and how we continue, and I expect that Joe, our Head of Network continue to have capacity way beyond and continue to build for us so we are ready to capture this opportunity that were created. We also want to talk about our acceleration on Fios. We think that's a great opportunity for us to do that in this moment. We will, as we have closed the Frontier acquisition, have more than 30 million passings -- fiber passing. And we also see a clear path of somewhat to 35 million to 40 million passings after Frontier and what we're doing ourselves. And if you combine that with our fixed wireless access, I think in the future, we're going to cover more than 100 million households. So, clearly, the broadband, together with the mobility, together with our offerings, we are putting ourselves up to a possibility to continue to have sustainable growth on our service revenue, but also continue to expand our EBITDA and cash flow. And the ones that have been following us for time, you know those three all the things were measured on. Those are the three things that management are measured on. The Board has decided those are the three things that are actually driving the most shareholder value. And that's what we're focused on here right now. So, I will let my team now explain a little bit about where we are and how we're going to execute on these targets. And then we're going to hear Sampath and Tony talk about the financials and the situation. So by that, I'm going to hand over to Joe Russo.\nJoe Russo: Thank you, Hans. Appreciate it very much. Good morning everybody. The one thing I want to first say upfront is the is the network and technology team super confident that investments I'm going to talk about over the next few slides, coupled with the best engineers in the industry, is going to continue to deliver on the best, most reliable, highest performing networks for our customers and give that experience to more and more Americans across the country. It's easy to make claims about being the largest this or the fastest that, but that's not what my team and I are about. We're about building the best, most reliable networks. And that takes hard work and a lot of strategic investments that I'll talk a little bit about today. But that's hard work around testing and optimizing the network each and every day. It's strategic investments in things like generators and mobile assets for when there's emergencies. And this is why, as Hans said, following the Hurricanes Helena and Milton, the Verizon network outperformed rest of the industry, and I'm super proud that we were there when our customers and first-responders and businesses needed us the most. So, before I dive into the broadband plans, I first want to congratulate Kyle and Sampath for hitting our 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access target 15 months ahead of schedule. And that took a ton of work from a lot of people within the organization. But one of the things I'm very proud of from the network and technology team is that we built the coverage and capacity well ahead of schedule for them to deliver on that target. And as we look forward to the -- here we go. As we look forward to this new doubling of our fixed wireless access subscribers, my team's objective hasn't changed. It's to build the coverage and capacity well ahead of schedule and we're already doing that. We expect that to cover another 30 million homes over the next four years on our award-winning multipurpose network, we have to do a few things. The first is will take a mobility-first approach, and I'll talk more about that in a minute. But getting to 90 million homes and businesses covered with fixed wireless access will be accomplished with three key things we're doing today. The first is our aggressive deployment of C-Band and millimeter wave, we call ultra wideband. The second is a new MDU solution that's been in trial and we'll be rolling out in 2025 to serve MDUs with up to 1 gig Internet service with our millimeter wave technology. And the third is technology advances and the use of our vast small cell network in order to add even more ultra wideband coverage and capacity between now and 2028. So I'm going to shift gears a little bit to fiber. So I'm looking forward to the pending acquisition of Frontier and bringing these two great fiber assets together. The combined wireline footprint has approximately 48 million homes and businesses of which 25 million of those are already served with fiber. And I know one thing. With our 20-year experience in building fiber across this country, that we will continue to deploy Fios in the new footprint after closing. Post close, we will take the appropriate pace to build based on the following criteria. The first is the profitability of the build. The second is the competitive environment that we see that we're operating in. And the third is our capital allocation priorities. But over time, I want to be clear. My objective is to bring Fios to 35 million to 40 million homes across the country. So I want to bring the whole network strategy together for you. The first is, we built a shared multipurpose network with owners' economics to serve as many profitable connections as possible. That strategy is built on the foundation we call the Intelligent Edge Network, which is rooted in our rich fiber assets, both in the ultra long-haul network and in the metro networks across the country. It also encompasses our converged IP core and our own and operated Verizon Cloud platform and our mobile edge computing platform that serves both today's and tomorrow's technologies. This foundation gives my team and I the capability to provide that best, most reliable, highest performing network to two access technologies. The first is the radio access network. And again, as I mentioned, we take a mobility-first approach. What that means is I deploy coverage and capacity to enhance the mobile experience for our customers and to find new revenue streams. The good news is we pull through fixed wireless access when we do that. And as we've said, we've been awfully successful in that space. Customers just love that product. So we will be accelerating our ultra wideband deployment. I expect that by the end of this year, we'll have a -- we'll have covered 70% of our planned footprint and by the end of next year through acceleration, we will get to 80% to 90% of that planned footprint covered. We also have just recently launched our 100% virtualized 5G core network with stand-alone and slicing capabilities. And we'll talk a little bit more towards the end of this year, how we're going to put those to use in the market. And then finally, we are the only company in this country that's actually running virtualized RAN at scale. 40% of my C-Band sites are now virtualized in the network. Shifting over to fiber access network. So I've been building Fios for 20 years or so now. And we're on track this year to pass approximately 500,000 prems. Frontier, as you know, is on their way to pass 10 million prems by the end of 2026. And we are in 2025, targeting an expansion of our Fios build up to 650,000 prems. Post-close, I see that pace growing to up to 1 million plus prems per year. But what excites me more than anything, after 20 years of doing this, is our business case on Fios is getting better and better. And that starts with the fact that customers demand high-quality broadband services more now than ever. So what we see is when I do a build today, we see higher and faster penetration rates than we have with prior builds. And we pulled through mobility benefits on both churn and ARPU. But I'm also finding new and creative ways to bring down the cost of deploying fiber. And that comes in three big chunks. The first is partnerships with companies like Corning and CommScope, where they're delivering technology to do both reduction in the amount of fiber I have to deploy to serve homes and the techniques and technologies that make it easier for my team to deploy. The second is, we've made with Sean Carr\u2019s [ph] help, 20 years of systems and tools improvements through the whole process of building, designing, operating the network and we're seeing great benefits from those systems and tools enhancements in the reduction of rework, efficiency of our build and operating of the network. And then the third is, we've made some strategic decisions of how to get legacy costs out of our network without having to deploy fiber to the entire wire center. So I can use other techniques to move customers to new technologies and remove legacy equipment without having to deploy fiber across an entire footprint. But our network strategy is clear. To build and operate the best, most reliable, highest performing network to power and empower how our customers live, work and play. Let me leave you with this. My goal is to ensure more and more Americans have access to that best, most reliable network experience, by expanding the best mobile and broadband networks through a disciplined capital approach. We do that by building the best networks. And over time, that includes a 5G ultra-wideband network that will serve 300-plus million Americans with 5G advanced features for today's and tomorrow's technology. And a fixed wireless access and Fios network that will serve over a 100 million homes and businesses. So I'm going to turn it over now to Sampath, who will talk through how he'll ensure more customers get access to those great network experiences. Thanks, Sampath.\nSowmyanarayan Sampath: Joe, thank you. Very good morning to all of you. There are two things that Joe spoke about that really excites me. The first one is America's best wireless network continues to get bigger and even better. And the second one is our ability to offer broadband to 100 million homes and businesses over a period of time. So with that, let me get into how we go about this. Verizon is in a very unique position right now because we have two engines of growth: mobility and broadband. Both these segments, both these businesses have secular tailwinds, there's huge demand for both of the products. And more importantly, Verizon has a good position and a lot of opportunity to grow in front of it. Let's start with mobility. Look, in mobility, we are number one. If we look at our share position, our total revenue. And it starts with our postpaid business. We are seeing continued momentum in our postpaid business. With this quarter, we would have had seven quarters of consecutive year-on-year postpaid phone gross ad momentum that we have in the business. And why did that happen? Some of it has to do with our sales engine that we've gone and reengineered, get back to the local market structure, local sales incentives, local marketing. And the second is myPlan. myPlan, as I say, is on plan. Customers love it. They like the structure of it, they like the ability to get access to unique offerings and it's truly differentiated in the market. And you saw us, we had a strong quarter, 81,000 phone net adds in the space. We will be postpaid phone net add positive with second number, without second number, this year as well as promised in our plan to do that. Next, we turn our attention to our value business or prepaid. And we bought TracFone, we've integrated TracFone and we had really strong momentum in our business. We had 80,000 net add positive in our business, the best in many quarters, and a lot of that comes down to a core performance of our brands. We saw almost all our brands have very strong performance and momentum in this space. Two, our exclusive distribution with total wireless has scaled up really well, and you can see those stores everywhere. And third is our unique distribution position that we have within Walmart. And you're going to see continued progress and continued momentum in our value business going forward. That brings me to our third topic, which is churn. Now that we have our postpaid engine working well, our value turnaround in progress, I can turn my attention to the churn. There is nothing structurally that prevents Verizon from being an industry leader in retention and lower churn. We've been in that position before. We know how it feels. And more importantly, we know how we get there. In the short-term, we made some trade-offs, some strategic trade-offs that Hans and I feel very good about to drive shareholder value. We had some pricing actions that do drive some churn in this space. But on balance, we feel very good about how we executed those and often churn is way less than some of our business cases that had come in. The second is we are very disciplined about our retention spend. You see that in our upgrade numbers. We -- it has to be demand-led, customers have to want it, and we link our retention promotions the plans and the price plans that they have there. But over a period of time, you should expect lower churn from us from a couple of things. The first one is better experience. We are using AI significantly both at stores at our call centers. Second is myPlan and perks, as more and more and of our base gets into the myPlan construct and takes more perks that helps with churn. Third is myAccess or Verizon Access, our loyalty program, which I'll cover in a bit, that could give us traction in that. And then the last one, which is probably the biggest lever is going to be more mobile plus home customers. When those two customers come together, we see a huge reduction in churn, and that's going to apply to a larger base as we expand our broadband offering more piece. The fourth is margin accretive add-on services. In form of perks, in form of adjacent services, it's a continuous growth, and it's being very innovative every time we do that. We are taking the same approach we have to mobility to our broadband space. It first starts with momentum in sales. You saw that this quarter strong momentum in sales on Fios and FWA. Similar tactics, similar promotions. But the construct is that same momentum we have and the same energy we bring to our broadband business as well. myHome has been a very successful launch. A lot of our base tends to like the perks. They are taking on our new customers when they come on board, they take on perks, and they like the ability to share their perks between mobile and home. And also sustained growth in ARPU, when you build a long-term sustainable subscription business like we've done, you have to balance P&Q. Over a period of time, I've spoken about this 80-20 contribution to service revenue because that's the big measure we measure ourselves on is service revenue. I think with a positive four net add trajectory, strong FWA and Fios performance, we are on track to get to that 80-20 mix over a period of time. Now, we are in a very unique position. I think the only the only company, carrier, who has a scaled position in both FWA and in the fiber business. And both these are top products, when you combine them together you get access to 100 million homes and businesses in the country. No other carrier offers that amount of coverage and depth that we offer in terms of serving our customers. Let's dig into each of these one by one. The first is FWA. Joe just spoke about moving from 60 million to 90 million homes and businesses covered. But what's interesting about the FWA basis, it's a quality prime customer base. Our FICO score on FWA is north of 700. So it's a really strong customer base. And the reason is it's a high price value equation. There's a huge segment of the market who love that. And because of that, you see very high NPS scores. I mean think about it, you could finish this. You could go to a store in five minutes, buy it, and in 10 minutes after that, you could be in your apartment connected with the 5G Verizon FWA product. It's a huge competitive advantage. High NPS is a competitive advantage. Our pricing construct is a competitive advantage. We do not like promotions that roll off. You get a customer on one price point and in two years, you -- the price changes. It's annoys customer. And that's one of the reasons why it's a huge competitive advantage for us because we continue to lead with that. And then you have fiber. Joe spoke about 20 years. He's been working a little longer than 20 years in the fiber business. Look, we are the OG fiber players. Some people think it's a new thing. We've been in this thing for 20-plus years. And every year, we find that the new cohorts that we bring on have better penetration than some of our older cohorts even because we get better. Joe gets better with the build, we get better with selling it, we're targeting it, using digital to bear in those pieces to do that. But what's interesting is it's a white-glove experience. Very, very high NPS scores that we have, very low churn. And most, a majority of our customers who come and take our Gig Plus plan. Again, that's a competitive advantage around high NPS, high customer satisfaction. So over a period of time with 100 million premises covered, we have a differentiated offering. We have an offering that is steered. We have an offer that is segmented. FWA and fiber, and customers will choose. At the end of the day, we want customers to choose what's right for them, and we're going to be very transparent on what the pricing is and what the value prop is to grow that. And talking of value prop, I want to spend some time talking about the Verizon model of convergence. The Verizon model of convergence is margin accretive. It is revenue accretive and has very attractive ROIC. And at the end of the day, it is demand led. I do not believe in giving away one product to sell the other, or giving away one product to hold on to the other. We think we have the best wireless network. We have best broadband offering. Customers want it and they're willing to pay a very fair price for it. We do have some advantages for a customer when they take both of those products together. But at the end of the day, it is demand-led, because customers want to buy the best from both us to do that. Now let me talk a little bit about how this convergence comes to life. How convergence comes to life? The first one, as you see on the page, is myHome and myPlan. It's -- we launched both, and it's not a coincidence that both the offerings look very similar. You buy a base connectivity and then you have access to these really unique books. I mean, it's becoming a pretty big business for us and customers can share perks across both those plans. The second is our app. My Verizon app, we have a single app now for both for mobility and home. So once you get a mobility customer, they see a home piece and they can try out the home and they can buy the home and then vice versa to do that. And also home Wi-Fi can control everything in a single app and it does very well. The third thing is transparent pricing. It is very clear to customers what their savings are. And we're going to keep innovating in this space. Because at the end of the day, customers want the best product, but they also want clear pricing upfront, and we do that every single time with our constructs that we have there. Fourth is distribution. We have a large distribution of stores and a digital footprint. And you can see over a period of time, we are able to distribute our Fios offering through our store network as well, and that's a huge upside to the business case. So you see that we are building the Verizon model of convergence, which is demand-led and it's accretive to us. But where does the value come for Verizon and its shareholders? Two big buckets, revenue. The first one is we will see penetration well north of 40% in our business. And as I said, every new cohort that we bring in actually gets to that a little faster than the previous cohort we do that space. And once we do that, once we acquire Frontier, and when we close on Frontier, we will we will have that as well. And then as Joe builds out new networks, we will see similar penetration levels as we do that. The second is, in some of our big markets where we have fiber, our wireless market share is 500 basis points or 5% better than if we don't have fiber. So we can cross-sell mobility to our Frontier base when we close it, to our new cohorts of fiber that are coming in, but also customers who have access to fiber, but don't have fiber today, we'll be able to cross-sell them. So two revenue upside opportunity for us as we build out our converged offering. The second is churn. A couple of data points. We see a 50% reduction in mobility churn when we bundle with fiber. And that's a huge lever for us, even broader, longer term on how we take churn down in the space. The second is a fiber churn, which is already world-class, one of the best in the world, will go down another 40% when we bundle mobility and fiber. That's a very unique position for us, and we see churn benefits on FWA as well. So what we are essentially building here is one of the world's best franchises for broadband, with FWA as well as with fiber, with best-in-class metrics. But more importantly, it's demand-led, and that's the Verizon model of convergence. Talking about demand led, a lot of the reason it's demand-led actually comes from our unique value prop. Let me start with this. The bottom of layer is our connectivity layer. Best network. Joe always says, we will be the most reliable network. That's where our value comes from. It's the same network we have for broadband, for postpaid, through myPlan and our prepaid value brands as well. And we keep tiering these. We have segments that go after it. And over a period of time, we'll have new sources of revenue. Let me touch on two of these. The first is network slicing. It's a new currency. It's something that you should -- we should talk a little more about soon. And that will have upside opportunity for us. Second is satellite connectivity. That's another new form of connectivity and then new ways to monetize our overall connectivity network. Then on top of that, you get to our entertainment and adjacent services. We call them perks, because you have to be a Verizon customer to get them. That's the perk you get for being a Verizon customer. And we right now have seven million perk subscriptions on our network. And then guess what, they're going to double by 2025. So we have a large revenue stream that customers find very compelling. It reduces churn for us and is very margin rich for us. So it covers a lot of pieces for us. And we're not stopping still. We're going to keep innovating. But to be on our network to be part of perks, it's going to have to be compelling. It's going to have to be exclusive to Verizon and something our customers want and they can save money with it. On top, we have our loyalty program. Verizon Access or if you're a customer, it's just myAccess because it's your access, because it gives you access to two things. One is always on deals to some of the best premium brands out there. But second is once in a lifetime, my kids call it bucket list type opportunities they have. For example, you can sky dive with the bronchos, or you can go to London to watch the Jacksonville Jaguars. Or we can actually toss the kind for the opening game. These are once-in-a-lifetime events for NFL, NHL, NBA and some of the best musical acts out there. I don't know if you can get tickets for Taylor Swift, but definitely check in on the Verizon myAccess plan to do that. As I wrap up, I want to leave you with two thoughts. The first is we at Verizon right now, have two engines for growth. Two engines that have secular growth in front of them, two engines that have tailwinds and where we have unique market position but huge opportunity as well. You're going to see us do the Verizon model of convergence, which is demand-led, which is give customers choice, be transparent about pricing and offer them a huge set of services on top of that. We're going to deepen our relationship with our customers and extract value for them and for ourselves in the process. The second is, over the last seven quarters, you've seen our vision and execution on the business. You're going to give a lot of confidence you're going to get from that that we will execute on that for our mobility business, our broadband business and the Verizon converged business. With that, I'm going to pass it over to Tony talk about two things; 3Q update and more importantly, capital allocation. Tony take it away.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks, Sampath and good morning. So our execution, as Sampath said is really strong, and it's fueling the momentum in our business. Our third quarter results, before we get into it, I do want to talk about the third quarter. Our ability to demonstrate customer growth and financial growth once again is a hallmark to our testament of execution day in and day out. And we delivered the highest ever reported adjusted EBITDA in our quarter. We're on track, as Hans mentioned, with our 2024 guidance, and at/or above the midpoint of our guided range for both wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA. If I go to the operational metrics from mobility, if you think about business and consumer, gross add and churn both improved year-over-year and that drove phone net adds of 239,000 in the third quarter. That's a significant improvement year-over-year. And as Sampath mentioned, we expect the consumer business to have positive postpaid phone net adds for the full year, and that's with and without the second number offering. And that's in addition to the continued strength in phone net adds from our business segment, and that's quarter after quarter of strong growth. If you think about broadband, we have almost 12 million subscribers in our base, and Fios and FWA are both growing. On broadband, we had 389,000 net adds in the quarter. That's another strong quarter for us. And inside of that, if you think about FWA, we've grown our FWA subscriber base over 1.5 million in that time period. And as you heard from the team today, there's much more opportunity for us to expand further. If we move to the financials, Hans talked about how we're measured, service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. If I start with service revenue, our service revenue is very healthy. Our wireless service revenue was up 3.1% year-to-date or $1.8 billion. Our EBITDA continues to be strong. And even in a quarter where we delivered a very strong $12.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, we took actions around revenue and cost efficiencies to set us up for 2025. That strong EBITDA led to free cash flow of $14.5 billion year-to-date, and that's consistent with the prior year. And that includes an increase of $2.5 billion in cash taxes. The cash generation of the business continues to be very strong, and we have ample flexibility and funding to execute on our capital allocation priorities. The business is performing well, and we have good momentum as we close 2024 and head into 2025. And if I shift over to capital allocation, as many of you know, we have four capital allocation priorities and they remain unchanged. Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business. And that includes investments in our network infrastructure. If you think about C-Band, if you think about Fios, it includes M&A to accelerate our strategy. If you think about the pending acquisition of Frontier, and it also includes being opportunistic with wireless spectrum as evidenced by the deal we signed last week with US Cellular. As we said before, we're back to BAU levels of capital spend, and we're on track with our 2024 capital program. If we look ahead to 2025 in terms of guidance for 2025, we expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion for the next year. And that's an all-in number that includes all of our growth initiatives. So that includes C-Band and the continuation of rolling out C-Band. Joe talked about having 80% to 90% of our sites on C-Band by the end of 2025. It includes our Fios continued open-for-sale expansion up to 650,000 new open for sale on Fios. And it includes the broadband MDU solution, the multi-dwelling solution that Joe mentioned. All of these things are included in that 17.5 to 18.5 number. And that range gives us the flexibility to both invest for growth and be disciplined and efficient with our capital spend. Our second priority is our commitment to the dividend. And as you've seen recently, we've raised dividend for the 18th consecutive year. That's an accomplishment we're extremely proud of. And as we said many times, our goal is to put the Board a position for further dividend increases. Our third capital allocation priority is having a strong balance sheet. We've made significant progress delevering the balance sheet since the acquisition of C-Band. As of the of the end the third quarter, our unsecured leverage stands at 2.50 times. That's the ratio of net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our focus is to continue to pay down debt between now and the closing of the Frontier deal. And today, we're announcing an update to our long-term leverage target of 2.0 to 2.25 times. Given our cash flows and overall financial strength, this is the appropriate range for our business to provide flexibility to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. Our fourth capital allocation priority is share buybacks. And as we've said many times, we will consider share buybacks but our unsecured leverage metric reaches 2.25 times, and that target is unchanged. As we work towards that target, we continue to focus on generating strong cash flows and paying down debt. Our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and deliberate. And as you've seen from our track record, we'll continue to focus on operational execution and performance and deliver on our commitments. We're excited about the opportunities we have ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to Hans.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. Let me summarize updates before we come to Q&A. I think you hopefully got a feeling that we are setting us up well for 2025 and beyond to continue the leadership in this market and extend it. So we talked about the networks that we're building. It should be the best and the best performing. I think that's been a focus. And really now with the C-Band coming quickly and our Fios build-out, we feel really good about it. It's been important for us to focus the last couple of years on the differentiated value proposition for our customers. We know that there are more important services than ever. To have mobility and broadband is a necessity for every organization, every person on this planet and in the United States. The differentiating offerings that we're doing are enormously important, and they come from deep research what our customer really wants. And of course, together with a refreshed brand should support us for the continuation. Tony talked about capital allocation, and you have seen us being very prudent by the capital allocation. We promised to come down to BAU levels, we're on BAU levels. We have the high [indiscernible] C-band because we saw a great opportunity to quickly come out with that, and that were coming down. We're now doing investment to expand our total addressable market with the same offering, the same network. That's the strategy we have. We stay there and we see that we can continue to grow well and continue to create profitability and cash flow. So that's the overall strategy. And we are measured on three things: the wireless service revenue, the adjusted EBITDA and the cash flow. And we are very committed, the whole team here to continue to grow the service revenue and expand the EBITDA and cash flow going into 2025 and onwards with the investments we're doing right now and where we stand with our strategy, where we stand with our assets and we stand with our offering. So all in all, we feel very positive where we are right now. We feel positive where the market is and our products. By that, I'm going to close, and we're going to have a open Q&A. Brady will help us to manage that. I have my whole management team here, and we even have a pictures on them, if you don't know who they are. They are sitting to the left here for the ones on the webcast. You can see them here. So they are all here. So I'm going to diligently distribute answers to them. Probably going to take some myself. Any questions you might have for us. Brady going to do it, remember, present yourself when you're going to answer, so the webcast audience know who is asking the question.\nA - Brady Connor: Okay. So I love the folks in the front row, but we're going to go back right to start with Simon. And again, just please announce your name and firm and since you're not on the camera.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks very much. Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Hans, I was interested in your latest thoughts on the BEAD program. You're clearly leaning into broadband. We're starting to see some of the states open up their processes. So how do you think about that as an opportunity beyond this? And then the other question would be around these markets like the Northeast where you have fixed wireless and fiber. How do you start to bifurcate that opportunity? Because I think in the past, if you had fiber, you hadn't really done fixed wireless. But does that start to blend a bit?\nHans Vestberg: I'm going to take some help from Joe later on, but I'm going to start myself first. The BEAD program is, of course, contemplated in everything we have here. In the Fios footprint, it's obvious we will go for it when it makes sense for us, both from a return on investment. And so we -- in our Fios footprint, there's going to be great opportunities for us for sure, and we will be active on it. On the second one, when it comes to fiber or Fios versus fixed wireless access, I think -- I hope that you heard from Joe our strategy on fixed wireless access is a secondary business case on mobility. So we -- first of all, we deploy our C-Band for mobility. And the agreement that Joe and I have in the whole team is that we build mobility for two reasons: revenue generation as well as customer satisfaction. And then we get a secondary fixed wireless access opportunity. So it's not really thinking about where we do Fios or we do fixed wireless access. We do Fios and we do mobility. Then we create opportunities. And -- and I always love what we are doing because we give optionality for our customers. There are customers that just kills to get Fios. But there's others that really feel that fixed wireless access is a solution they want to have because of simplicity. So we're going to create optionality. And you saw the consumer slide that Sampath showed with customer offering framework, I think it's called, where actually everything is in the same model, regardless of what it takes. So that's how we think about it. Do you want to add something? Yes, you want to add something. Please come up here.\nJoe Russo: Okay. Yeah. Just on BEAD. So we've built a very good process for managing subsidies. And we've been already receiving and winning subsidies in our Fios footprint. So as BEAD starts to get deployed, we'll deploy those same kind of standards and processes to participate. When I think about the 35 million to 40 million, it will be a very, very small percent that we think is BEAD. And we foresee that getting 35 million to 40 million will be with or without BEAD funding.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. Next?\nBrady Connor: Okay, we're going to work our way up. I'm going to go a second row. We'll go Hodulik on the end over here.\nJohn Hodulik: Thank you. I don't think you would see me behind these tall guys. First, starting with fixed wireless. Thank you guys on the new targets. Just on the quick math, it seems like the cadence is slowing a bit. You guys are doing like 360 -- 360,000 a quarter. It looks like that slows to just sort of doing it ratably to under 300,000. I just want to make sure if that's sort of what we should expect to see or if there's something different in the numbers? And then these new initiatives are great. You guys did 1.7% service revenue growth this quarter. Obviously, you don't want to give 2025 guidance -- full guidance here, but should we expect an acceleration in service revenue growth from these new issues?\nHans Vestberg: On the future guidance, I'm going to leave that to Tony. On the first question, I'm going to start. I think to some extent, you're right. So think about this, we have had a target to create and get between 350,000 to 400,000 new broadband subscribers every quarter. And I think we've had that, but I'm not sure how many quarters. Sometimes up to 400, sometimes a little bit north of 350. What is happening right now is two things. First of all, the fixed wireless access is going into in a second sort of transformation because the C-Band is not going to suburban and rural. And of course, the opportunity is equally big, but the density is way less. So, we're going to see for a while that OFS, it's going to be a little bit less. And the second one is, as we're ramping up the Fios. You saw that we are doing some 450 to 500, going to 650 is a ramp-up. So, in the short-term, I think you're going to be in the lower end of that 350. And then I think when you see the ramping up of both of them, you're going to see a little bit different. So, I wouldn't say that we have changed anything on the pace. It's just a technicality of how we build right now and how we're ramping up Fios and actually going suburban to rural with our C-Band. So, those are the things. Tony, do you want to talk about guidance 2025 now?\nTony Skiadas: Sure.\nHans Vestberg: Great. I'm eager to hear.\nTony Skiadas: Hey John, thanks for the question. So, look, as we said we said this morning, we're on track with our service revenue, and we said we'd be at or above the midpoint on service revenue. If we think about next year, I'm not going to guide on 2025 right now. But in terms of puts and takes, we've taken a lot of actions to position ourselves for sustained growth. So, that includes the P&Q that you heard from Sampath, so volume improvements in pricing, and it also includes fixed wireless access, and you see the great growth that we've seen on fixed wireless access. Prepaid, has now, Sampath mentioned, turned positive. So, that's been a headwind this year. We would expect that to start to turn next year. We're still facing headwinds with program amortization. So, those are the puts and takes as we head into next year, and we'll bring it back to you in January.\nJohn Hodulik: Right. Thanks guys.\nHans Vestberg: Next.\nBrady Connor: We're working our way up to the front row. We're going to go -- we'll go Barden here on the end, the first tall person.\nDave Barden: You don\u2019t have to sound so excited about that Brady. Dave Barden from Bank of America. Thanks Hans. So, if my base case is that the tax regime remains the same. Cash tax is going up. CapEx is going up. Working capital, if the iPhone becomes a bigger thing, it's not going down, it might go up.\nHans Vestberg: A lot of assumptions here, continue.\nDave Barden: Those are -- not so much assumptions. And then you're going to do the Frontier deal and they're not free cash flow positive. So, is the message financially to you and Tony that 2024 is the high watermark for free cash flow at Verizon because it doesn't seem like there's a lot of dials to turn to kind of make it get a lot better. And the second question, if I could, would be there's some agitators at Frontier that want you guys to pay a higher price, bid against yourselves in that process. And you spoke a lot about how important it is to have this 100 million homes passed and the Verizon version of convergence. What are you willing to do to get that deal done?\nHans Vestberg: Okay, I'll leave the capital allocation for you, but I think that, of course, you can always find headwinds. We have a lot of -- or tailwinds as well in cash flow, and we will be very focused on that. So, I will let Tony go through the puts and takes on that. On the Frontier deal, I mean, first of all, if you have read the proxy, which you probably have done, it was a competitive process. We were asked for a best and final. We gave the best and final. We have a signed agreement and a contract for a merger. Now it is up to Frontier's shareholders to make the vote. We always have different type of strategies. We will continue to have that. This fitting in well right now. We're going to see what's going to happen, but we feel really confident that this is fair and good for all stakeholders. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Hey Dave, so we're not going to guide on free cash flow, but a few things. I mean, the same puts and takes that we shared at the beginning of the year still remain intact. So, see the EBITDA growth, and that's the focus for next year. Interest, in terms of deleveraging, we'll have to see where rates go. That will have an impact. And then cash taxes, as you mentioned, they're up this year. We'll have to see what happens on the legislative front. They're going to be up -- we said $2.5 billion so far this year. We'll see where that goes. And working capital, we're not seeing a big upgrade cycle right now. The upgrades were down 10%. Right now, customers are choosing to hang on to their phones a lot longer, and that's by choice. The average upgrade rate, and Sampath can correct me, but it's probably 40 months or so. So that hasn't changed. So we're going to continue to stay disciplined and segmented in our approach and then we'll come back on our thoughts on cash flow back in January. Thanks.\nBrady Connor: I'm going front row over here to Peter next.\nPeter Supino: Hi thanks, Brady. Thanks, Hans. Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. A question on fiber. And really about the rate of expansion, your target plus a lot of other publicly available targets and the guestimate about how many private fiber passings there are in the country summed over 100 million homes. Population density observations, nobody has perfect information, lead us to think that maybe you should be in a hurry to build as many homes as you can. And yet your current velocity of expansion is still much slower than other -- a couple of other companies. Wondering, how you think about the speed at which you want to pursue the targets that you laid out here today? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I think about broadband, that's the thinking I have, and team has that as well. That means that we include both our Fios, as well as the fixed wireless access as broadband solutions. And as you have seen lately, they are doing well, both of them. And that's how we think about our customers, and we create optionality. So, I that nobody else is building on the pace that we are doing in the combination of it. That's how are we thinking. And remember, we build the network once. And then at the edge of network, we decide what type of connections we have. Sometimes it's Fios, sometimes it's 4G, sometimes its 5G, something is fixed wireless access, and then we get the best return on investment on the invested capital because we do it one. So that's the thinking we have, and that's how we serve our customers. So I feel good about the pace we have and how we're deploying this again with the financial mind in behind it to see that we get the best return on investment for our shareholders. Anybody want to add something to that? Okay, then you don't need to. Next?\nBrady Connor: Come back in the middle of the room here, we'll do Jim and then Sebastiano.\nJim Schneider: Thanks. Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of quick questions on the network side, if I could. First is on -- just in terms of the longer term, the fixed wireless targets, do those sort include or not include any dedicated spending purely for fixed wireless? I know you said it's mobility-led, but does it of that? And talk about the part of that, which is small sales, if any? And then maybe tactically for 2025, can you maybe talk about the drivers of the CapEx increase. How much of that increase is coming on the wireless side on macro cells? How much of that is coming from fiber, et cetera? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: On the first question is no, there's no success-based fixed wireless access in the plan that we're presenting today. That's an optionality we have for the future. Right now, again, believe in our design principles because that makes the operation easier. It makes it easier for our customer, it makes it better for capital. That doesn't exclude it in the future that we will have success-based fixed wireless access. And then of course, I'm sure that Joe is building more capacity. So Kyle and Sampath has an opportunity to leverage on that. But in this plan, it's mobility first in all our C-Band. The second question is about the increase or the BAU level you have right now, how much is macro? You heard about what we said. We were trying to go to 80%, 90% of our planned radius having C-Band. And then you see the Fios up to 650. I think those are two important ones. There are other things coming down to some extent in our normal build because we have sort of come pretty far on the 4G, and we see much more traffic on the 5G. We have gone very far on our small cell with millimeter wave that is capturing a lot of our traffic in dense areas. That's a little bit smaller today. That doesn't mean we don't believe in it. We think it's super important. So I think those are the puts and takes in the CapEx. Joe?\nJoe Russo: I'll just add on small cells, and I mentioned it during, but we started probably about six months ago now deploying C-Band on small cells and have seen really good success with putting that technology on our vast small cell network, giving us more coverage and certainly more capacity for both mobile and fixed wireless access. So my view is that will continue in this four-year build program. As we'll leverage what we've done both with our millimeter wave small cells, and we had a pretty significant small cell network even for the 4G network. Leveraging now C-Band on those has really proven to be a great tool to add coverage and capacity.\nHans Vestberg: And one other thing that is increasing, which you mentioned was, of course, the MDU solution we have now for fixed wireless access, using millimeter wave. We have talked about it. We're going to put that in commercial use in next year. So that's, of course, also an opportunity, but of course, with a great return on investment.\nBrady Connor: Sebastiano, and then we'll go up here front row to Greg.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi. Sebastiano Petti, JPMorgan. I guess just following up on Jim and kind of Dave's question as well, but help us think about the shape of CapEx over the next several years because the 17.5 billion on a stand-alone basis, I guess, 17.5 billion to 18.5 billion includes the MDUs, the ultra wideband build as well as the 650...\nHans Vestberg: It's a range between 17.5 and 18.5.\nSebastiano Petti: Yes. Yes. So within that range, is there any maybe perhaps milestones or things like that, that are more elevated next year that that begin to peel off like the MDU or the ultra wideband build, should we think about it as being more steady state over the next several years?\nHans Vestberg: As I said, I think that this is a BAU level that we have in a steady state. I'm not going to guide for future years. I always said that if we see an opportunity where we can grow faster and we can invest more in CapEx, we will explain that if we go outside the normal BAU levels. Right now, we don't see that. Remember, we have talked about, there's no auctions for spectrum coming out at the moment. Usually, that is triggering or new. We don't even think 6G is in any of the plan of records we have right now. So it's a lot of things that usually catapult the higher investment level. We don't see them right now. So BAUs this level we are right now 17, 17.5 up to 18.5, that's where we're going to spend it. But ultimately, if we see opportunities, remember the capital allocation priorities, we spend it in business, but we also want to explain that is something additionally we can get and that we can share with our shareholders. But right now, the BAU levels are what you see from us right now. The big triggering events that you sometimes have, it's going to going to come 5G, its go spectrum auction. I don't have visibility of anything on that at the moment.\nSebastiano Petti: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe one for Sampath. I mean what underlies the confidence as we think about the 80/20 service revenue growth and the sustainability of, I guess, the volume side of the equation as you think about maybe tougher comps on the gross add side, the EIP dynamics and help us maybe think about the levers of sustained consumer volumes?\nSowmyanarayan Sampath: Yeah. Look, I think it comes back -- we've had seven quarters of strong gross add year-on-year growth coming into this. And all the efforts that we've put in, whether it's local marketing, going back to market structure, sales incentive, myPlan, just better execution on the ground, we continue to see gross add improvement in our business going forward. So I think that's a machine that we've gotten back to the right phase, and you're to see continued growth in that. The second comes down to churn. As I mentioned, there's nothing structurally that prevents us from getting back to leadership position on customer retention and churn. We made some short-term strategic trade-offs, which are the right things to do. But over a period of time, churn will start coming down, mobile plus home offerings, converged offerings is probably the biggest lever that we have there. But then myPlan, some of our loyalty programs and then just better execution on the churn piece as well. So you're going to see both things coming in, continued progression on gross add momentum and then better churn. When you put both of them together, that's how we're going to sustain a net add growth over period of time to do that. The second is on the price side. Look, we've had four or five price increases depending on how you count it over the last years. And in every case, the churn has been less than what we thought coming in. So customers like our product, they our offering, and you're going to see continued ways in which we can earn the trust of customer. The last one is there is another type of price increase, which has earned price increase. If you look at the chart where I had the customer offering framework, we are able to upsell our customers, upsell them on the type of plans, but also upsell them on perks and other things. We have seven million perks in our business right now. That's going to double this time next year. So you're going to see a lot of momentum on the price side just by our ability to earn those price-ups that we have. So a combination of gross adds, better churn and also ability to upsell our customer both on connectivity and some of the other offerings that we have. When you put all of that in, I get really comfortable about the LG20 [ph] framework that we laid out, that we are going on the right path to get there.\nSebastiano Petti: Good. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, we're going to go Greg [ph] in the front row over here, and then we'll start mixing around.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sure. Thanks. Another CapEx question, but more situated on the B2B opportunity. One of your peers has been putting out a few press releases on GenAI fiber. And you have a lot of fiber, both in footprint and from the One Fiber build and Jaunt XR acquisition. So I'm just curious on your latest thinking on the economics and the opportunities there.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I think I'm going to ask Kyle to comment on that. If we talk about the GenAI opportunities, I talked about a three-pronged GenAI strategy we have. We have employee experience improvements right now already in the market when it comes to call agents, et cetera. We have our personalization for customers. And then we have our revenue opportunity. And as I alluded to, given the assets we have in our network, we see great opportunities for having a chance to earn business there, which we've already done. But maybe, Kyle, you can talk a little bit more about it.\nKyle Malady: As you rightly bring up, the investments we've made before and say One Fiber and all the other fiber and all the CEOs and everything we've done, we're kind of reimagining those assets right now is how do we -- and how we can sell into this. And actually, right now, we're already selling into it. We're getting a lot of good orders from hyperscalers either on dark [ph] fiber or lit [ph] and we're going to see that growing. But we have more than that, not just the fiber, it's the power space and cooling, which you know is in really high demand. And we have a lot of latent assets in that area. So at the moment, we're putting it together. We're kind of -- I talked to somebody before, we're going to measure twice and cut once. We're not -- we're figuring out exactly how we're going to go into this market. It's a huge market. We can't cover it all, but there are certain segments we might be better off in than others, and that's -- we'll be back to you pretty soon talking to you about it. It's a great opportunity for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks.\nA \u2013 Brady Connor: Okay. We're going to go over here. We're going to go Brandon, and then Mike Rollins.\nQ \u2013 Brandon Nispel: Thanks. Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. I was hoping you could maybe unpack the fixed wireless targets in the homes passed from the perspective of maybe a proportion of MDUs versus single-family, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 markets and percentage of millimeter wave versus C-Band?\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: That's a lot of unpacking in that one. I'm not sure Joe you want to do it or something. But of course, we -- as I said before, the C-Band deployment goes to suburban and ruling because we started in the urban areas because that's where we got the spectrum first. That's another opportunity. It's a great opportunity, but less density. So I think that's one thing that's happening. The MDU is just adding to coming back to some of the places with dense areas where we can do the MDU solution. So I think it's a combination of them all. I'm not sure it's a special distribution or something if somebody wants to -- we just deploy our technology from a mobility point of view, and then get all the opportunities around it. Again, there's no success based sort of CapEx here for fixed wireless access, which comes along with everything else we're doing. But again, it's a great investment. Mobility is performing better when we have C-Band, both from churn and from step-ups and then we will fixed wireless access. So it makes all the sense for us to deploy it in the right way where we find the revenue, and that's what Joe is doing. Anything else you want to add? Are you sure. Okay. I understand the question, but this is sort of -- we have the framework and our plan of record, how we're deploying this, and it comes along with that. And then both Kyle and Sampath are selling into those open for sale that is coming out from either MDUs or from the C-Band deployment.\nQ \u2013 Mike Rollins: Thanks. Mike Rollins from Citi. I wanted to follow up on this question, but maybe in a different way. So the mobility first is going to take ultra-wideband to 80% to 90% of population and presumably households by end of next year and maybe 90-plus percent over time, but the FWA target is roughly like 60% of homes. What holds that percentage back relative to the 90% plus? And what would be the catalyst to try to unlock that additional 30 points of penetration? And then just a second question, if I could. When you look at building fiber and the team mentioned some of the progress in building and dynamics, what's the base case for penetration and ARPUs from the fiber builds, let's say, over a five-year period?\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: On the first one, I assume my team always want to beat the targets. We give you one target, the team is working to really beat and do it better and faster. You saw what we did last time, we said 4 million to 5 million. We beat that target with 15 months. So I think the team and are building ahead. So, but right now that's a target. It's always a time lag from when you deploy the technology and when you get the revenue and the subscribers. So I guess those are two questions. On the second question, Sampath, I think you can answer on that. You can answer on the first one if you want to correct me.\nA \u2013 Sowmyanarayan Sampath: No, I will not do that today.\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: Okay. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Sowmyanarayan Sampath: Look, on the second, the way you think about first is penetration. Just have been in this business for 20 years. We'll see penetration well north of 40% in our space as we do that space. I think now get more comfort because we'll have more mobility to bear into that space as well. So well north of 40% penetration, we do that. But the second thing we are seeing is every new cohort that we bring in to the market tends to have better one-year penetration than the previous cohort. So it gives us more confidence that -- and you would think when we get to the end of our build, you're getting to the less attractive, but that's not the case. Our first year penetration is actually better this year than it was last year and other. Some has to do with the way we market and the way Joe and my team work together to pre-sell some of that capacity to do that. In terms of ARPU, I know we don't report a specific broadband ARPU number. But look, we tend to do very well. We are industry-leading. If you look at Frontier's ARPU numbers, we'll have continuous growth on top of that because we will -- our customers on broadband sit in the myHome framework, where they come, they buy the connectivity piece. And look, majority of our customers take the 1 gig plus plan coming in. So that gives us a boost in ARPU. And then we start selling perks and other adjacent services on top of that. So we'll see good comfortable ARPU growth with a 1 gig plus plan, ARPU growth on that and the north of 40% penetration pretty much across our fiber footprint as well. Thank you. Next.\nBrady Connor: Okay. Let's go. We're going to go Frank back here in the back row, and then we'll come back up to Tim in the front row over here.\nFrank Louthan: Okay. Great. Frank Louthan with Raymond James. So on the fixed wireless, what is sort of the outlook for that on the business side? Is -- are those 8, 9 -- 8 million, 10 million subs include business, Type 2 replacement, you comment on that? And then getting to 35 million or so homes passed with wireless, is a pretty high percentage. Can you get there without additional M&A? Or does that include BEAD or other government subsidy?\nHans Vestberg: The second one doesn't include any M&A. And besides the one we have planned that you have announced. And B, as Joe said, there's no -- there's small pieces that will not rock the boat. We will make our numbers, regardless or BEAD or not. We will, of course, participate in BEAD that we can do. On the business side, those are in the number 8 to 9, yes, business side is included. And I have to say one of the things that Kyle and I are more surprised than others is, of course, the success we have had on the business side. Maybe you should talk about it on fixed wireless access on the business side, Kyle.\nKyle Malady: Listen, Frank, thanks for question. We continue to see this as a great opportunity, like I said before. We actually did a little bit better with this product than we thought we might. And what's interesting is enterprises, small businesses are figuring out different ways to use this connectivity. It's just not for broadband like you would see in a consumer world. So we think people are going to continue to innovate with it. And so this new -- these new open for sales that Joe and his team are putting together for us, we feel we can accelerate and really sell into this thing. I'm also excited about the -- what you hear about the using millimeter wave for MDU. A lot of these MDUs also have stores or businesses in them. And so we'll be able to leverage that investment as well to increase our market share in this area. So a lot of work to do, but \u2013 but we're really happy with the plans that Joe has put out for us to sell into.\nHans Vestberg: And a good thing from a sort of a utility point of view, many of the customers that Kyle have, they are using the fixed wireless access on certain hours. The consumers are another hour. So this is just using the utility even better that we can sell it in and we can monetize all hours of the day with our network. Next.\nBrady Connor: Come up here to Tim in the front row.\nTim Horan: Thank you. Tim Horan, Oppenheimer. We're seeing pretty unprecedented improvements in technology across the board, satellite, AI, what you're talking about, you would stand alone. Can these be material drivers to the business model, both maybe just talk a little bit about incremental revenue from all of these and maybe the ability to use AI to automate and digitize a lot more. And I guess -- and specifically, you satellite direct to phone, direct to mobile. Can that be a real needle mover in terms of overall growth rates for the company?\nHans Vestberg: I think AI is definitely over a time frame. So how kind and I think about AI, generative AI especially, in the beginning right now, we see large language modules going to the big data centers out to the market all the time. As soon as they're going to be an application that you're going to use as an enterprise, you're going to put it much closer. For the main reason of the transport cost for privacy, for security and in some cases, also latency, maybe not equally much. But then you're going to see a big opportunity for us, given what Kyle talked about. And we will come back a little bit more specific on it, but definitely. But it's going to take some time from all these large language models to be real products and sitting in the edge of the network. So that's clear. Slicing is another area we talked about. We believe that we will probably start more in the business side and then we'll come to the consumer side and that we see as an opportunity as well. On the satellite, a little bit too early to see how large opportunity can be, I have to say, because, of course, we want to offer satellite to our customers in the white spaces, we are not allowed to build, for example, and see a direct device. A little bit too early on the consumer side to see if that's a business case. On the business side, yes, we can see that already for remote enterprise or things like that. So those three are new revenue opportunities on top of everything we've talked about in.\nBrady Connor: Okay. We're doing fine on time. So we're going to get to everybody to just be patient. So we're going to go front row with Walt very here.\nWalt Piecyk: Walt Piecyk from LightShed. So the 2% to 3.5% growth you had historically, there was a lot of doubts whether Sampath is going to deliver on the units. Obviously, it's going to come down in the fourth quarter, but it looks like the Q of the P&Q is happening, just had a price increase, which should accelerate the postpaid growth in the fourth quarter at a time when people are concerned about the economy, right? So you've got -- it seems like some decent strength there. Now you're investing in fiber, you're investing in fixed wireless. Who knows where inflation is, but is the Board now expecting you to deliver higher than this 3% growth? Again, you've got postpaid working. Now you're talking about prepaid, growing, you're making new investments. Shouldn't the expectation be that total wireless number, not 2025 guide, Tony, but like at some point, getting to a -- what is considered -- I mean, T-Mobile is considered a growth company, what are they doing, like 4%, 5% growth, like so delivering that type of growth? That's my first question.\nHans Vestberg: It was a good question, Walter. There was a lot of things to unpack there. But ultimately, you're right on many things we're doing. You're right. We're trying to turn everything right, but we also had some headwinds that with program amortization, for example, that is a headwind for us. So but all in all, our focus is to really do right and do more value for our customers. And I think we are have proven now the last six, seven quarters that we talked about that we can do it. Not going to go into confirming any of your growth numbers or percentages, but we are incentivized to grow our wireless service revenue, that's part of all the teams sitting there and all the V Teamers, they are incentivized to do that.. So of course, our focus is going to be that because we have a leverage model. If we grow, it basically falls down even more to the bottom line, and then we can both improve our cash flow and/or adjusted EBITDA. So all the things you are saying is what we are doing on. I'm not going to commit to any numbers. But clearly, that is to grow faster over time or be sustainable. That's very important for us because that is how we return both cash flow to our shareholders and continue to be an attractive stock to invest in.\nWalt Piecyk: Okay. And then just one quick one because you know I like care about the Apple stuff. I think Tony was very clear on where the current upgrade rates are. But the new narrative is, oh, even though AI sucks now, it's going to be better over the next couple of years. Just kind of your viewpoint on -- because you have to manage cash, right, based on upgrades over the next two years, do you think AI is something that is going to stimulate the upgrade rates within the wireless whether it's Verizon or just broadly in the industry? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: It's a little bit too early to say. I mean many of the AI application, of course, are very helpful. But when it comes to consumer devices, we also need to think about the processing power for this application, if you want to do something really innovative. So I think it's a bit too early to call that. I usually say, historically, when we've seen sort of cycles in our industry that's been 4G to 5G or hardware redesign. Those are the things that have triggered it. Now we're talking about is a software cycle's going to do it. It's too early for us to say at least, we're so far, and I'm looking at my colleagues, we haven't seen that. We haven't seen that is creating the cycle. But it's too early to say we're going to be -- if it's going to happen, we're going to be continued very discipline in how we do promotions. We're going to have the right promotions for the right customers at the right moment in the right segment with the right type of value. So we will continue the work we started somewhere in 2023 with segmenting approach on everything we're doing. Remember, I look at this as a customer sort of investment that we have, all the way from promotions, retention and media. For me that's one bucket, how I drive the market. And that's a tight budget for us, but it's very flexible. As I see Leslie is here in marketing. Sampath is here, Kyle is here. We sit down all the time and see should we put more retention, should we do more on promotion, should we do more on media. That is an ongoing work for us that is dynamic nowadays. Historically has been a little bit more static. But where the market is right now, this is super important to be good at this. And then AI comes in, so you can be even better to see that -- we have -- our customer segment here needs more offerings here. We need to come from here, need more media. We need more retention. All that is a new word where we are in a world where wireless and broadband is such a necessity. Everybody needs to have it. If you're a business or if you're an individual consumer, and we have the best products in both of them. We just need to see that we are creating the value for our customers, and we can go with them upwards. This is something we spent enormous lot of time on because we are getting into a new phase all our industry where I think that I don't think we have ever been as good position as well right now.\nA \u2013 Brady Connor: All right. We're going to go -- well, there's still hands up. Okay. We're going to cut in over here and then cook in, then we're going to come back to Laurent. And we'll finish with Jonathan and John.\nUnidentified Analyst: So maybe, I guess, to start with on fixed wireless. I mean I don't know if this understanding is correct, but it feels like the approach or the go-to-market strategy is mutually exclusive between fiber and fixed wireless in the sense that I don't think that's the approach some of your peers are taking where fixed wireless is top of the funnel, you upgrade people to fiber and it becomes a different path. For you it seems like a TAM opportunity where you expand the market. So first, I want to get an understanding of whether that's the go-to-market approach?\nA \u2013 Hans Vestberg: Yeah. We can confirm that one. Yeah, that is it. I mean we want to create optionality and that's how we build the networks. Different customers want fiber or Fios and others want fixed wireless access. We want to want to create that opportunity. I don't miss out on any of the segments because they like one product and the other. We are trying to address both of them. That's what the plan you see here.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then from a capital allocation perspective, I mean, when you think about your peers, they're obviously using a slightly different approach when it comes to investing in fiber with JVs and maybe more localized kind of an approach in different parts of the country using these JVs. And you followed a more of an on-balance sheet approach. Is that an option you have in the future to look at some of these structures? Or is this something that that you've made a deliberate choice on this is--?\nHans Vestberg: No, it's not a deliberate choice. It is -- we look into everything and it's an option, but again, it has to be a good return on investment. So far, we haven't found any third-party models where we don't own the capital and somebody else own the capital that is really attractive with our return on capital because we have one of the best into return on capital in the industry and we want to see that, that continues. So far, it has been organic. We're doing it. But -- nothing is excluded here. I mean, I usually say that the CEO, you can never say that are never going to do it and then suddenly you do it, then everybody say you told us not. But -- so I couldn't exclude it, but so far, we haven't found any of those models that we think is attractive in our capital allocation and our return to our shareholders.\nBrady Connor: We'll go to [indiscernible] next.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. [indiscernible] with Evercore ISI. Maybe for Sampath, I had a question about your perks portfolio. And the 7 million subscriptions, you mentioned is pretty impressive, fairly ambitious targets to double that going forward. Are you happy with the portfolio now? Do you see that changing? And as you expand that, does your relationship wholesale partnerships, does that dynamic change in your economics evolve, especially with entertainment partners that you have?\nSowmyanarayan Sampath: I think when we started launching myPlan, our sales teams were getting used to this. It was selling motion. Our customers are also getting used to it. So, if you look at our attach rate, it has grown significantly from when we launched at the beginning of the year, again, beginning of the year to where we are now, teams are getting more comfortable than that. So, that's why we get to 7 million. We'll double that at $10 a pop, you can do the math on where it goes. What we tend to find is the perks that do well for us are ones that are exclusive to us, ones that have maximum savings and then one just have a very strong value prop for the customer. So, you'll not see us have a very long tail on that. Because what it does is it doesn't focus the attention of the sales teams and our digital efforts to do that. So, we'll continue with our approach of having fewer, deeper relationships like right now, we have deep relations with Apple, with Disney, with Netflix, with MAX, some of our own perks as well. And also, it has to be margin accretive to us as well. We've been quite open about this. This is a margin play as much as it's a revenue play for us. So, fewer, more concentrated perks makes a lot more sense. And that if it kind of answers your second part of the question, we tend to have more leverage over our partners and that drives better economics for us in the process. But we're really excited about getting to double this perk portfolio with a pretty margin-rich pool that we have right now.\nHans Vestberg: And then adding also Sampath some of the combinations, we are unique. We're the only one who can do those combinations that we have had, for example, MAX and Netflix in the market. Nobody can combine that. That's how we have negotiated, so we have this flexibility and exclusivity to do it, and that is what is driving quite a lot of things. And all-in-all, every perk we have is a saving for you, for our customer. And of course, it's also a saving for our partners because ultimately, they're wholesaling to us, they don't have the cost of acquisition. But again, we only do it when we -- it's accretive for us as well. Has to be accretive for the customer, has to be accretive to us. And then we go forward and creating a very unique model. And sometimes, you might think this is pretty simple. But I'm looking at Shankar, with this our head of IT. Just imagine you can come into the store and actually be a Netflix customer and move over to be a Netflix customer to Verizon. We take care of all of that back end. The only thing you need to remember is your password. And sometimes that might be a problem, I know. But so just imagine how much work we have done to make this a unique offering that is hard to replicate, first of all, some of them are exclusive. And number two, you need to replicate a lot of things behind because if you're going to go home and then you log off and then you log on and cancel and everything. I can tell you the heat rate is low. Extremely low. And that's why we have worked so much with the customer experience here to do this in the right way. And I think that Sampath and Leslie and Shankar and the whole team have thought about how we make it simple for our customers. So I think this is just the beginning of us using the distribution as a strategy. We have the network. We have the distribution. We're just going to continue to do the right thing for our customers here, and that's going to pay off long term for us.\nBrady Connor: All right. So the clock is ticking down. We have time for one more. We're going to go Laurent here in the back.\nLaurent Yoon: Sorry, Sampath one more question for you. This is Laurent Yoon from Bernstein. You mentioned the 500 basis point incremental penetration of wireless and where you have fiber. Can you give us some color on correlation versus causation for that number? And secondly, how important is that observation or more explicitly. Is any of that the expectation of incremental wireless built into your fiber business case going to 35 million to 40 million passes?\nSowmyanarayan Sampath: Yes. Let me answer the second part first. Look, we feel comfortable between Joe, Tony and I on this 35% to 40%. Fiber economics is getting better over time. Two reasons. The first one is cost, as Joe said, we're getting better on technology, better systems, able to take cost out of the process. Second is penetration. A, north of 40% penetration, but also how quickly we get to that north of 40%. That's another important factor. Another important factor, Laurent, is the first year of penetration. How quickly we get to first year penetration. And as I said, we keep getting better every year on how quickly we get to year one penetration in that. So those are some of the factors that make fiber really attractive. On top that, now you have mobile plus home benefits that historically, we've not had or not spent enough time on. So that's kind of cherry on top of the whole Sunday in terms of why fiber economics looks really strong going forward to do that. To answer your first part of the question, if we see 500 basis points or 5% better wireless market share in Tier 1 large Tier 1 markets where we have fiber. Look, I think there is, a lot of it is driven by causation, because you have better brand, we're able to spend more money on marketing in those local markets. Two is also distribution. Historically, we've not had our stores get involved in Fios sale. Now we have a sales motion where all stores, especially in the Northeast, get more involved in the Fios sale. You saw that this quarter, we actually launched it this quarter when we do that. So better marketing, we're able to double down efforts but also you tend to get the cross-sell opportunity in that. So I think a lot of it is causation going forward. So there will be upside in our mobility case as we continue to get to 35 million to 40 million homes of fiber definitely.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I guess we are wrapping up. First of all, thank you, everyone on the webcast, everyone coming here face-to-face in New York. Hopefully, you've got more insights, both to our third quarter, but also to our expanded broadband strategy, and for sure, we will back with more information as we have more quarters to come and other activities. So once again, thank you so much, guys, for coming. Thank you."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 2, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-07-22 12:06:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussions of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Investor Relations website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning we posted to our Invest Relations website a detailed review of our second quarter results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Brady. Good morning and welcome to Verizon's second quarter 2024 earnings call. This quarter marks the beginning of Verizon's next chapter. We have launched a comprehensive brand refresh that goes far beyond the new logo. This transformation embodies our commitment to bringing choice, value, and control to our customers' lives, reflecting our evolution and vision for the future of connectivity. We refreshed our brand as our strategy continues to deliver strong results. The three pillars of our performance, wireless service revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, expansion and increased free cash flow remain solid, showing both sequential and year-over-year improvements. In the second quarter, we saw wireless service revenue climb 3.5% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA rise by 2.8%, and free cash flow increased 3% compared to last year. Our improving operations and results build on our first quarter momentum, keep us on track to meet our 2024 financial guidance and are paving the way for a sustained growth. Our progress comes from innovation that deeply resonates with customers, including the most personalized offerings in the industry. These initiatives align perfectly with our core strategy to strengthen and grow customer relationships while delivering the best return on invested capital. We launched myPlan in 2023 and it delighted our customers. In just over a year, over 30% of our subscribers are using it. That is an incredible adoption rate and now we're bringing these features to Home Internet with myHome. We're building and expanding on our strengths and successes and you can expect that to continue. For businesses we launched Verizon Business Complete, the industry's only end-to-end smartphone management system. We cover everything from selecting the first phone to upgrades with 24-hour service and same-day equipment replacement. These initiatives, combined with our strong network performance and extensive distribution, are reinforcing our leadership position and driving our industry forward. Turning to the second quarter. We had a strong operational performance across mobility, broadband and our network. Our overall execution in consumer mobility has been improving quarter-after-quarter since early last year and our momentum continues. Consumer postpaid phone gross adds are up 12% year-over-year, which is amazing. Total postpaid phone net adds of 148,000 is a big improvement year-over-year and sequentially, and we expect to have positive postpaid phone net adds in consumer for the year. Choice is at the core of our approach, and we're constantly working on new partnerships that give our customers more options and value. One example is our addition of YouTube Premium and Peacock subscriptions which makes us the only provider offering our customers savings on 10 of the top streaming services. These content partnerships give our customers compelling reasons to shop with us. We also had a very strong quarter for postpaid phone net adds in Verizon Business at 156,000. This is a sharp improvement from the first quarter and shows how important we are to small, mid-sized and large businesses. Our business customers continue to invest in mobility and we offer them the widest range of choices. In the consumer value market, we are applying the same customer-centric discipline and rigor as we do in the post-paid market and are seeing significant net add improvements excluding SafeLink. We recently relaunched Total by Verizon as Total Wireless and enhanced our offerings with price guarantees, upgrade credits and other features. In broadband, we're still taking share with 391,000 net adds in the second quarter. Fixed wireless access remains a key driver with higher net adds than in the first quarter. We continue to grow our broadband base ending the quarter with more than 11.5 million broadband subscribers. We're also continuing to add business from large customers like government agencies. We're very proud that we were awarded a new contract from the U.S. Department of the Navy to provide wireless devices and device management building on our previous work together. For first responders, Verizon frontline delivers mission-critical connectivity and advanced solution to more than 40,000 public safety agencies across the United States, serving them with everything from device and network management to digital transformation. Verizon is there when people need us most from protecting the front-lines to natural disaster response. In fact, recent FCC data show us that overall our network outperformed our peers in areas affected by the Hurricane Beryl. I could not be proud of that. It's one of the reasons we're so committed to the network superiority and we're continuing to expand C-Band in suburban and rural areas. Our initial C-Band markets outperform with better gross add growth, higher uptake of premium services, and lower churn. We now have nearly half of our network traffic running on ultra-wideband, up from 36% a year ago. That number will continue to grow as we expand C-band reach. We're also working to enhance our network coverage by partnering with AST SpaceMobile to provide satellite to device connectivity using the 850 megahertz spectrum. This will bring our network to unserved communities, as we target 100% coverage from coast to coast. Our portfolio of high performance spectrum, the capacity of our fiber and our ability to deploy and support mobile edge compute, make us as the backbone of the AI economy and the partner of choice for players in the space. We will power the best AI services for our customers. What set us apart with AI is our network's mobile edge computing capabilities and deep fiber footprint. By processing data closer to the source, we enable real-time AI application that requires security, ultra-low latency, and high bandwidth. This is where our network shines, opening up possibilities that simply weren't feasible before. We're already seeing the benefits of AI in our operations. For example, we use AI to route customer support calls to agents best-suited to help. We analyze more than 800 data points per call to save our customers time and spare them frustration. It takes the best network to power these applications and today RootMetrics awarded us an outright win for national overall wireless network performance. Verizon also won the most national, state, and metro awards, including outright wins for accessibility, data performance, and streaming video performance. This is a kind of superior network performance that our customers deserve and expect from us. I'm pleased with our first half-year performance on how well our team is executing our strategy. I always say there's more work to do and there always is. We are seeing improving postpaid phone net adds in consumer, performing extremely well in business and taking share in broadband. We are achieving growth in a disciplined, balanced way and have built great momentum heading into the second half of the year and into 2025. Now I would hand over the call to Tony for a deeper dive into our performance.\nTony Skiadas : Thanks Hans and good morning. Our second quarter results reflected accelerated growth in wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as we continue to generate strong free cash flow. These results were driven by strong operational execution in both consumer and business, which led to sequential net add improvements in postpaid phones, fixed wireless access, and prepaid excluding SafeLink. Within consumer, postpaid phone gross adds were approximately 1.8 million in the second quarter, a 12% year-over-year increase. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth. Excluding our second number offering, consumer post-paid phone gross adds grew 5% year-over-year. Consumer post-paid phone churn was 0.79% in the second quarter, up slightly from the prior year period. This was in-line with our expectations as we recently implemented several price increases that are expected to generate well over $1 billion in annualized wireless service revenue. We believe the majority of the pricing churn is now behind us and we continue to expect full-year consumer postpaid phone churn to be flat or slightly better than last year. Consumer postpaid phone net losses were 8,000 for the second quarter, which marks a significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. For the full year, we expect to deliver positive consumer postpaid phone net adds without the contribution from our second number offering. Moving to prepaid, we continue to make progress with our core brands while navigating the conclusion of the ACP program. Overall prepaid net losses were 624,000, including 410,000 losses related to the ACP shutdown, the vast majority of which are in our SafeLink brand. Excluding SafeLink, prepaid net losses were 12,000, a substantial improvement compared to the prior year period. Visible and total wireless continue to expand and perform well, while our operational execution with Straight Talk continues to improve. We exited the quarter with good momentum and prepaid, setting the stage for a stronger performance in the second half of 2024 and positioning us well for 2025. On the business side, postpaid phone net adds were 156,000 in the second quarter, the best performance in the last six quarters. We saw a strong sequential improvement of phone net adds across small and medium businesses, as well as enterprise and public sector customers. Turning to broadband, our total broadband net additions were 391,000 for the quarter, representing the eighth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 broadband net adds. In fixed wireless access, we continue to focus on building a long-term sustainable business. Total fixed wireless net adds were 378,000 in the quarter, up sequentially. This brings our base above 3.8 million subscribers, up nearly 69% year-over-year. Consumer fixed wireless net adds were 218,000, a 15,000 sequential increase as we continue to see healthy demand for reliable broadband even in a seasonally softer quarter. Verizon business continued strong execution with 160,000 fixed wireless access net adds, a quarterly record. Demand for the service is strengthening as small businesses and enterprises continue to trust the reliability of the product and speed and ease of deployment. Overall, Fios Internet net adds totaled 28,000 for the quarter. We are pleased with the continuous growth of Fios, even with the effects of the ACP shutdown and lower move activity. We ended the quarter with over 11.5 million broadband subscribers, a 17% increase from a year ago. Our broadband growth continues to significantly outpace that of the broader market, given our superior network experience and strong execution. Moving to the financials, we delivered another solid quarter and remain on track to meet our full year financial guidance. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter totaled $32.8 billion, a 0.6% increase year-over-year. That growth was driven by service and other revenue which grew 1.8% year-over-year, partially offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue, as total upgrades were down nearly 13% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue totaled $19.8 billion, a sequential increase of more than $250 million, and year-over-year growth of 3.5% or $660 million. The increase was primarily driven by consumer wireless service revenue, which grew 3.7% year-over-year to $16.3 billion. Consumer postpaid ARPA grew 5% year-over-year, reflecting the benefits of pricing actions and fixed wireless growth. In addition, myPlan helps to drive ARPA growth through premium mix adoption and [Perk] (ph) revenue. As Hans said, we now have over 30% of our consumer phone lines on myPlan and expect this to expand meaningfully going forward. FWA revenue which is included in wireless service revenue was $514 million for the quarter, up more than $200 million versus the prior year period. Launched at scale in 2021, our FWA business is expected to generate more than $2 billion in revenue this year with prospects for continued healthy growth. Prepaid revenue for the quarter declined $162 million versus the prior year period. The headwind to wireless service revenue growth from the ACP shutdown was approximately 30 basis points within the range we provided last quarter, and the margin impact was insignificant. With the majority of ACP disconnects now behind us and the momentum growing in our core prepaid brand, we are better positioned for the remainder of the year and heading into 2025. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $12.3 billion an increase of 2.8% year-over-year. The improved operating leverage reflects the lower upgrade activity and our disciplined approach to growth. We are making progress in our ongoing cost efficiency program and recently introduced new measures to improve our operating efficiency, including a voluntary separation program announced in June. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.15, down 5% compared to the prior year period. Growth in adjusted EBITDA was offset by below-the-line items, including higher interest expense, predominantly due to lower capitalized interest as we put more C-band spectrum into service. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $16.6 billion for the first half of the year compared to $18 billion in the prior year period. The results reflect higher cash taxes of approximately $1.7 billion, predominantly due to the unwind of bonus depreciation, as well as higher interest expense primarily driven by the decrease in capitalized interest. Capital spending for the first half of the year totaled $8.1 billion. This was $2 billion less than the same period last year as we have returned to historical levels of capital intensity. The network build remains ahead of schedule with C-band deployed on nearly 60% of our planned sites. Our full year guidance for CapEx spending remains unchanged at a range of $17 billion to $17.5 billion. The net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of $8.5 billion for the first half of 2024. This represents an increase of nearly 7% or approximately $550 million from the prior year period, despite higher cash taxes and interest expense. We expect to generate strong cash flow in the back half of the year that will support paying down debt. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $122.8 billion, an improvement of $3.2 billion compared to the previous quarter and $3.7 billion lower year-over-year. Our net unsecured debt to a consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times, an improvement from 2.6 times last quarter. The strength of our results and momentum in our business put us in a great position to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In particular, we remain on track to further reduce the leverage on our balance sheet in the second half of the year. In summary with 2024, reaching its midpoint, the team's strong execution and operating momentum is translating into results. We have good momentum in mobility as reflected by the strong gross add growth and continue to take share in broadband through fixed wireless access and Fios. Importantly, we are accomplishing this with a disciplined approach, balancing growth and profitability providing the confidence to deliver on our 2024 financial guidance. With that, I will turn it back to Hans for his final remarks before opening the call to your questions.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Tony. Our focus for the second half of the year remains clear to drive growth in wireless service revenue, expand adjusted EBITDA and generate strong free cash flow. We are evolving our broadband strategy as we approach 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless access subscribers, and we'll continue to scale the business along with the private networks while driving mobility growth. Our ongoing C-band expansion will be crucial in supporting these efforts, enhancing our network performance and opening new opportunities across markets. Our commitment to a differentiated customer experience and operational excellence remains firm. The success of myPlan and our brand refresh are proof of our ability to meet evolving customer needs. We will build on these successes in the quarters ahead, as we work to deliver value to all of our stakeholders. We will continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities by investing in the business, supporting our dividend and paying down debt. As AI continues to reshape our industry, Verizon is well-positioned to enable and benefit from it. Our reliable, secure and powerful network will be at the forefront of AI and mobile edge compute applications. This is an exciting time for us at Verizon. Mobility, broadband and cloud, our essential services and their value has never been higher. We power and empower how people live, work and play. We are in a great business and there's so much more to come. We have the right assets and the strategy in place for success this year and beyond. I'm more excited than ever about what lies ahead of us. Now Brady, we are ready to take questions.\nBrady Connor : Thanks Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thank you and good morning, guys. Two questions, if I can. First, on ACP, was there any impact on the broadband side in the quarter? And do you expect any lingering impact from ACP, either in prepaid or postpaid or broadband, as we look out into the second half? And then second on upgrades, obviously another strong quarter with record, I think, record low upgrades. Given the AI phones coming out in the second, third quarter, how do you expect that to trend? And what do you expect the impact to be on the financials of the wireless business as we look out into the second half?\nHans Vestberg: Thanks, John. On the ACP, Tony will give you the details. But yes, we had some impact on the prepaid brand as was expected, and also a little bit on Fios. Looking forward I see this is a great opportunity. I mean 21 million people having ACP and the importance of mobility and broadband today is so important. And our offerings, but all the way from broadband with Verizon forward, fixed wireless access, both very efficient and then on the prepaid brands. So I see that as an opportunity going forward, but some slight impact on volumes this quarter. On the upgrades, as you have seen the upgrades has been a little bit low for a while. It is two things. First of all, the quality of the phones has continued to go up. But secondly, I think even more important is the discipline that we have shown over the years right now, I think for the last 1.5 years, how we do the promotions, how we look at the customer investment bucket and see that we are actually distributing our money. We are going to see what's going to happen in this cycle. I don't feel very worried about it. I feel that we are in a great position to handle it, and it's all in our guide what we are expecting. So I don't see any major things happening here. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah, thanks. Good morning John. In terms of ACP updates, let me give you a couple of things here. So as we said previously, the majority of the ACP exposure is in our prepaid business. And as we said last time, we had about 1.1 million prepaid subs that benefited from the ACP program. In the quarter -- in the second quarter, we saw about 400,000 prepaid disconnects. This is the vast majority of what we expected. There is minimal impact on the postpaid side as I think was part of your question. We saw some pressure in Fios in terms of gross add opportunity. If we look ahead in the third quarter, we expect some disconnects in prepaid and a small number across other products. In terms of revenue, we also said that any impact that we would see we'd see on service revenue up to 50 basis points of headwind and we're tracking inside of that number right now. And even with the disconnects, the margin exposure from ACP was insignificant in the second quarter. So we will continue to keep everyone updated as we progress here.\nJohn Hodulik: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, great. Thanks John. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. On fixed wireless, you talked about the strong momentum. You obviously have a lot of C-band still to build out would expand your addressable market. I guess you're going to hit the $4 million, the low end of your guide probably in the August timeframe. So help us think about what's the potential beyond the $4 million to $5 million. And when you can give us more clarity on your opportunity there? I think you've talked before about plenty of excess capacity. And then there were media reports the other day about you looking potentially to monetize towers. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about tower sales or other real estate, other asset monetization? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you Simon. On fixed wireless access, you are rightfully say it. We have good momentum came into this quarter with 378,000 new net adds on fixed wireless access doing strong, both on consumer, as well as on a business. And we are now expanding our C-band to suburban and rural, which is another type of opportunity, less penetrated, but also more vastly distributed. So we are gearing for getting to our target between 4 million and 5 million fixed wireless access broadband customers. And as soon as we get there as I've said before, I will come back and see how we see the opportunity going forward. But clearly, we have a great network that can ingest more customers over time. But let me come back on the exact details of that when we reach the target. On the towers, I mean, or any rumor I wouldn't comment on any rumor. What you should know is that Tony and I are very committed to improve our cash flow, whatever we can see to see that we optimize our assets, we will do that but I have no comments or rumors in the market. But the focus on cash flow is extremely important because it goes straight into our capital priorities. That's why we've been so focused on for the last couple of years, and we did yet again in this quarter, good progress on them.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks, Hans.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, great. Thanks, Simon. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir.\nJim Schneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I may. First, on broadband. Could you comment on sort of the overall health of the broadband market that you are seeing? And then maybe any more quantitative guidance you can give us on the amount of headroom you see in your overall network capacity relative to fixed wireless subscribers? And then secondly, on the wireless side. In terms of the service revenue growth, what's your level of confidence that you can drive more volume growth and still maintain the same level of pricing power over the next 12 months or so? And how do you expect that volume price split to work out for you over the next year or so?\nHans Vestberg: So on the broadband, I think again, we are between 375,000 to 400,000 net adds in broadband this quarter, been it for quite a while. So we see it as a very healthy. I think also we have a really good offering. And now with myHome that we just announced, I think we are going to be even stronger on it. So we see it healthy. Of course, Fios is by far the best fiber product in the market. And then fixed wireless access, the differentiation of the product, how we deploy it, how the customer provision it so different. And with all the streaming agreements we have right now, we can scale that horizontally to all our customers. So I see it is a very healthy business for us today. When it comes to our capacity on fixed wireless access -- yet again, I mean as we said, less than -- around 50% of all the traffic is now on C-band. So we have a way to go and we have deployed only a portion. So as we deploy more, we of course open up more opportunities. Finally, and maybe Tony has some addition. On the volume growth, I'm excited of what we have done in the consumer side with myPlan, and all the new innovations were done with our customers, and we see it resonate with the market. And clearly, quarter-by-quarter, we have improved both our revenue but also operation volumes on postpaid. Prepaid you saw it yourself, a big step forward on prepaid this quarter. And then our business side, I mean Kyle and the team has been now for I\u2019m not sure how many quarters been around 125, up to 150 net adds on wireless. So all-in-all, I see that with the offerings that we put into the market, the refresh of the brand that is supporting that we are in a good position going into the second half of this year. Tony, any additions to that?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah. Thanks, Hans. So very comfortable with the revenue guide for the year. As Hans said, the performance and execution is very much on track, and we continue to find a better balance of P&Q. And you see the progress on volumes, as Hans said, B2 mobility and SWA. And maybe just a few additional points to consider. First we expect to see sequential growth in service revenue in the second half of the year. Also, I would say the year-over-year comps are a little more challenging in the second half as we lap the pricing changes from 2023. The wildcard obviously, is the promotional environment and the level of upgrades we'll have to see where that goes. But having said all that, the assumptions that we have in the service revenue guide have not changed. So overall, we feel good about our revenue performance and the momentum in the business, and we're not going to guide on '25 at this time, but I would tell you that those assumptions will carry forward as well.\nJim Schneider: Thanks.\nBrady Connor: Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of JPMorgan. Your line is open sir.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the 2024 consumer postpaid phone expectations to report positive net adds for the year, excluding the second-line. If you could perhaps maybe help us think about the pace or expectations for the second-line contribution in the back half of the year? Obviously, a pretty healthy run rate here in the second quarter on a full quarterly basis relative to the first quarter. So just how should we think about that in terms of trying to unpack the underlying benefit relative to the second-line benefit? And then, Tony another quick question, just helpful color there on service revenue expectations, quarterly growth over the balance of the year. But can you perhaps help us think about margins? Obviously, decent -- nice growth here in the second quarter in business. How should we think about the contribution or perhaps from the HCL Tech Managed Services savings coming through? And I think you also mentioned there was a voluntary separation program in the market. I think we had seen headlines to that intra-quarter. How should we think about maybe the contributions from those two items impacting margin and maybe EBITDA growth expectations or how you're thinking about the phasing of those in the back half. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Thank you. I'll start and Tony will give you the details. As we said before, I mean the second-line offering is straight into our strategy. The strategy is to build the network ones and have as many profitable connections on top of it in order to get the best return on invested capital. And you can see that is really happening, and that's been a very big focus for us. Tony will give you some more details on how it looks in the second half here. On the programs of cost, we put in last year a couple of really large programs all the way from agreement with HL together with large customer care changes. Many of those are now coming into the base, and that's why you see the leverage. But we also have quite a lot of new things coming up. And as you rightfully mentioned, we have a voluntary separation program that is ongoing right now. We also have all the efficiencies with AI that is coming through. And of course we continue with our disciplined approach on investments. So all-in-all, there is more things to come. And -- but we have gotten leverage from some of the things we did last year, Tony.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks. Hi, Sebastiano. On the second number, just a few points, Hans touched on this upfront, but this is a great business. We are providing customers options and flexibility. It is a very profitable connection and we would do it every day of the week. In terms of the market for this, we'll see how the TAM evolves. We shared the gross add impact you can assume some level of churn in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect less of a contribution from second number in the back half of the year. It is high-margin business comparable to ARPU [add-a-line] (ph) offerings. The ARPU is very good and very comparable to add-a-line, without the device subsidy. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in consumer for the year without the contribution from second number. And the results in the quarter reflect the strength of our core business. And then on your question on EBITDA and cost transformation, we're very comfortable with the EBITDA guide. We made a lot of progress. You saw the 80 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. And the program in terms of delivering cost transformation is on track. Hans talked about some of the work we are doing, and we did last year with customer care and with managed services. We have a lot of work going on right now between IT and real estate, and network decommissioning. In addition, Hans mentioned the voluntary separation program. And some of that savings will start manifesting in the back end of this year and into 2025. And then lastly AI is an enabler of efficiencies. You can think about customer care, you can think about the personalization with myPlan. And we see efficiencies coming from there as well. But we're very much on track. We are operating differently. And we feel good about the progress on cost actions that are driving the improvements in EBITDA that you see in the first half of the year.\nSebastiano Petti: Great. Thank you for the question.\nBrady Connor : Yeah, thanks Sebastiano. Brad we are ready for the next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I'm curious on the pricing front, where does in wireless postpaid the back book sit on average relative to your front book offers? And do you think the pricing environment in the postpaid wireless category can start to look more like fixed broadband or the video product categories where those products have tended to see some kind of pricing actions on a somewhat annual basis?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you Mike. I think in general, when we see the value accretion we have done recently, very much about new offerings to see that our customers are getting more value from the offerings we have. We have done some price adjustments historically. I think that Sampath in the consumer side has said that he would get better balance between volume and value increases. So that's what you see right now. And then on the business side, we have constantly done a great job. I mean Kyle and his team has constantly continue with a really high market share, continue to gain in every area like government, large enterprise and SMBs. So in the quarter you saw that the offerings we're doing with myHome and the additions on myPlan. And of course, with also the new offerings in business, Business Complete which is a new way to serve our SMBs. All of them are accretive and value but also giving our customers better services. So that's how we continue to work. And we are in sort of the third-phase of wireless where wireless is so important for our customers, and we see it also as an opportunity with the largest direct-to-consumer business in the country to actually add support with them with new services and layering on. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Just a couple of other things to add. I mean as we said upfront, we said we need to find a better balance of P&Q in 2024, and we are doing that. We are very confident, Mike in our back book. We've been very consistent, as Hans said, about evaluating pricing opportunities, aligning the price with the value proposition for customers. We did take pricing actions in the first half of the year that provide a good tailwind to service revenue, and those pricing actions were contemplated in the guide, but it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on what we might do in the future.\nMichael Rollins: Yeah, thanks.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Mike. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question sir.\nDavid Barden: Hi guys. Thanks so much. So Tony, yes, you guys had real demonstrable success on the P side of the equation and it helps to be the industry upward. Can we talk a little bit more about the Q -- the account number that you reported this quarter, I think it's the lowest that we've seen since the data I have going back from 2016. And so the way that the queue is growing is by kind of a shrinking number of accounts, but putting more and more into those accounts. I'm guessing the second-line strategy is one of those strategies. But can you talk a little bit about what kind of duration, durability this approach to growth has and -- or do we need to see accounts grow in order to believe that Verizon is really on the right growth path? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: Hi, David. Good morning. So look as we said before, finding the right balance of P&Q. And I think you've heard Sampath and I talk about something like 80-20 price-volume mix last year was more like 100, so clearly making progress on that. And keep in mind, we have a very high-quality customer base, and we see it in the results quarter-after-quarter. And I think you see the momentum in both gross adds and in net adds in the quarter, and it is very high-quality growth, both on the consumer and the business side. Business had a very strong quarter as well on volumes. And you also see the growth in fixed wireless access. We did 378,000 fixed wireless access net adds that continue to provide a tailwind to service revenue. So we are trying to find that right balance of P&Q, and I think the results reflect that.\nDavid Barden: Great.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Dave. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open sir.\nPeter Supino: Good morning. Thanks. A question about capital allocation. As we approach 2025 and your leverage target, I'm wondering how you would encourage us to think or how you do think about the possibility of building more fiber as opportunity costing that against share repurchases. I wonder how you think about the returns on each of those projects. And separately, to the extent that capital is scarce, is there an argument for maintaining leverage at a constant level and even more of above? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: Hi, Peter. When it comes to our capital allocation priorities, they haven't changed. I mean first of all, we put the money in the business. And this year, we have the guide between [$17 billion and $17.5 billion] (ph). So -- but of course, if we see opportunities to gain more revenue and grow business, we will always look into the business side. Secondly, the dividend is very important. I mean we have now been growing our dividend for 17 consecutive quarters. And Tony and my job of -- years, not quarters. And Tony and I are committed to continue to put the Board in a position to do that. And you see on our pay ratio, we're well inside that ratio doing well. And then we're paying down our debt. We paid down debt this quarter. Second half, we're going to continue with that. We will not consider any conversation about buybacks until we get to 225. And after that there is a lot of factors in the market, the priorities but also where is the interest rates, where is share price and all of that. So let us focus on the priority in the order we have said, and that's how we are going to continue for the next foreseeable future.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Peter. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question sir.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks. I want to return to the upgrade cycle. Apple is obviously betting that they can drive a significant upgrade cycle with AI. I wonder if you could just talk about the percentage of phones in your base that are, I believe Apple's requirement will be 8 gigabytes of RAM and -- meaning it's going to be the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max. What percentage of your phones are already of that level? And how many would presumably require upgrades? And then how you just -- how do you think about how quickly that upgrade cycle comes and what that might mean in terms of the cost and margins for your wireless business?\nHans Vestberg: Thank you, Craig. I don't have the exact number, but I know that we have a fair amount of new phones, of course in the base because with our high quality customer base on postpaid, many of our customers are already on later versions of the iPhones. Again looking into this cycle, I mean, -- of course, we are going to see some excitement around AI. I don't think that it is going to be any particular at this time. It will be over time, maybe. We have a very disciplined model when it comes to a approach expectations for promotion, et cetera. We will stick to that. we believe that we have such a great network, great offerings. So we can actually manage that, and we will continue to do so. And then talking about the AI. I mean I think where I'm most excited is, of course that we have built sort of the Verizon Intelligent edge network which will be the platform for the GenAI economy because you are going to have to have a lot more compute storage at the edge of the network, and that's how we built the network already 2018 with fiber to all our main hubs and between our main subcenters. And then on top of that, we have cooling and power at those edges. And I think as we go from the LLMs and we go into sort of doing commercial products for enterprises. Our network is set up for that. And so I'm very excited for that opportunity going forward together with private networks. So \u2013 there is a lot of things coming into GenAI devices, our efficiencies but also a business opportunity for us when it comes to AI.\nBrady Connor : Great, thanks Craig. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Your line is open sir.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. To what extent do you think that fixed mobile conversion will be more of the norm in the US? And given your smaller wireline footprint, do you think you need to expand your fiber-to-the-home assets? Or how would you address that? And then want to clarify the target leverage you are looking for, is that 2.2 times total leverage or 2.2 times unsecured? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: On the mobile convergence fixed mobile convergence, we see some uptick on that. As I said before, we will follow the customers. We have all these economics on wireless and on broadband. And we will see that if our customer wants to have a converged product, we will do that. I don't believe in sort of discounting products to get there. But of course, our efficiency if one customer has both mobility and broadband from us, and we will see that we share that with our customers as an opportunity. So I don't think we are going to see the European levels here because of the nature of the market. But as we move further into convergence, we will be very well positioned with the products we have. Tony, on the leverage?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. So Frank, on the leverage metric, the long-term goal is 1.75 to 2 on the unsecured. And then we said we would consider buybacks when we got to 2.25, again unsecured.\nFrank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks Frank. We are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open sir.\nTimothy Horan: Hi, guys. Focusing back on the network. I know the C-band initial deployments were just for a portion of the spectrum and they weren't used in the full range of technologies. And I know you said 60%. Can you talk about -- where are you with kind of upgrading to the entire C-band level of spectrum and to Massive MIMO and also then to stand-alone? And kind of related to this, I know you saw some major network improvements with the initial upgrades or build out to C-band. Can you talk about what you're seeing when you go back with the second upgrade? And I have a follow-up on what you do with AI? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: On the C-band, you are right. We almost have now 50% of our traffic on the C-band, but we still have some deployment to be done in suburban and rural. Many of those sites are prepared for it, so we are just rolling out as we speak right now. So we are going to see that continue. Joe and his team in technology, very much focused on customer satisfaction when it comes to the rollout and revenue generation right now. That's the main focus we have at Verizon. And the same trend as we saw in the beginning where we have better upgrades, lower churn, whereas C-band and of course also getting fixed wireless access opportunity. The same goes for where we are enhancing or continuing to new areas. Secondly you asked about all the new features coming into 5G advance with SA, Massive MIMO, all of that is just expanding our capacity and bringing even more opportunities for us for revenue and seeing that we create the customer expectations on the best network in the nation. So -- and that's just -- we're just in the beginning of that. So I'm very pleased with what I see. The team is running as fast as we can and we get good feedback on C-band. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Thanks, Hans. So just a couple of other points. On C-band, we are seeing good improvements in churn 3 basis points. On gross adds, we see about 9 basis points gross add strength. And as we deploy suburban and rural gross adds are up threefold in those markets. And then premium mix continues to be stronger as well of about 10%. And we do have now at this point nearly 60% of our planned sites are now deployed with C-band. So really making really good progress.\nTimothy Horan: And I'm assuming you need stand-alone to enable some of these AI/MEC applications you're talking about, and I can be wrong about that, but any upgrade on the timing of when standalone gets deployed nationwide? And do you have any of these AI/MEC applications that are up and running now? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: We can do mobile edge compute without SA. We have done that for five years. Then there are some efficiencies on especially private networks and deployment with SA. But again, you need a full ecosystem all the way from the devices and the network features and the core in order to do that. So it is a little bit of a holistic thinking again when we work it, but we can already deliver that right now. When it comes to GenAI in mobile edge compute, that -- we don't have that to our customers right now. But the conversation with many of both the cloud players as well as enterprises of doing that when they have commercial products, and not only training large language modules. And that's how we designed our network. So that's why I'm excited of it. At the same time, we already have four GenAI products in the market that is deployed on 40,000 agents to all our stores, et cetera personalization, more efficiency for customer and employee experience. And we see a great opportunity for that. So there are multiple opportunities with AI for us and we have been on to it for a long time.\nTimothy Horan: Great.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Tim. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. Your line is open sir.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Tony, I think in the prepared remarks, you referenced voluntary separation program in June. I wonder if you can give us a sense of -- I mean I know you've done these in the past potential EBITDA benefit. And just remind us, does this result like in, I guess, onetime charges relative to the severance or the separation payments that are made and just kind of quantify that a bit, if you can?\nTony Skiadas: Sure. Hi Walt. So a couple of things. We announced the program in early June for a portion of our workforce. The process is not going to be fully completed until the back end of August. So I don't have numbers at this point. It was contemplated in their full year guide. And we do expect to see savings towards the back end of 2024 and into 2025, and we'll come back with disclosures on the program once it is finalized. We'll file an 8-K similar to how we did it last time.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay. And then Hans, it is not a reported number, but you can kind of calculate what wholesale revenue looks like and we know who the principal driver of that is. It seemed like that was kind of strong this quarter sequentially. I don't know, if there is some seasonality there. I'm looking last year and the year before, it doesn't seem like that. So is this a good thing or a bad thing, obviously, because it could imply stronger growth at a wholesale customer at the expense of your retail business. And just can you give us a sense in general of your outlook for that line. There has been some discussion and debate about how some terms can change or other offloading activities can occur for that customer. So just if you can comment on the quarter and just generally your outlook for wholesale in terms of a component of your sectors of growth, like how important is wholesale in terms of meeting the growth targets that you promised the Board?\nHans Vestberg: I don't have any comments on the quarter on the numbers. We try to have our Chinese [Walls] (ph) here, so I don't have it. But in general, we see these partnership has imported enterprise customers. And it goes back to the strategy we have, meaning we build the network once. And we have -- want to have as many profitable connections on top of the network in order to get the best return on invested capital. So that's where we are. And we have a good relationship with the [MVNO] (ph) customers, and we have many of them, and it will continue. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Yes. Look, I mean the \u2013 it is very profitable business, as Hans said and is a great contribution to revenue and EBITDA consistent with the strategy to monetize the network, and we are very comfortable with the arrangements we have, but that's as far as we can go.\nWalter Piecyk: Can I just pivot and just -- then just ask one related but kind of high level question. There has been some reports of T-Mobile doing some additional fiber asset joint partnerships. If the administration changes, maybe there's opportunities for some additional vertical integration. But I guess the big question is, at least for me, how important is it in the long-term for you to have a vertical solution for customers, meaning that the consumer can buy their home broadband and their wireless services from you or -- and if you're not doing that obviously, outside of the Fios markets, is that a risk if others put together that vertical solution?\nHans Vestberg: We are well positioned in that area. And again if the market go convergence between mobility and broadband, we will be there to serve our customers either with Fios and fixed wireless access. And right now, that's working really good for us. So we are happy with our assets we have and how we're deploying them right now. We're looking into how we can continue to meet our customer demands. And now we also launched, as you saw in the quarter on the consumer side, myHome where we have all the benefits we had from myPlan. We are moving over to myHome. I feel good about what our consumer division is doing on broadband and mobility at the moment with the product. We are Number One in the market, so we just need to continue to keep the lead and continue to keep innovating, and I feel good about the consumer team doing that.\nWalter Piecyk: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Thanks Walt. Brad, we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sam McHugh of BNP Paribas. Your line is open sir.\nSam McHugh: Good morning guys. Two quick questions. In the last few years, you've gone through quite a big reinvestment phase, I guess in the consumer division with the launch of myPlan, the refresh of the brand this quarter. As we look out kind of the next two or three years and take a big step back, should we think you are now at a place where EBITDA can sustainably grow ahead of service revenues? Yes, that's question one. And the second part just a clarification. Tony, you mentioned something about 2H wireless service revenue trends versus the first half. If you wouldn't mind just repeating it, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: When it comes to continue to have leverage on our EBITDA together with our service revenue, I think it is clear for us that the KPIs that we are measured on as a management team and me, myself is on the growth on the service revenue, wireless service revenue expansion as well as EBITDA and cash flow. And that's how we are working holistically. So yes, we -- our goal is to see that we have the leverage on our service revenue growth right now. We have great products. We work with efficiency. There are of course, pressures in our business as and the business, but that's what we strive for. But we don't guide for '25 or something like that at this moment, we will come back on that. But our work and our KPIs are set up for that. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Thanks. Hi, Sam. So on the service revenue for the second half, what we said is we expect to see sequential growth in service revenue in the second half. And when we talked about the assumptions that we had in the guide, we said, look we had pricing actions that we've already taken and you see that well over $1 billion. We also said we have an improving volume profile in consumer and you see that progress. Fixed wireless access continues to scale. And we have over $500 million now in fixed wireless access revenue on a run rate of over $2 billion and that base of business continues to grow. We also said we had headwinds in prepaid, and that's improving, and we will see that improving as time goes on and then from our amortization. And the promo discipline continues to be encouraging, and we say we see a similar level year-over-year. So those assumptions haven't changed and we feel really good about the performance on service revenue, and the momentum we have in the business heading into the second half.\nSam McHugh: Awesome thanks.\nBrady Connor: Great. Thanks Sam. Brad, we have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir.\nBryan Kraft: Thanks good morning. I have one for Tony and one for Hans. Tony, regarding free cash flow, it's up, I think, about 12% year-over-year in the first half. do you anticipate being able to grow free cash flow this year? Or is the year-to-date growth we've seen more a function of favorable timing in the first half with higher CapEx and working capital usage coming in the second half? And then Hans, you had talked quite a bit about Verizon's strong position for AI and enterprise. Is there anything you can share on what you're seeing in 5G enterprise adoption and also on the sales pipeline activity that you are seeing? Thank you.\nHans Vestberg: I'll start with the first one, and then I can hand it over to Tony on the cash flow. Yes, what we see is private networks continue to grow in volume and -- which is a prelude, you start with the private network then you start adding on applications on it. And of course ultimately, you put in mobile edge compute. We have all that set up since 2018, 2019, and we start seeing more and more business case for logistics centers, for factories, et cetera where we can do it. And then GenAI will only sort of capitalize that and do it even faster. That is going to take some time because right now, many corporation enterprises are in the learning process, meaning they are training their data sets. So it is going to take some time. But I don't think that anyone is even close to be as well-positioned as we are in GenAI and the [GenAI economy] (ph), both for taking advantage of it efficiency-wise, internally but definitely from a revenue point of view over time.\nTony Skiadas: Thanks. Hi Bryan. So on free cash flow, overall the cash generation of the business continues to be very strong. In the first half of the year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up 7% and we were able to grow cash flow in the second quarter, even with an incremental $1.7 billion in cash taxes. And as we said in April, we expect free cash flow to have a similar shape to last year and build throughout the year. And we still see the same puts and takes on free cash flow for the full year, as we described back in January. And within that framework, we see slightly more incremental pressure from cash taxes. And offsetting that is the lower upgrades, and we'll have to see where that goes. But overall, the strong position and cash flow puts us in a position to pay down debt in the second half of 2024, and we are on track to do so.\nBryan Kraft: Thanks very much.\nBrady Connor: Great. Brad that\u2019s all the time we have for today.\nOperator: This concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "VZ", "quarter": 1, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-04-22 12:01:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg, as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our investor relations website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website. Earlier this morning, we posted to our investor relations website a detailed review of our first quarter results. You'll find additional details in the earnings materials on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Hans.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we have started the year with a solid momentum, building on the progress we made throughout 2023. Our results this quarter further validate that our strategy is working and position us well for a profitable growth this year. Our execution in the first quarter keeps us on track towards our full year 2024 guidance, as we continue to deliver against our key financial metrics. We grew Wireless Service revenue and adjusted EBITDA and generated solid free cash flow. Operational Excellence is our priority. Our team is delivering. We have the right strategy, and we're working to keep this progress up quarter-by-quarter. It has been a busy quarter across our business. We produced big moments at the Super Bowl. Published our first consumer connections report, achieved milestones in our C-band rollout, added new members to our leadership team, published our annual ESG report, accomplished many goals with Citizen Verizon and completed a pension transaction that increases our financial flexibility. Verizon has a differentiated position in the industry. We have the highest quality customer base in consumer and business, the largest adjusted EBITDA, and a great team that knows how to execute our strategy. Turning to our first quarter results, Wireless Service revenue growth climbed to 3.3%. Our revenue performance combined with our work on cost efficiency programs translated to a $12.1 billion adjusted EBITDA, that's a year-over-year growth of 1.4%. We generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow and we expect free cash flow to build throughout the year, similar to 2023. Our core products on mobility, broadband and private networks are at the center of people's lives and businesses. Connectivity is only becoming more vital with each passing day, and our investments and world-class network ensure that our customers can depend on us to deliver the reliable, high-quality experience they deserve. Now, let me go into some specifics about this quarter. Our consumer team is executing extremely well. Despite taking further pricing action this quarter, our postpaid phone net adds performance improved year-over-year, evidence of how our differentiated value proposition is resonating with customers. Our net loss of 158,000 is more than 100,000 net adds better than our first quarter performance in 2023. This achievement was fueled by continued momentum in postpaid phone gross adds, which grew more than 5% year-over-year. We mitigated churn impacts from pricing actions through laser-focused retention efforts and the strength of our value proposition. These results represented Verizon Consumer Group's strongest first quarter postpaid phone net adds performance since 2018. Our targeted and segmented go-to-market approach, combined with myPlan and its exclusive perks, is clearly working. With myPlan, we are building a recurring revenue stream out of perks and services. These incentives, like our popular Netflix plus Max bundle, add value and deepen our customer relationships. We know our customers extremely well and tailor our offerings to their needs. We're bringing the same proven approach to our prepaid business. Within the quarter, we established our new value market leadership team, bringing in experts to execute our plans with speed and discipline. While there is still work to be done, we're seeing early signs of progress, in Visible and Total By Verizon. In February, we stopped processing new affordable connectivity program activations, which caused headwinds for our SafeLink brand. The ACP may shut down, but Verizon is committed to providing households with access to high-quality connectivity and reliable home internet without data caps, and does not believe that income should be a barrier to access. Since 2020 we have offered high speed home internet to qualifying customers for as low as $20 a month through our Verizon forward program and we have other plans to reach households who rely on ACP. For business mobility, postpaid phone net adds were 90,000. The team continues to put up subscriber growth as a market share leader in a competitive environment even while implementing pricing actions within the quarter. More businesses rely on Verizon than any other provider to deliver mission-critical support for their day-to-day operations. In total, first quarter post-paid phone net losses were 68,000, a 59,000 net loss improvement versus prior year. We're exiting the quarter with both consumer and business delivering their strongest performance in March, a good sign for the year ahead. Our broadband business continues to be a key growth engine, now serving more than 11 million subscribers. We have grown our base 18% over the last year and our network is a critical part of the infrastructure that homes and businesses rely on. Fixed wireless access has turned out to be a large and growing opportunity. This is now a meaningful piece of our business. We knew that fixed wireless access would be a hit with consumers who like its quality, reliability and easy setup. Businesses are showing similar excitement as this was our biggest quarter-to-date for the net adds in business fixed wireless access with 151,000 setting our new high. Fios remains extremely popular, with one of the highest third-party net promoters scored in the industry. And as we already know, Fios is the best pure broadband offering in the country. Together, Our total broadband portfolio delivered a strong quarter with 389,000 net adds. As with mobility, we saw good momentum with the broadband net adds as we exited the quarter and we expect that to continue. We also had a great quarter in private networks, signing transformative deals across industries. Xerox selected our Network and Service solution as its framework for modernizing its information technology system. We also signed a new private network deal with the global power solution leader, Cummins Inc. And iconic American sport leagues are turning to us for the networks that serve their fans, players, and coaches. We're on the field, on the aisles, and in the stands, and in the parking lots. During the quarter, we held a partner summit where we unveiled our sports and entertainment strategy. We are at the center of the culture moments that matter the most to our customers, from concerts and performance to athletic achievements and competition. We're already in every National Football League stadium in the country. We're now expanding services with NFL teams, including the installation of a private 5G network at the L.A. Chargers Training facility. We also renewed our partnership as the official 5G network of the National Hockey League in the United States and are expanding services throughout its arenas. As you may have seen in our consumer connection report during the \u201823-\u201824 NFL season, the average fan used more data than the year before. These live moments matter to our customers and they want to share them by text, by phone and by video. We are a vital part of their experiences. Our private networks business is growing and full of long-term contracts with the best partners around the world. All of this is supported by the infrastructure we have built and are building. We operate the nation's most reliable and robust network for all customers from households to global enterprises. Recently, we passed 250 million POPs covered with C-Band, achieving our target almost a year ahead of plan. The pace and quality of our build out is spectacular. And most importantly, our customers love the C-band experience. In the first 76 markets where we rolled out C-band, we see a higher premium mix and reduced churn. Our strategy from the start was to build a network once, to meet the needs of the present, and to optimize it for the future, and we're doing just that. We have been working with AI for several years, and our powerful network position Verizon to lead the AI revolution. In 2023, we released a set of responsible AI principles to guide our efforts to leverage new AI technologies in ways that positively impact our stakeholders and establish Verizon, as a trusted brand and partner with respect to AI. Enabling AI at scale for improved customer service is a key. We're also aggressively driving AI transformative potential with our businesses, something our network was built to support. We already had several generative AI projects going live. Our AI strategy focuses on three priorities. First, optimizing internal processes and operations through machine learning, such as creating efficiencies in fuel consumption. AI is already centered to our cost transformation program and will become even more important over time. Secondly, enhancing product experiences with AI capabilities like the personalized plan recommendation on myPlan, which is producing good early results. And thirdly, establishing an AI-based revenue stream by commercializing our network's unique low latency, high bandwidth, and robust mobile edge compute capabilities. Generative AI workloads represent a great long-term opportunity for us. As we expand our network and increase our performance advantage, we're also making Verizon a more efficient organization. We are back to business as usual level on CapEx spend, as we had promised. And we have struck a balance between profitable growth and free cash flow that supports both our dividend and a stronger balance sheet. This gives us greater flexibility to accelerate deleveraging throughout the second half of the year, bringing us closer to our long-term leverage targets. Our dividend is healthy and secure, and our free cash flow dividend payout ratio continues to improve. We are focused on putting our board in a position to continue to raise the dividend each year, building on our current industry record of 17 consecutive increases. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss our financial and operational performance in more detail. Tony.\nTony Skiadas : Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong execution of our team, building on the momentum from 2023 and delivering solid results in our three priorities of Wireless Service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. We saw further improvements in postpaid phone net adds and another strong quarter of growth in our broadband subscriber base. We accomplished this while maintaining our promotional discipline as evidenced by our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.4% and more than 16% year-over-year free cash flow growth. Consumer post-paid phone net losses were 158,000 for the quarter, better versus the prior year by 105,000, driven by improvements in both gross adds and churn. As Hans mentioned, this represents our best first quarter performance in consumer post-paid phone net adds since 2018. We continue to see improved operational performance with consumer post-paid phone gross adds up more than 5% year-over-year. And as you heard from Hans, we exited the quarter with good momentum. The changes we made over the last few quarters, including launching a regional sales structure and updating our sales compensation plans, provide the right framework for our go-to-market approach. We believe these changes, combined with the continued success of myPlan and increased utilization of C-band, will help us sustain our momentum. Consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.83% represents a 1 basis point improvement year-over-year. This result is a reflection of the strength of our value proposition, as well as our high quality customer base. The first quarter post-paid phone net add improvement coincided with a further decline in upgrades, which were down nearly 21% year-over-year. We continue to see success with our disciplined and segmented approach to customer offers in alignment with our strategy. On the business side, we delivered 90,000 postpaid phone net adds. Business volume results were challenged early in the quarter as the team implemented pricing increases in January. However, we saw positive net add momentum built throughout the quarter and we exited the quarter well positioned to continue to build on operational improvements in both mobility and broadband. That sales performance helped Verizon business achieve fixed wireless access net adds of 151,000, their best quarterly result to-date. We've been pleased with how businesses have adopted FWA and we continue to see strong demand from small businesses and enterprises which are attracted to the ease of deployment, reliability, and the flexibility of the product. Fixed wireless net adds for consumer were 203,000 resulting in a consolidated total of 354,000. This reflects the attractiveness of FWA as an alternative to traditional cable broadband, even in the market that saw muted activity. We continue to be comfortable with this pace of growth, believing it provides the right combination of base growth, ARPU accretion, and the superior experience our customers expect on the Verizon network. And our third-party Net Promoter Scores for our FWA product continue to outpace traditional cable broadband offerings, as we remain focused on building a long-term sustainable business. Overall, broadband net adds were 389,000, including 53,000 Fios Internet net adds. We're pleased with how Fios continues to grow in the marketplace, even as move activity across the country remains lower than prior years. We finished the quarter with over 11.1 million broadband subscribers, including over 3.4 million on FWA. We've now added more than 3 million broadband subscribers in the last two years alone. On prepaid, starting this quarter, we are disclosing subscriber results with and without our SafeLink brand. This disclosure provides improved transparency into our prepaid results. As a reminder, SafeLink is our government subsidy program brand offering and holds the majority of our ACP customers. The actions we've taken to scale Visible and Total by Verizon, as well as address operational execution with Straight Talk, drove improvements in our prepaid performance. Prepaid net losses excluding SafeLink were better by 146,000 year-over-year. While we are pleased to see the improvements, we still have work to do to address challenges in the prepaid business. That includes navigating the uncertainty around ACP, and we recently announced plans to provide accessible, affordable, and reliable connectivity options for those who need it most. As a reminder, we have approximately 1.1 million prepaid ACP subscribers as of the end of the first quarter. We expect the elimination of the program to result in lower wireless service revenue but have minimal impact on our adjusted EBITDA. Moving to our financials, consolidated revenue for the quarter was $33 billion, up 0.2% year-over-year. The benefits of the pricing actions we took in the quarter, combined with improved operating metrics, offset the year-over-year decrease in wireless equipment revenue due to lower upgrades. Wireless service revenue growth was 3.3% for the first quarter. This represents a significant acceleration in our revenue growth as the full year 2023 growth rate, excluding the reallocation of certain revenues, was only 1.3%. Consumer led the way with wireless service revenue growth of 3.4%, driven by ARPA growth of 4.4%, and improved year-over-year postpaid phone net add performance. In addition to targeted pricing actions, ARPA continues to benefit from the further adoption of myPlan. myPlan has been instrumental in growing our premium mix, which now stands at 42% of our postpaid phone base. We're also starting to see a growing impact from perk revenue as we scale the number of subscriptions. With over 20% of the postpaid base on myPlan, we see further opportunities for ARPA accretion as we expect to double the number of customers on myPlan in our postpaid base by the end of this year. For the first time, we are disclosing fixed wireless access revenue within our externally released results. FWA revenue, which is included in wireless service revenue, was $452 million for the quarter, up nearly $200 million versus the prior year. Headwinds in prepaid revenue continue to partially offset the gains from ARPA performance in wireless service revenue. For the quarter, prepaid revenue declined $106 million versus the prior year. While this is an improvement over the prior quarter, it represented an approximately 60 basis point drag on total wireless service revenue growth. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was approximately $12.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 1.4% compared to the prior year driven by the growth in wireless service revenue, as well as the impact of lower upgrade volumes. With a full quarter's impact from our recent pricing actions, we anticipate the second quarter's adjusted EBITDA growth to accelerate year-over-year. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items were down 0.5% year-over-year. Lower cost of equipment and cost of services were partially offset by an increase in SG&A. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.15, down 4.2% compared to the prior year, as gains in adjusted EBITDA were more than offset by higher interest expense, predominantly due to the lower capitalized interest, now that a large portion of the C-band spectrum licenses have been placed into service. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up over 16% or nearly $400 million from the first quarter of 2023. On a full year basis, nothing has changed. With free cash flow, we still expect the same puts and takes we shared with you in January. As Hans said, we expect free cash flow to build throughout the year, similar to 2023. Cash flow from operating activities came in at $7.1 billion. Within the quarter, we saw year-over-year pressures from higher interest expense, primarily related to the reduction in capitalized interest. We also made a discretionary pension contribution of $365 million prior to the closing of the retiree pension annuity transaction that we previously disclosed. CapEx for the quarter was $4.4 billion compared to $6 billion in the prior year as a result of our return to BAU levels of spend and historical levels of capital intensity. Our full year guidance of $17 billion to $17.5 billion in CapEx spending remains unchanged. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126 billion, a $3.7 billion improvement year-over-year, and a nearly $400 million improvement sequentially. During the quarter, we issued our sixth green bond for $1 billion with proceeds committed to fund additional renewable energy purchases. Net unsecured debt was also impacted by payments of approximately $270 million related to clearance of our C-band spectrum licenses, which are now substantially complete. While these payments do not affect our free cash flow, they are a use of cash. Our net unsecured debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times in-line with the previous quarter. Given the strength and momentum of our business, we continue to see a clear path to meaningfully delever the balance sheet in the second half of this year. In closing, I'm happy with our start to 2024, and our results from the first quarter set us up well to deliver on our financial guidance for the year. Our disciplined approach continues to put us in a strong position to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Our focus remains on driving operational improvements throughout the year. With that, I will now turn the call back to Hans for his closing thoughts before opening the call up for your questions.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Tony. I'm proud of our team and pleased with our financial and operational performance in the first quarter. We exited the quarter with good momentum across the business positioning us well for the year ahead. We're [scaling] (ph) fixed wireless access and private networks while growing our core mobility business. Our disciplined, targeted and segmented consumer strategy continues to prove itself. And we will apply the same level of energy and execution to the prepaid market. Network excellence drives our business forward and we will not let up on that. Our consistent network investment puts us in an unmatched position to deliver AI services at scale. Finally, our cash flow generation is solid. This shows that we are executing well against our financial objectives. Our cash flow strength allows us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, including supporting our dividend and paying down our debt. With strong momentum already in the start of the second quarter, I'm confident in our ability to sustain progress towards unlocking Verizon's full potential for all stakeholders. Now, Brady, we are ready to take questions.\nBrady Connor : Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Sir, please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much and good morning. Hans, maybe we can talk about the consumer a little bit. It was good to see the churn number. Perhaps you'd just talk a little bit about the impact of the pricing there. It seems like it had a drag on business but less of a drag on consumer. And just -- what are you seeing overall in the wireless market growth, it seems like the industry is continuing to grow, there's been some competitive moves by some of the cable companies recently, maybe just comment on the overall environment out there and your ability to sustain this, as well as the low upgrade rates. And then just a quick one, Tony, for you on cash flow. Thank you for the comments around the pacing through the year. Could you just talk about working capital and the impact this quarter? It seemed like there were some drags from that on the quarterly number. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Simon. Let me start with the consumer business. As we saw in the quarter, it was a little bit slow in the beginning of the quarter both for consumer and for business when it comes to wireless. But then I think we clearly see that our products are resonating with the customers. And on the consumer side, myPlan is really doing well. And as Tony said in the prepared remarks, the Perks is now coming up. Our premium is also increasing. So clearly, we see that. At the same time, the team has spent a lot of time to be disciplined both with promotions and churn management. And you saw we had the price up in the quarter on consumer that was pretty wide. But our team actually kept the churn down on the consumer side. I mean, it shows first of all how great our product is, but also see how well we're using the AI tools and all of that to see that our customers are getting the value and we are actually directing the money to the right customers. That's what you see coming out in the financial discipline in everything we're doing. Yeah, the promotions were lower again this quarter. But again, it's a way for us to segment the market to see that we have the right products. And that's what I've seen for quite a while right now on the consumer side. And what I said also is that -- we have said several times right now, we expect consumer to be positive net add this year. So they are doing it. And [Sampath] (ph) team probably have even more innovations coming. And when myPlan was one, the Perks and other, they have more things to come during the year. So I'm really excited about what we're doing on the wireless side. And of course competition is the same. There's nothing new, but it's the same as we've seen for quite a while. But we just performed way better. We have the right product, we have the right people, we have made the right changes in operation model and that's what we're seeing right now. And now we move all that into prepaid and you saw that we're also doing prepaid better but still we have more to be done. The team has their heads down, very focused on execution. Very pleased with what they've seen so far. That doesn't mean we're not going to push even harder going forward. Tony?\nTony Skiadas : Yeah, sure. So good morning, Simon. So a couple of points on churn. So the results on C-band are significantly better. We see, you know, strong churn performance, higher premium mix, and also higher gross adds in C-band markets. And, you know, overall in 2024, it's reasonable to expect similar or lower churn in the consumer business compared to 2023. And then on your cash flow question, in the prepared remarks, we said that free cash flow would have a similar shape to last year and build throughout the year. We do expect free cash flow to be up meaningfully in the second quarter. We still see the same puts and takes on free cash flow for the full year as we described in January. So nothing's really changed there. On your question on the quarter, let me start with operating cash flow and let me unpack that for you. So we saw the discretionary pension contribution in the quarter. That was $365 million in connection with the pension annuitization transaction that we announced in early March. As we said previously, the lower capitalized interest from C-band now manifests itself in operating cash flow, and that was about $300 million higher year-over-year. And the third point I'd make is, you know, we're funding the business for growth and very, very confident in our ability to execute and you saw that again. You saw the growth in the fourth quarter with strong gross adds and we followed that up with 5% gross add growth in the consumer business in the first quarter. And with that growth comes working capital timing that will settle in the second quarter. But overall we're very confident in the cash generation of the business and nonetheless we expect to generate strong free cash flow and we see no obstacles in paying down debt in a meaningful way in the second half of 2024.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot of Tony.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks Brad. We're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks and good morning, guys. First, just a couple of quick follow-ups on Simon's question. For number one, the positive commentary you guys talked about with March, does that suggest you guys could be positive in terms of consumer phone adds in the second quarter. That's number one. Number 2, the price increase seemed to be digested pretty well and you actually saw churn come down. Does that suggest you guys have more pricing power than you thought and we could see, and maybe not just for you but for the industry, and we could see more in the future that's number two. And then on ACP, I noticed you guys announced some new plans with free sort of low-end plans on the broadband side with free service for six months. You've talked about some of the headwinds as ACP goes away, but do you believe that there's an opportunity to potentially win some broadband subs as that plays out? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, John. On the first question there on consumer net adds in the short-term, I stay on my previous comment. Consumer net adds should be positive in 2024. The team is of course doing quite good right now. Actually 100,000 better in the first quarter here on net adds. Let them continue to execute. They have a great product that resonates with the market. And they will continue to execute well on that. On the churn side, I think first of all, I mean, if you look at the market, of course we see both inflation and -- a higher interest rate. But think about the product, first of all, so good right now. Everybody needs wireless and broadband. And I think that -- that has improved quite dramatically over the last couple of years. Secondly, our products right now are so well segmented for different segments, for different groups. And thirdly, we're laser focused \u2013 on churn management. The team with Sampath, the AI tools we have, so we actually spend on the right customers when we see they have a churn. So all that came together despite that we had a price adjustment that was large in the consumer group in the second quarter. The same goes for our business wireless. They performed well in the quarter. They had a little bit slow in the beginning of the year, but ramped really nicely also in the quarter. And again, they are market share leader on the wireless and they continue to be positive. So I'm pleased with that. On the ACP, I will let Tony comment on it. The only thing I want to say, I think -- we think it's important that everyone in these countries should be able to have wireless and broadband because it's such an essential service today. So that's why we historically already have plans on Fios that are for low income families, but also the whole prepaid family of products we have is also addressing that. Again, going back to -- being able to support that regardless if it's the recent ACP or not, but our segmentation model. And lastly, I think on the churn, our high quality customers, which is best in industry, that is really playing out in this environment with the products we have. Tony?\nTony Skiadas: Sure. And John, good morning. So in terms of ACP, we stopped enrollments in February and still accepting transfers through May. As we said previously and -- in the prepared remarks, the majority of the exposure is in the prepaid business, and we have 1.1 million prepaid subs that are in the ACP program. We've said previously that the guidance assumed that the ACP funding stays intact. The impact or any impact would be seen on service revenue up to potential 50 basis points of headwind. And the margin exposure from ACP is actually very small. It was insignificant in the first quarter. And if nothing changes and the funding goes away in May, as is planned, then we have plans in place to address it, both from retention and potential acquisition opportunities as well. And obviously we'll continue to help everybody -- update everybody as we know more.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks guys.\nBrady Connor: Okay thanks John. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open sir.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I was curious if you could unpack a bit more of how you're thinking about the up-tiering opportunities within the post-paid phone base. And as you look at the Perks, is there a way that we should think about the revenue contribution from Perks and where that can go over time as an incremental way for Verizon to monetize the base?\nHans Vestberg : Hey, thanks Mike. Yeah, This is a long-term strategy of us. First of all, we have a great base of customers. We want to give them the flexibility on the consumer side. Then we add in the Perks. Of course, all that plays into value play for our customers, even though we up tier our customers. And that has gone very well. We said in the prepared remarks that almost a quarter of our customers have myPlan right now and we are expecting it to go to almost or go to half of the base, which is never had a product moving that fast because it resonates with the market. In there -- we have opportunities for both up-tiering and then adding services, all incremental for our bottom-line and accretive. And many of these offerings are savings for our customers which is just great. The Max-Netflix is for example a great saving, great product. We are the only one in the market that can do that on wireless. It's exclusive. And that's the type of things we do on Perks, very different rather. I wouldn't say shocked, but I would be at least surprised if Sampath and the consumer team doesn't continue to think how they can enlighten our customers even more with these type of things going forward. Tony.\nTony Skiadas: Sure. And Mike, just a couple other points. So we did see 4.4% ARPA growth in the first quarter. And as Hans talked about in myPlan, the premium mix is very strong. It's 42% of the lines in the base. And the Perk attach rates have steadily increased and then will continue to increase. So we feel really good about that and the discipline we see on promotions as well and keeping the amortization pressure in check.\nMichael Rollins: And one other if I could, operational efficiency. It sounds like a few times where they were talking about AI or just the broader focus on the operations, that this is an important priority for Verizon this year. Can you frame how much of the cost-cutting Verizon can deliver this year relative to the multi-year target that the company has established? And are there any milestones that we should be looking for that will signify some further progress on these initiatives?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. First of all, we're on track for our cost target that we have given to the market -- to The Street. Secondly, many of the larger sort of transactions and platform transactions we started already last year, the outsourcing to ATL, the customer care changes we did, which are large transactions, without any interruptions for our customers who have done those, they are coming into the base in 2024 and of course, full year \u201825. Then what I'm adding now is our opportunities in AI. Many of these things, of course, already thought about, but of course we see a great opportunity with AI to serve our customers better. We are already using, for example, personalization in myPlan with AI, and we are using it in our network when it comes to performance of the capacity deployment, as well as power consumption. So we are using AI and generative AI already now commercially. So this is not the playing ground for us. We just see more opportunities. On the flip side, of course we also see revenues. Our network was built for AI. That was my thought when I built Verizon Intelligent Edge Network five years ago or six years ago, that we're going to have compute and storage at the Edge. AI is sort of built for that with the low latency we have on the 5G network. And as we are deploying our 5G right now, with the mobile edge compute and AI, this is a great long-term opportunity for us using AI. So there are multiple places we see efficiencies, but also revenue opportunities with all the new technologies coming. Tony, anything else on the savings?\nTony Skiadas: Yeah, Mike, just to add a couple of things. So obviously, as Hans said, we're on track with the savings program, and those savings were contemplated in the guide. We're not going to discuss specific cost targets, but as Hans mentioned, we're operating a lot differently, and we feel really good about the cost actions that we're taking and the progress that we're making that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you saw in the first quarter and that we expect throughout 2024.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks Mike. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Hans, maybe one industry question for you. There's obviously a lot of assets up for sale, some smaller ones, some potentially bigger ones. There's also been talk about your potential interest in maybe partnering with ESPN in some form. Could you talk about how you see the industry structure evolving from here? Do you see this as some kind of equilibrium? Or is there any need for -- or an opportunity from your perspective in terms of balancing your asset base in a slightly different direction. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Kannan, thank you for the question. First of all, I think I said it in the beginning of the year, we're getting into a phase of the heavy investment, a lot of changes in our asset structure. We're coming into a phase where we have all the assets we need and we're executing on it. And you see the operation excellence coming out from it the last three quarters. I have a team that in many facets have actually changed quite a lot. We added two new team members this quarter. I feel really good where we stand with assets right now and how we're executing. And of course I can never say never to look into assets. That's my fiduciary responsibility. But I rather right now execute on what I have. And you see the performance when we have that with the C-band millimeter wave, the broadband growth we have, almost 400,000 again this quarter. So that's my main focus. When it comes to some of the other things, at the end you mentioned, I think we are using our base of distribution to actually work with all the streaming services. And we are uniquely positioned. We have the biggest distribution or direct-to-consumer in the market. We are taking leverage that for our customers and for our shareholders, but also seeing that we help some of these larger streaming services to see that they get better churn and of course better access to the best consumer base in the United States of America. So we will continue to do that and see that we're doing it in the right way. But again, I'm pleased with the asset base we have today.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Great.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Kannan. Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one was just about the kind of the balance of revenue growth. I think that you guys talked about kind of a 60-40 balance of pricing and volumes is more normal. And over the last year it was more skewed to pricing. I was wondering if you could kind of talk about the relatively healthy 5% growth in gross adds versus what we're watching this quarter happened which is a decline in accounts. Could you talk a little bit about how you balance the relationship between accounts and gross new subscribers? And then the second question is just more of a housekeeping question which is you guys introduced the second number add-on this past quarter. There's been a lot of questions about where does that show up in the numbers. I'm guessing not in the sub-numbers. It\u2019s probably -- could you kind of elaborate about -- where we find that in the numbers? Thank you so much.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, David. First of all, our team is very focused to continue to get a little bit more of volume in the consumer side. Remember, on the business side, we're already in there. We are taking customers every quarter. We have done it for not sure how many quarters. So it's a little bit different dynamic on the service -- on the consumer side, we actually had a little bit more challenge in 2022. I think since second quarter 2023 with our myPlan and offerings, you see a constant improvement how we are actually addressing our customers. So I'm really pleased with that. But we have said, or Sampath has said on the consumer side, he want to have more on the volume side than only on the value side from customers. But that doesn't mean we will continue to get more value with our customers and what we're doing. On the second line, the only thing I want to say there, first of all, the innovation the team is doing right now is based on our strategy. We build a network once and we want as many profitable connections on the network in order to have the lowest return or the best return on invested capital in the industry. It's just playing straight into that narrative and this, of course, is accretive and we would take the second-line any given time. So again, you show the innovation and I'm prepared to see or I'm ready to see even more innovation from my team going forward. Tony.\nTony Skiadas: Yes, so Dave, on the second number, it is included in the line counts. I mean, the one thing we would say is it gives customers flexibility. They can add and remove it as desired. The adoption so far has been good, just a few points on that. It was very low single digit percentage of phone gross adds in the quarter for consumer. And we believe there's a limited market for this. As Hans said, it's ARPA and revenue accretive and it's high margin business. There's no incremental device. There's no incremental data usage and the results in the quarter reflect the strength of our core business. So we -- as Hans said, we would take this profitable connection any day of the week.\nHans Vestberg : And it goes back to the things -- the three things that I talked about that we are measured on from our shareholders, from our board and how I measure my management team. It's a service revenue growth, it's EBITDA and cash flow expansion. That's what we're measuring. Then it's 100 different measurements inside there. But those three are what we're incentivized on, and that's how we run our business.\nDavid Barden: Got it. And just to be totally clear, Tony, so of the five-point something gross add growth year-over-year in the quarter, maybe 1% or 2% of that was the second number add-ons, which might not continue because there's a finite market for that.\nTony Skiadas : We said it was a very low single digit percentage of phone gross adds, yes.\nDavid Barden: Perfect. Okay, thank you.\nBrady Connor: All right, Brad, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sebastiano Petti of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to see if you could give us an update on what you're seeing in the overall consumer broadband and particularly within consumer fixed wireless. Net adds did -- slow a little bit sequentially year-on-year. Obviously, the backdrops you called out the move environment remains a little bit challenged. Are you seeing incremental competition as AT&T Internet Air perhaps ramps up, even though maybe T-Mo is talking about a little bit of a slowdown there. That would be helpful. And then also touching upon, Hans, thinking about your thoughts on 5G use cases. I think you emphasized private networks a few times within the prepared remarks. How are you thinking about the development of the revenue opportunity here, maybe relative to how you're thinking about [MEC] (ph) as well, you kind of touched on that -- how AI plays into it. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you Sebastiano. Yeah, when we talk about the broadband, first of all I think Fios continue to be the stellar product, best fiber product in the market, both for businesses and for consumer. You see us continue -- it's a little bit up and down depending on mover markets and all of that, but we are very consistent on growth in that area, very pleased with that product. On the fixed wireless access, we continue to see very, very good net promoter score, the easiness of installing it, the greatness of the product, the quality of the product, all that plays in. So I just see that when we roll out our C-band we get new opportunities. On the consumer side, that we saw of course as an obvious use case. On the business side, we're seeing new use cases that we didn't see before. I mean, all the way from coffee shops replacing cable with fixed wireless access to large enterprises actually replacing with fixed wireless access as well for different use cases. So we had a super quarter in fixed wireless access in the business side this quarter. But again, we are dimensioning ourselves to be around 400 net adds quarter-by-quarter. That's how Joe, our Head of Network, is deploying the capital, the resources so we can handle it. So we're again pleased with that. We said it also was a little bit slower broadband market in the beginning of the year. The exit rates were better at the end of the quarter. So all-in-all good. On the 5G use cases, yeah, now we start talking more and more about private networks because the number of them are many -- then the value of them are still fairly small. But you know, when we build that base of private network, managed spectrum for enterprises, that's over time is going to be a great opportunity for our enterprise sales force to add in, do the mobile edge compute. And as I said, AI is like, that's how we built our mobile edge compute network. And we already have mobile edge compute in many of our sites across the country in order to be able to meet that compute and storage. So over time, long-term, and we are a long term company. We're going to be around for many, many years being telecoms. This is absolutely the right investment. Nobody else has built a network as we have done when it comes to AI network compute storage at the edge on the wireless network.\nBrady Connor: Thanks, Sebastiano. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks, guys. Tony, how sustainable do you think the 4% ARPA growth is? It seems like you have a lot of -- lot of levers to pull here, and it sounds like you're feeling a little bit more optimistic about that metric longer-term. And can you be just a little bit more specific in, you know, how much debt you kind of plan on paying down per year, maybe second half of this year or next year? Thank you.\nTony Skiadas : Sure. So on the ARPA growth, again you see the progress on gross adds and you saw the 5% growth on gross adds. You see the progress with myPlan and the continued premium mix has been very, very strong on myPlan, and that's continued. We see a further runway for growth, and you saw it in the first quarter. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we'll see a full quarter's effect of the pricing changes that we announced in the consumer business. And that launched in March. You'll see a full quarter's effect in the second quarter. So we feel very good about the progress on ARPA and that the team is making. And then on your second question, I'm sorry?\nTimothy Horan: How much debt do you think you can pay down per year? And just on ARPA, I guess the question is -- is this sustainable over a multi-year period? Thanks.\nTony Skiadas : Yeah, we're not going to give multiyear targets here, but we like the shape of the growth right now. We said we're on track with our service revenue growth through the year and the team is very focused on us. We said we were going to be phone net add positive in consumer and that's on track as well. And on the debt, so look, we're not going to give any targets on paying down debt. Our focus is on continuing to generate strong free cash flow to pay down debt in a meaningful way. In the second half of the year, we're on track to do that. We have 3.6 billion of unsecured maturities due this year. About half of that was addressed in the first quarter. And you should expect us to be opportunistic as the year goes on.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Tim. Brad, We're ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Let's talk about something a little longer-term, which is spectrum and capacity. Your CapEx has been now trending down as you've largely gotten through the 5G build. I'm just wondering how we should think about your spectrum needs going forward and what your appetite would be for additional spectrum if some were to come available from DISH Network or, if you think about US Cellular, and how you think about that in the context of the spectrum screens at the FCC, which don't really leave much room for incumbent players to add. Do you think that those are a real impediment or do you think that those would likely be adjusted when the time comes?\nHans Vestberg : Thank you Craig. Great question. First of all, as we all know, right now the FCC doesn't have any spectrum to auction out them -- and they don't even have an approval to do it. So that's sort of constrained. Then it could, of course be secondhand market spectrum. We feel good about -- we have only deployed a piece of our C-band so far. So we have quite a lot left in -- our many of the sites have 60 megahertz or maybe at best 80. We have 161 megahertz nationwide. So we have quite a lot left of spectrum. And remember, That was the decision I, together with the board, took. We bought spectrum for decades, not for the next two quarters or something like that. So we feel really good about it. Then any opportunistic spectrum coming up, it's hard to predict. And even on whatever regulation is going to be around screens and that. I don't know. The only thing I know, I've sit here on a better position ever say, with my millimeter way, my C-band, my low-band, and how I build a network. And sometimes it's opportunistic spectrum is going to cost me a lot both for my customer interaction because some spectrum is not in the devices. I need new radios, new software. So you need to think when you re-engineer the network to see that you have the right spectrum all the way up to the customer. And I think that no one is even close to our team or radio planning doing that. But all-in-all, we feel good about where we are today. Let's see what's going to happen in the market of spectrum.\nCraig Moffett : Hans, You've [seesawed] (ph) back over time between a preference between network densification or more spectrum. Is there a sort of house view at the moment for where you think it's most attractive to add capacity? Would it now be through network densification rather than Spectrum or vice versa?\nHans Vestberg : A little bit early to say, and ultimately it's actually a call or return on investment that we do daily here. Should we put up a new tower? Should we densify? Should we put up new elements? Or should we add more spectrum? That's a regional, almost on ZIP code level that the team is going through this. So every time you see spectrum coming out in the secondhand market historically, you make a calculation. We feel good about the position we have again here with all the spectrum we have to make those choices internally rather than betting on external assets coming in. We don't need that. We have everything in-house right now for quite a while.\nCraig Moffett : Thank you.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you, Craig.\nBrady Connor: Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Williams of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nGreg Williams: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. You provided some great color on ACP. I think you said it could be a 50 basis point hit. I'm just curious if we can drill down there. Is that more of an ARPU hit with these new plans that are coming out, or is it more on the disconnect side? Second question is just on fiber-to-the-home and the open access models that we're seeing. We've seen some news flow with Tillman and Intrepid, et cetera, on open access and maybe even T-Mobile. And just trying to gauge your appetite to ride some of these open access CapEx light models if they come to fruition. Thanks.\nHans Vestberg: I can take the first question -- the second question first. As we haven't done any open access deals yet, you can see that the appetite hasn't been that big. Anyhow, we're going to evaluate any type of opportunities that can fortify how we deliver to our customers. So far in this environment, with the very high capital cost, et cetera. It hasn't -- we haven't find a good return on investment on it. And again, we are very financially prudent. And remember, we have fixed wireless access, we have our Fios, we sort of -- we have [own this] (ph) economics on basically everything we're doing. That's why our return on investment is the highest in the industry and our EBITDA is the highest. We will continue to be disciplined. That doesn't mean I'm not going to look into other models, but right now there have not been any models that is appealing to me and the team and for our shareholders.\nTony Skiadas: And then Greg, on your question on ACPs, so as we said, it was up to a potential 50 basis points of headwind in service revenue. And that's a combination of ARPU and churn and it's lower ARPU. And we also said the margin exposure from ACP is also very, very small.\nGreg Williams: Got it. Thank you.\nBrady Connor: Yeah. Thanks, Greg. Brad we are ready for the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I had two if I could. First, could you provide an update on your efforts to pursue BEAD funding? Are you seeing any progress at the state level in establishing the rules? And based on what you are seeing there, are you more encouraged or discouraged by what you're seeing? And then separately, I was wondering if you could just provide any color on the company's performance in the first quarter within the larger metro markets relative to smaller mid-size markets and consumer. Thank you.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. On the BEAD funding, yeah, I think that has been widely reported in the press. It is of course a complicated process to get the BEAD money out, et cetera. So we bid where we see it makes sense with return on investment and the subsidy is coming in there. There are some other broadband money coming into the market from the previous funds which were winning. We just had some quite large wins here recently in Pennsylvania. So we're using it but we do it when it makes sense from a profitable point of view. But again, it's probably going to take some time when we see this money rolling out. Second question is for you. I [think you remember] (ph) \u2026\nTony Skiadas: Yes, it was the question on the C-band market. So on the C-band markets -- in the early markets, the performance is much better. As we said earlier, the churn is much better, 4 basis points better in churn. The premium mix is also a lot better, and we see meaningful increase in gross add performance as well. So we're really, really pleased with the performance in C-band.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you very much.\nBrady Connor: Yeah, thanks, Bryan. Brad, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nPeter Supino: Hi, good morning everybody. I wondered if you could talk about SG&A growth. It was up 11% in business and 4% in consumer. It was nicely offset by cost relief from lower upgrades. I'm just wondering if you're spending back some of that upside on SG&A and how we might think about modeling operating leverage and specifically SG&A going forward. And then if anybody would be willing to provide an update on your project of deploying millimeter wave spectrum in support of the FWA business to multi-dwelling units. Is that working the way you hope? And if so, could that provide upside to your long-term broadband growth targets? Thanks.\nHans Vestberg : Thank you. On the SG&A, we're very focused on seeing that we continue to get full leverage on the growth that we have right now. So the team is really focused on taking out costs. And I said, we are on track with that. We have a lot of initiatives ongoing. Tony will give you some more puts and takes on the SG&A in the quarter. On the millimeter wave MDU solution, that is progressing. We have said it will come in the second half, latter part of this year, in commercial. But we're piloting it right now and it's performing really well. So we feel really good about it. And it will over time, of course, add opportunity for us on MDUs that we haven't served with a fixed wireless access so far. So it will be an addition over time. Tony?\nTony Skiadas : Yeah, Peter, on your question on SG&A, some of that in the quarter is a function of the upfront work on transformation initiatives that will abate as the year progresses. And we also see pressure, year-over-year pressure on the handset insurance claims and we expect that to level off in the second quarter. We expect to see further operating leverage in the second half of the year.\nPeter Supino: Thank you very much.\nBrady Connor: Great, thanks Brad. That's all the time we have.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conferencing services. You may now disconnect."}]}
