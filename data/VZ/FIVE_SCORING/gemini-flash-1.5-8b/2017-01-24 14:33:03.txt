Verizon's earnings call highlighted a stable, but not spectacular, outlook for 2017.  While management emphasized continued network investments and a focus on customer retention,  revenue growth was anticipated to remain flat year-over-year.  The call doesn't indicate any significant short-term catalysts for stock price movement.
