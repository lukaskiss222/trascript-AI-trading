Verizon's earnings call highlighted short-term challenges in consumer wireless due to inflation and increased competition.  Management, however, emphasized proactive measures, including price adjustments and a new "Welcome Unlimited" plan, aiming to mitigate these pressures and improve performance in the second half of the year.  The company's focus on its robust network, innovative offerings (like private 5G and mobile edge compute), and continued growth in its business segment suggest a relatively positive outlook for the next few weeks, despite the near-term headwinds.
