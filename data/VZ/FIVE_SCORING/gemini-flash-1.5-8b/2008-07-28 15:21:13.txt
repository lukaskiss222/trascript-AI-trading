Verizon's earnings call highlights strong performance, particularly in wireless.  Management emphasized continued growth in FiOS, though some slower-than-expected video subscriber additions were noted; they believe improved marketing in the coming quarter will help.  The call also stressed resilience in the enterprise sector despite potential economic headwinds.  Overall, the call suggests a positive outlook for the short term, with potential for further stock price gains.
