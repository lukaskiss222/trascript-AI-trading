Verizon's Q2 2017 earnings call highlighted strong wireless performance, driven by robust customer retention and net adds.  Management emphasized the value proposition of their network, particularly with the introduction of their unlimited plans, and positive trends on churn and device activations.  Positive guidance on service revenue improving in the second half of the year, combined with continued focus on cost efficiency, suggests a likely positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
