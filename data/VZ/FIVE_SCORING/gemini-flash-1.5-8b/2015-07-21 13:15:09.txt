Verizon's earnings call highlights strong second-quarter performance, with double-digit earnings growth and robust cash flow.  Management emphasizes continued network investment, the positive impact of the AOL acquisition, and the strategic shift towards device installment plans (Edge).  While service revenue growth is somewhat muted due to this shift, the company projects strong revenue growth in the coming quarters, driven by the new video offerings and the Internet of Things, suggesting positive short-term momentum for the stock.
