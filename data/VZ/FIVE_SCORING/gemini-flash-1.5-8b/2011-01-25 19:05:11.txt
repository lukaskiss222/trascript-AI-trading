Verizon's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 performance, driven by robust Wireless growth, particularly in Smart phone sales and data ARPU.  Management expressed confidence in the 2011 outlook, emphasizing continued cost-cutting, network improvements (4G LTE), and increased FiOS penetration.  While guidance focused on a conservative 4-8% EPS growth in 2011,  implications suggest strong underlying performance across segments and potential for significant growth in the coming years.
