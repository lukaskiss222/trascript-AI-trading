Verizon's earnings call highlighted strong wireless performance, driven by increased adoption of their unlimited data plans and improved customer retention.  While wireline revenue showed a more modest growth, the company's focus on fiber expansion and the improving service revenue trajectory suggest continued progress in that segment. Management reiterated their strategic focus on 5G investments and network enhancements, indicating a strong outlook for the company's long-term growth.  This positive outlook, combined with consistent capital allocation and returning value to shareholders suggests a somewhat positive short-term impact on the stock price.
