Verizon's earnings transcript indicates a strong performance, particularly in wireless, driven by robust customer growth and increasing data usage.  Management highlighted the success of FiOS rollout and the positive momentum in the enterprise segment.  While wireline revenue saw sequential improvement, concerns persist about the margin pressure from FiOS expansion and access line losses.  Given the strong guidance and positive outlook across divisions, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the coming weeks.
