Verizon's Q2 2020 earnings call highlighted resilience in a challenging environment.  While revenue declined slightly, management emphasized positive trends in customer retention, especially in the Consumer segment, with strong postpaid growth and historically low churn.  Strong cash flow and a strengthened balance sheet, along with initiatives like the Keep Americans Connected pledge, suggest a proactive approach to navigating economic uncertainties.  Overall, the call suggests a positive short-term outlook, with increased 5G deployments and potential for strong sequential revenue growth, especially from the business sector.
