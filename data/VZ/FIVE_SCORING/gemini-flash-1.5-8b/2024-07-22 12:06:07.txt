Positive year-over-year and sequential growth in wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow signal a healthy business trajectory.  Management's focus on customer-centric initiatives like myPlan and myHome, coupled with successful network expansions (C-band), positions Verizon for continued growth, especially in the enterprise market.
