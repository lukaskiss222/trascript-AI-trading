Verizon's Q1 2012 earnings call highlighted strong wireless performance, with accelerated retail service revenue and postpaid ARPU growth driven by smartphone adoption.  Management emphasized continued execution and confidence in achieving guidance, while also mentioning a disciplined approach to capital spending.  The call also touched upon strategic repositioning in Wireline, including the rationalization of less-strategic products and a focus on FiOS expansion.  Short-term implications likely include continued stock price appreciation based on the strength in wireless and positive management commentary.
