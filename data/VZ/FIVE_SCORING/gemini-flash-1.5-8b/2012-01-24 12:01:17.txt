Verizon's earnings call highlighted strong fourth-quarter results, driven by record smartphone sales and 4G LTE adoption.  Management expressed confidence in 2012 growth, projecting adjusted EPS of $2.20, exceeding expectations though falling just short of the initial 2011 EPS growth forecast.  The company's focus on cloud services and its continued market leadership position in 4G LTE suggest upside potential.
