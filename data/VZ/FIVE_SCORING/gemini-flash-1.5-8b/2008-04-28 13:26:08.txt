Verizon's Q1 2008 earnings call highlights strong performance across all segments, driven by robust wireless growth, especially in data usage, and accelerating FiOS adoption. Management emphasizes the company's ability to navigate economic uncertainty, with continued double-digit EPS growth and margin expansion.  While some enterprise contracts shifted revenue, management anticipates a return to higher growth rates.  This positive outlook and strong operational performance suggest a continued positive short-term impact on the stock price.
