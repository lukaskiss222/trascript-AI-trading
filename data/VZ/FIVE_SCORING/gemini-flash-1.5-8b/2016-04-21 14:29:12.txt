Verizon's Q1 2016 earnings call highlighted a transition to a more unsubsidized pricing model, affecting service revenue, but with positive signals on customer retention and margin expansion.  Management highlighted investments in video content and the Internet of Things, and a continued focus on cost-cutting and network improvements, including the planned acquisition of XO Communications for fiber expansion.  While revenue pressures are evident in the near term, the long-term growth strategy, particularly in video and IoT, suggests potential for positive stock price movement over the next couple of weeks.
