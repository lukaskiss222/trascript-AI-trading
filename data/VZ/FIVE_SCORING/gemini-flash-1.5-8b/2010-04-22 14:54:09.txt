Verizon's Q1 2010 earnings show continued growth in wireless, driven by strong data revenue and smart phone upgrades.  Management highlighted improved sequential revenue growth in both wireless and wireline, and expressed optimism regarding an economic recovery's positive impact on the enterprise segment. However, wireline revenue remains pressured, and significant cost-cutting measures are planned to improve margins. The company expects to see better results in the second half of the year as the economy continues to improve.
