Verizon's Q2 2012 earnings call highlighted strong wireless performance, record EBITDA margins, and significant free cash flow generation.  Management emphasized continued execution on their strategy of balancing growth and profitability, particularly in wireless, with cost management and product rationalization initiatives in wireline.  The call suggests a short-term focus on improving wireline margins, although some declines in wholesale and enterprise are expected to continue.  Given the positive momentum and strong financial results, a positive stock reaction over the next few weeks seems likely.
