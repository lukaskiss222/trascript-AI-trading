Verizon's earnings call highlights strong Q3 performance, driven by wireless service growth and operational efficiencies.  Management emphasized the importance of 5G, and the upcoming rollout, but also acknowledged continued pressure in the wireline segment and a moderate slowdown in Oath revenue.  The positive guidance and focus on cost efficiencies suggest the stock will maintain a positive trend over the next two weeks.
