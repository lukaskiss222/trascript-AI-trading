Verizon's earnings call highlights strong second-quarter performance, driven by increased wireless service revenue and adjusted EBITDA.  Management expressed confidence in meeting full-year guidance, emphasizing the positive impact of the myPlan initiative and continued momentum in broadband subscriber additions.  The discussion of planned price increases and a disciplined approach to promotions suggests a  potential for continued growth in the second half of the year.  However, the lead cable issue remains a short-term uncertain factor and requires further investigation by the company.
