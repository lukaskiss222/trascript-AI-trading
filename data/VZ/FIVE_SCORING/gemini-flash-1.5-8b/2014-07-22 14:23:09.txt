Verizon's Q2 2014 earnings call highlights strong financial performance, driven by significant wireless growth and improved wireline margins.  Management's emphasis on customer choice, particularly with the Verizon Edge program, and continued investment in 4G infrastructure suggests continued positive momentum.  The company's strong cash flow positions them well for future investments, like the upcoming AWS-3 spectrum auction, implying a likely positive short-term impact on the stock due to these factors.
