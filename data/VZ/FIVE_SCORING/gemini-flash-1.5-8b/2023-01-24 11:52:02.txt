Verizon's earnings call highlights strong 2022 performance, exceeding targets set in July, including a positive consumer phone net add outlook for Q4.  Management projects continued growth in 2023, driven by robust mobility (including a surge in broadband subscribers) and capital efficiency from the declining C-band capital spending. The outlook incorporates anticipated pressures from higher interest rates and promo amortization, but emphasizes the resiliency of the customer base and continued focus on profitability.  The overall tone suggests cautious optimism regarding short-term challenges while maintaining a long-term growth strategy.
