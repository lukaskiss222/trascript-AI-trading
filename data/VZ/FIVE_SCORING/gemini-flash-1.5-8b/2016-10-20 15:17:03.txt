Verizon's Q3 2016 earnings call highlights a mixed picture.  While the company showed operational resilience and strong margins, the reported revenue decline and the impact of non-operational items like pension adjustments and divestitures complicate the short-term outlook.  Management's focus on long-term strategies like 5G, digital media, and IoT investments, along with the dividend increase, suggest a sustained commitment to shareholder value.  The short-term impact on the stock will likely depend on the market's interpretation of the revenue declines and whether investors feel reassured by management's strategic pronouncements.
