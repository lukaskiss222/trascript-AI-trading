**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Verizon Communications Inc. revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported strong performance in wireless and FiOS segments, with wireless revenues increasing by 7.6% and FiOS revenues growing by 60.3%. However, the economic downturn continued to impact the business, particularly in the wireline segment, where margins were affected by cyclical pressures and increased pension and OPEB costs. The management team expressed optimism about the future, highlighting the company's strong balance sheet, cash flow, and strategic initiatives, such as the integration of Alltel and the rollout of LTE services. The call also addressed concerns about the iPhone's impact on wireless churn and the potential for increased competition in the enterprise market. Overall, the call provided a balanced view of the company's performance and future prospects.

**Conclusion:**

While the company's strong performance in wireless and FiOS segments was encouraging, the ongoing economic pressures and margin challenges in the wireline segment could potentially limit near-term growth. The management's focus on cost reduction and strategic initiatives suggests that the company is well-positioned to weather the current economic downturn and capitalize on future growth opportunities. Given the mixed signals from the earnings call, the stock's short-term performance is likely to be influenced by market sentiment and any new developments related to the economic recovery or regulatory environment.
