### Analysis

Verizon Communications Inc. reported mixed results for the third quarter of 2022, with earnings per share of $1.17 on a GAAP basis, despite a $645 million pre-tax charge related to pension liabilities and amortization of intangible assets. The company saw wireless service revenue grow by 10% year-over-year, driven by the acquisition of TracFone and the effectiveness of its premium unlimited strategy. The company also reported a 5% increase in phone gross adds, with business adding 197,000 postpaid phone net adds. However, the company had to deal with higher churn rates due to its recent pricing actions, which were expected to have a temporary impact on churn.

### Conclusion

Verizon's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the temporary increase in churn rates and the impact of pension liabilities on earnings. However, the company's strong financial performance in the quarter, driven by wireless service revenue growth and improved gross adds, suggests that the stock may rally in the long term. The company's focus on cost-cutting measures, strategic expansions, and diversification efforts also indicate a commitment to long-term growth. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a neutral impact in the next 1-2 weeks, with potential for a positive impact as the company's actions begin to gain traction in the market.
