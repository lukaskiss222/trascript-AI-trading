**Analysis:**
Verizon's Q4 and full-year earnings call highlighted a mixed performance with strong revenue growth in wireless and wireline segments, driven by Fios and new businesses. However, there was a notable decline in wireless service revenue due to the shift to unsubsidized pricing and higher device payment take rates. The company's guidance for 2017 projects a flat revenue trajectory and an improvement in wireless service revenue trends, with a focus on maintaining strong margins.

**Conclusion:**
Verizon's stock is expected to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's ability to maintain strong margins and improve wireless service revenue trends. The company's focus on investing in its network and creating new platforms to monetize digital traffic growth also suggests long-term potential. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the new administration's regulatory policies and potential changes in the competitive landscape.
