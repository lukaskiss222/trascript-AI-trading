### Analysis

Verizon's Q2 2012 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to influence the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. The company reported strong financial performance, with notable growth in wireless and wireline segments. However, there were also some areas of concern, including the impact of economic pressures on the wireline business and the ongoing negotiations with unions. Additionally, the potential for future dividend distributions and share buybacks was discussed, but no concrete timeline was provided.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a positive impact due to the strong financial performance and growth prospects, particularly in the wireless segment. However, the uncertainty surrounding the union negotiations and the potential drag from the Italian asset could create some short-term volatility. Overall, the positive earnings and growth trajectory are expected to outweigh the negatives, leading to a positive impact on the stock price.
