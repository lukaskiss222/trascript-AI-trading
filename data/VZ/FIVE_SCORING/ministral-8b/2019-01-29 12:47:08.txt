**Analysis:**

Verizon's Q4 and full-year 2018 results were mixed, with strong financial performance but some headwinds. The company reported EPS of $0.47 per share for Q4 and $3.76 for the full year, driven by wireless service revenue growth and cost savings. However, the company also faced challenges such as the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, a higher effective tax rate, and increased interest expense from deploying more spectrum. The company expects low single-digit percentage growth in full-year 2019 consolidated revenue, with adjusted EPS expected to be similar to 2018, excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. The company also announced a voluntary separation program, which is expected to generate significant cost savings in 2019. Overall, the company's strategic priorities for 2019 include redoubling customer satisfaction, building on the momentum of 2018, extending 5G leadership, focusing on employees, and carrying forward Verizon's commitment to responsible business practices. The company also expects to launch 5G Home in the second half of 2019.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Verizon's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the company's strong financial performance and strategic priorities for 2019. The company's focus on cost savings, 5G leadership, and customer satisfaction should provide a tailwind for the stock, despite the challenges from the new revenue recognition standard and higher effective tax rate.
