**Analysis:**

Verizon's Q2 2008 earnings call highlights strong performance across all segments, with double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, and robust cash generation. The company's wireless division, particularly Verizon Wireless, continues to lead the market with impressive ARPU growth and low churn. The FiOS business is also performing well, with strong customer additions and penetration, although there are some short-term challenges related to promotions and market penetration. Verizon Business shows resilience in the face of economic uncertainty, with steady growth in strategic services and global enterprise revenues.

**Short-term (1–2 weeks) implications:**

1. **Positive Impact:** Verizon's strong performance and guidance for the second half of the year suggest that the stock could see a positive reaction in the short term, especially if the market continues to favor strong earnings reports and growth prospects.
2. **Negative Impact:** Any concerns about the economic slowdown and potential impact on enterprise business could weigh on the stock in the short term. Additionally, the union negotiations could also be a source of uncertainty.

**Conclusion:**

Given the strong performance and positive outlook, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the next 1–2 weeks. However, the potential risks related to the economic slowdown and union negotiations could temper the stock's reaction.

**Rating:** 1
