**Analysis:**

Verizon's earnings call for the second quarter of 2019 highlighted several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term. The company reported a 2.5% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the prior year, driven by strong wireless service revenue growth and operational efficiencies. However, the report also included headwinds from the deferral of commission expense and the adoption of new accounting standards, which created a year-over-year headwind of approximately 80 basis points.

Key highlights from the call include:

1. **Strong Wireless Performance:** Verizon's wireless service revenue grew by 3.1% in the second quarter, with strong performance in both consumer and business segments.
2. **Operational Efficiency:** The company's business excellence initiatives have realized cumulative cash savings of $4.1 billion since the program started in 2018, with additional savings expected in the third quarter.
3. **5G Expansion:** Verizon is on track to launch 30 5G markets by the end of the year, with strong momentum in the second quarter. The company also won the top third-party measurements for network performance.
4. **Fiber Deployment:** Verizon continues to expand its fiber network, with 1,400 route miles added per month in the second quarter.

**Conclusion:**

Given the strong performance in wireless service revenue and operational efficiency, along with the company's focus on 5G expansion and fiber deployment, the short-term impact on Verizon's stock price is likely to be positive. The company's ability to navigate headwinds from accounting standards and maintain its position in the market suggests that investors should remain optimistic about Verizon's prospects.
