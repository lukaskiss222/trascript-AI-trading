Based on the earnings call transcript, Verizon Communications Inc. reported a net loss of $0.07 per share for the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to non-operational or one-time charges. The company highlighted strong cash flow performance, with cash flow from operations totaling $9.8 billion in the quarter. Wireless data revenue grew by 23.8% year-over-year, and the company expects continued growth in this area. The company also completed the sale of the Alltel trust properties and the spin-off of the access line properties to Frontier, which will be fully reflected in the second half of the year. The company expects to provide pro forma historical information in late August or early September. Overall, the company's guidance for the second half of the year was positive, with expectations for continued growth in wireless data revenue and cost savings in the wireline business.

In terms of the short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price, the company's strong cash flow performance and positive guidance for the second half of the year should provide some support to the stock price. However, the company's net loss in the second quarter and the one-time charges related to the spin-off of the access line properties may cause some short-term volatility in the stock price. Overall, the company's outlook for the second half of the year and its focus on cost savings and growth opportunities should provide some long-term support to the stock price.
