**Analysis:**

Verizon's Q2 2011 earnings call revealed strong performance across key segments, with notable growth in wireless and enterprise businesses, driven by strategic initiatives and cost containment measures. The company's focus on expanding market share, improving margins, and increasing profitability is evident. The transition of the CEO role from Ivan to Lowell McAdam was smoothly executed, with McAdam expressing confidence in the company's future prospects. However, the call also highlighted potential challenges, including the impact of the iPhone 5 delay on smartphone market share and the need to manage churn due to the introduction of tiered pricing. Overall, the earnings call underscores Verizon's commitment to driving growth and profitability while navigating market dynamics and competitive pressures.

**Conclusion:**

Verizon's strong Q2 performance suggests a positive impact on the stock in the short term, driven by robust wireless and enterprise growth. However, the potential challenges related to smartphone market share and churn due to tiered pricing may introduce some short-term volatility. Given the overall positive outlook and strategic initiatives, I predict a **1** on the rating scale.
