**Analysis:**

Verizon's Q1 2020 earnings call revealed significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced customer activity, increased bad debt expense, and lower service revenue. The company's management highlighted the need for cost-saving measures and strategic expansions. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with a cash buffer and low unsecured bond maturities. The company's 5G network rollout and other strategic initiatives continue despite the pandemic. The company's guidance for 2020 projects a range of negative to positive 2% change in EPS, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's impact on the business.

**Conclusion:**

Verizon's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the reduced service revenue and increased bad debt expense. However, the company's strong balance sheet and strategic initiatives suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to remain volatile in the short term due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's impact on the business. The stock is likely to rally if the company's strategic initiatives and cost-saving measures prove effective in mitigating the impact of the pandemic.
