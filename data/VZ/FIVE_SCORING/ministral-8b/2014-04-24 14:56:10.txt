Based on the earnings transcript, the following points are notable for short-term stock market implications:

1. **Accretion from Wireless Transaction**: The company's earnings were affected by a one-time gain from the sale of its minority interest in Vodafone Omnitel, which is a non-cash item. This gain boosts earnings but is not indicative of ongoing performance.
2. **Wireless Churn and EDGE Pricing**: The company's wireless business saw an increase in churn, particularly among basic phone customers. The introduction of EDGE pricing and the More Everything plan may help mitigate churn but could also affect ARPA in the short term.
3. **FiOS Revenue and Churn**: FiOS revenues grew, but the company saw some churn due to competitive pressures and weather issues. The company expects to improve net adds in the second quarter.
4. **Network Performance and AWS Rollout**: The company is confident in its network performance and is continuing to roll out AWS spectrum. This should provide long-term growth but may not have immediate stock market impact.
5. **Enterprise Segment**: The enterprise segment saw revenue declines due to secular and economic challenges. The company expects this segment to remain flat in 2014.
6. **Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures**: The company reported strong cash flow and capital expenditures, which should support future growth.
7. **Dividends and Shareholder Returns**: The company is committed to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as the company has delivered strong earnings and cash flow. However, the stock market may be cautious due to the uncertainty around EDGE pricing and the potential impact on ARPA. The company's guidance for the year is also important, and any changes to this guidance could impact the stock price.
