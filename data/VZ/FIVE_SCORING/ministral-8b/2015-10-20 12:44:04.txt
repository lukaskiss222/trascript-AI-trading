### Analysis:

The Verizon Communications Inc. earnings call revealed a mixed performance with strong growth in certain areas but also highlighted challenges and potential risks. Key points include:

1. **Wireless Segment**: The wireless segment showed growth in postpaid connections and profitability, with a significant increase in postpaid net adds. However, the handset upgrade rate was lower than expected, which could impact margins in the near term.

2. **Wireline Segment**: The wireline segment saw growth in FiOS broadband and video subscribers, but there was a decline in enterprise and wholesale revenues. The company is committed to FiOS but is also preparing for the divestiture of certain properties.

3. **Cost Management and Strategic Initiatives**: The company is focused on cost-cutting and strategic initiatives, including the launch of go90 and Hum, which are expected to drive future growth. However, the launch of these products may initially put a drag on earnings.

4. **Spectrum and Network Expansion**: Verizon is actively pursuing spectrum auctions and network expansion, particularly in the 600 MHz band. The company is also exploring the use of unlicensed LTE to increase network capacity.

5. **Competitive Landscape**: The competitive landscape remains intense, with other carriers also focusing on cost management and strategic initiatives. Verizon is positioning itself to compete effectively in this environment.

### Conclusion:

Given the mixed performance and the potential risks, the stock price is likely to face short-term volatility. The positive aspects, such as growth in postpaid connections and profitability, may be offset by the challenges posed by handset upgrades and the launch of new products. Additionally, the competitive landscape and the potential impact of spectrum auctions could add to the uncertainty. Therefore, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be **negative**.

**Rating: -1**
