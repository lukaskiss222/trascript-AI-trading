Based on the transcript of Verizon Communications Inc.'s third quarter 2016 earnings call, here are the key points and their implications for the stock price over the next 1–2 weeks:

1. **Financial Performance**: Verizon reported earnings of $0.89 per share, which was below analyst expectations. The company also reported a noncash pre-tax loss of $797 million due to pension re-measurement and severance costs. Excluding these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01, down 2.9% from the previous year. This indicates that Verizon's financial performance was not as strong as expected.

2. **Wireless Segment**: The wireless segment saw a decline in service revenue and equipment revenue, which was partially offset by an increase in service revenue plus installment billings. The company also reported a decline in postpaid net additions, which was due to a net decline in 3G smartphones and an increase in tablet net additions. The company expects to return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017.

3. **Wireline Segment**: The wireline segment reported a decline in total operating revenues, which was primarily due to the sale of the three wireline markets to Frontier. The company also reported a decline in global enterprise revenue and wholesale revenue. However, the company expects to see a decline in wholesale revenue in the fourth quarter due to nonrecurring items in the prior year.

4. **Cost Structure**: The company reported a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter, which was primarily due to a decline in wireless operating revenues and wireline operating revenues. The company expects to continue to make progress in expanding the wireline EBITDA margin.

5. **Strategic Positioning**: The company reported progress in its strategic positioning and investments, including the launch of LTE Advanced in over 460 markets and the launch of a 5G commercial pilot program in 2017. The company also reported progress in its digital media and Internet of Things (IOT) initiatives.

6. **M&A Strategy**: The company reported that it is focused on integrating its recent acquisitions, including Telogis and Fleetmatics, and that it does not see any large acquisitions on the horizon.

Based on these points, the short-term (1–2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be negative. The company's financial performance was not as strong as expected, and the wireless segment reported a decline in service revenue and equipment revenue. Additionally, the company reported a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin, which may indicate that the company is not as profitable as expected. However, the company's strategic positioning and investments may provide long-term growth opportunities. Therefore, the stock price may stabilize or even rally in the long term, but the short-term impact is likely to be negative.
