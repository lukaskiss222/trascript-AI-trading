### Analysis

Verizon's Q1 2018 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported a strong performance with revenue growth and improved EBITDA margins, driven by solid wireless service revenue and a disciplined approach to capital spending. However, the impact of the revenue recognition standard and the inclusion of Yahoo in the results led to a slight decrease in EBITDA margin. The company's 5G strategy remains on track, with residential broadband and mobility deployments progressing as planned. The call also highlighted the company's focus on cost-cutting initiatives, with $200 million in savings realized so far in 2018. Despite these positive developments, the call also touched on the potential impact of cable operators entering the wireless market, which could increase competition. Overall, the call provided a balanced view of Verizon's performance and future prospects.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on Verizon's stock price is likely to be neutral. The company's strong Q1 performance and the positive outlook for 5G deployment and cost-cutting initiatives are likely to be seen as positive by investors. However, the potential impact of increased competition from cable operators and the impact of the revenue recognition standard may temper the stock's performance. Given the mixed signals, the stock is likely to trade in a range, with no significant movement expected in the next 1-2 weeks.
