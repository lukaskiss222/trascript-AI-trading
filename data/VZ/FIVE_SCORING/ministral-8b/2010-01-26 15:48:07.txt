### Analysis:

Verizon Communications Inc.'s fourth quarter 2009 earnings call highlighted mixed results. The company reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.23, but adjusted earnings before special items were $0.54 per share. The key factors influencing the financial performance include economic downturns, pension costs, and the integration of Alltel. The company also reported strong cash flow growth, driven by wireless and FiOS initiatives. However, the company faces headwinds from economic pressures, particularly in the enterprise and wholesale markets. Management expects modest organic growth in 2010, driven by wireless and FiOS, but the overall outlook remains cautious due to economic uncertainties.

### Conclusion:

Verizon's stock is likely to experience short-term volatility due to the mixed earnings results and uncertain economic conditions. The company's focus on cost-cutting and strategic initiatives, such as FiOS and wireless data growth, suggests long-term potential, but immediate market reactions may be negative. Therefore, the stock price is likely to experience a negative impact in the short term.
