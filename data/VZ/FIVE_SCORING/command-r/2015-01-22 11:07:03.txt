The earnings call reveals a confident management focusing on customer growth and network investments, especially in the Wireless segment. While intense competition is expected in 2015, Verizon scramble high-quality customers and upgrades, prioritizing profitability. The company's strong cash position enables continued network enhancements, with 2015 CapEx slightly above 2014 levels. Wireline's gradual improvement and focus on FiOS penetration offer long-term growth potential. The absence of major asset sales and the possibility of spectrumnormalization incur short-term uncertainty. The stock will likely face pressure in the coming weeks.
