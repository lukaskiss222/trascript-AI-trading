Verizon's Q1 results demonstrate resilience in its wireless segment, with strong data revenue growth and improved ARPU, despite intense competition. However, the wireline sector faces challenges, reflected in its declining revenues and margins. The company's focus on cost-cutting and efficiency measures is encouraging, but the full impact may take time. The stock is likely to experience a modest dip in the short term due to the wireline segment's performance but should recover as cost savings initiatives progress.
