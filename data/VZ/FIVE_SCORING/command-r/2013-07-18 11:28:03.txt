The MoM improvement in wireless performance, especially in smartphone activations and data usage, is notable. However, the wireline segment faces challenges, with legacy services declining. The exploration of Canadian investment opportunities adds uncertainty. The stock will likely consolidate in the short term due to mixed signals but should benefit from continued wireless growth and robust cash flows long term.
