The consistently strong performance of Verizon's Wireless segment is expected to sustain the company's overall revenue and profit growth. The upcoming 4G LTE launch is also poised to drive future revenue opportunities. Meanwhile, the Wireline segment's cost-cutting initiatives have successfully stabilized its profitability, with margin improvement anticipated in the near future. Verizon's superior network position and diverse growth strategies make the company well-equipped for long-term success. However, in the short term, the stock may experience pressure due to intense competition and the absence of significant improvement in the economy. [-1]
