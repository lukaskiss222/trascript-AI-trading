Highlights of Verizon's Q3 performance demonstrate consistent growth in strategic areas, notably Wireless services revenue and FiOS consumer revenue. The pending acquisition of Verizon Wireless maps out a profitable future. However, the mixed macro environment influences enterprise spending, impacting Wireline performance.

Overall, the stock is likely to experience a slow negative movement in the next two weeks. [-1]
