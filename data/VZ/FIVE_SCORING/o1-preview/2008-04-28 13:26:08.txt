Verizon reported strong first-quarter results with mid single-digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth, highlighting resilience amid economic uncertainty. Key growth drivers included robust Wireless performance, significant growth in FiOS subscriptions, and sustained demand in enterprise strategic services. Management's optimistic tone and strategic investments, such as the acquisition of 700 MHz spectrum and share repurchases, suggest positive momentum that is likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
