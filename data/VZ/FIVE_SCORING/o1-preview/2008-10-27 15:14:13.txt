Verizon reported strong Q3 2008 results, with significant revenue growth driven by double-digit gains in the wireless segment and robust performance of FiOS services. The company increased its dividend by 7% and expects full-year EPS growth of around 8%, reflecting confidence in its financial stability despite economic uncertainties. While management acknowledged potential challenges, the strong operational performance suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
