Verizon reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year results, driven by robust growth in its wireless segment and improved margins in wireline operations. The upcoming launch of the iPhone on its network, positive guidance for 2011, and continued cost-saving initiatives signal confidence in short-term performance. Consequently, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the near term.
