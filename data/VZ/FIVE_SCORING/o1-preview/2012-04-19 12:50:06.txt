Verizon Communications reported strong Q1 2012 results, with EPS up 15.7% and robust performance in the Wireless segment, including accelerated revenue growth, higher ARPU, and improved margins. Management's confidence in ongoing growth, effective cost management, and strong cash flow position the company favorably. Although there are challenges in the Wireline segment, the overall positive results are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
