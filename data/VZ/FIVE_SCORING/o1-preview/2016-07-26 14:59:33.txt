Verizon's Q2 2016 earnings call revealed declines in revenue and adjusted earnings, with ongoing pressures in their Wireless segment due to lower activations and increased churn. While management highlighted strategic initiatives like the Yahoo acquisition and development in 5G and IoT, these are long-term plays that may not alleviate short-term investor concerns. Therefore, the stock is likely to face negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks due to the immediate financial performance issues.
