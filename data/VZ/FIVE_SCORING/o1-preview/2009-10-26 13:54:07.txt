Verizon's earnings call highlights strong growth in the Wireless segment, with increased revenues, solid EBITDA margins, and exceptional cash flow generation. The successful integration of Alltel and progress on LTE rollout position the company well for future growth. While Wireline margins are pressured and FiOS net additions have slowed, the overall positive performance in strategic areas suggests a short-term positive impact on the stock.
