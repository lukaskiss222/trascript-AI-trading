**Analysis**: The earnings call indicated a strong quarter at Verizon, showcasing growth areas like wireless and FiOS. However, short-term concerns include increased costs in the wireless segment, particularly for handsets, which could signal a potential ramp-up to meet competition like the iPhone in the holiday season. Furthermore, there might be minor share losses in DSL affecting overall wireline performance. 

**Conclusion**: Given the anticipation of further investments in enhancing products similar to the iPhone to maintain competitiveness, minor share losses in certain segments, and the potential for higher costs, Verizon’s stock might experience a slight temporary setback in the next 1–2 weeks as investors weigh these factors against the otherwise positive revenues and earnings.

**Rating**:  [0]
