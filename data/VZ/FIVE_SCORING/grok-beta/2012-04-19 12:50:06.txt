Verizon's strong performance in Q1 2012 with accelerated service revenue growth, increased postpaid ARPU, and effective cost management indicates a positive outlook. The company remains confident in its growth strategy focusing on 4G LTE, data share plans, and other initiatives, which should buoy the stock in the near-term. However, there might be a slight moderation as investors weigh potential regulatory concerns around Spectrum transactions and continued Wireline revenue pressures.
