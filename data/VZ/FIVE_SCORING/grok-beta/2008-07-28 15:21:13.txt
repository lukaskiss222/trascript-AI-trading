Verizon Communications Inc. showcased strong financial performance in Q2 2008, with mid-single digit revenue growth, margin expansion due to wireless and FiOS, and double-digit EPS growth. The company's focus on strategic initiatives like FiOS expansion into New York City and wireless integration innovations is expected to drive future growth and manage competitive pressures, although the potential for union negotiations to impact costs could constrain stock upside in the short term. Upcoming strategic deal closures may also boost future performance.
