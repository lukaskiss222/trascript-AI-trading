Verizon's Q4 2006 earnings transcript indicates a potential positive short-term impact on stock price due to several strategic achievements and financial maneuvers. The company reported record wireless customer adds, improved consumer ARPU, significant progress on FiOS, and a successful integration of MCI with cost savings. Moreover, Verizon spun off its directory business, sold assets in the Dominican Republic, and announced plans for further asset optimization, which likely increased investor confidence in its strategic direction and capital allocation. However, there's mention of FiOS dilution and competitive pressures in some markets, suggesting a balanced outlook.
