Verizon Communications Inc.'s 2010 Q4 and full-year results highlighted significant strategic shifts and operational improvements. The company is poised for growth in key sectors: Wireless, with strong data revenue growth and LTE network expansion, and Wireline, with FiOS continuing to drive positive trends. The iPhone introduction is anticipated to accelerate this momentum, though management provided a conservative outlook due to uncertainties around supply and customer migration. Despite potential short-term EPS dilution from iPhone subsidies, the long-term outlook remains positive due to increasing Smart phone penetration, ARPU growth, and a focus on operational efficiency. The conservative guidance suggests expectations of stable to slightly positive stock movement, influenced by these strategic advancements.
