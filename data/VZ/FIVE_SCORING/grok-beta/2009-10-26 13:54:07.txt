Verizonâ€™s third quarter results exhibit a mixed but mostly positive outlook. The company maintained excellent growth in cash flows, reduced debt, increased dividends, and continued to improve its wireless and broadband offerings. Positive updates include strong wireless revenue growth, successful Alltel integration, and the anticipated launch of new high-end devices, which likely to drive data revenue growth in the near term. The planned rollout of 4G and LTE technology also suggests future revenue potential. Wireline is focusing on efficiency measures to curb ongoing margin pressures. Given these factors, the stock should see a positive short-term impact.
