Verizon reported a strong 2013 with significant growth in wireless, improved profitability, and a commitment to 4G LTE expansion. The acquisition of Vodafone's stake, despite potential short-term financing costs, is expected to be accretive to earnings and boost shareholder returns. Moreover, impressive consumer revenue growth and strategic initiatives in both the enterprise and consumer markets, along with a healthy EBITDA margin expansion, suggest positive market sentiment. However, uncertainties in enterprise spending and potential market reactions to the debt related to the acquisition might lead to some short-term volatility in stock price. Overall, the earnings call suggests a positive outlook.
