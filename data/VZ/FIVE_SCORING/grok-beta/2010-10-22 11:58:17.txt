Verizon's third quarter 2010 earnings call suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock price due to better-than-expected wireless performance and encouraging signs of stabilization in the wireline business. The company's strong cash flow performance supports further dividend increases and share buybacks, adding to investor confidence. While there are some concerns around wireline legacy services, the growth in FiOS and wireless data, along with improving overall margins, are likely to boost investor sentiment in the short term.
