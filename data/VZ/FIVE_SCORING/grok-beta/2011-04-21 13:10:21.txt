Verizon's Q1 2011 earnings call indicates strong performance in both Wireless and Wireline segments. The Wireless sector reported impressive growth with high customer additions and LTE network development, however, the positive impact on EPS are balanced by high acquisition and retention costs, which may concern investors regarding profitability. Guidance for the year suggests solid margin performance with potential fluctuations, and they are on track with their full-year revenue and EPS forecasts. Overall, the call points to a sustained, healthily growing business with, however, near-term pressures from acquisition costs.
