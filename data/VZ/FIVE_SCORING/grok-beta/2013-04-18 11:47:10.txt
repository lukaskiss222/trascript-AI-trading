Verizon's Q1 2013 earnings call showed strong performance with a notable 4.3% consumer revenue growth and operational improvements. The company's strategic investments in 4G LTE, fiber, and enterprise services, coupled with positive profitability in wireless and FiOS sectors, should positively impact its stock price in the short term. Management's optimistic tone and better-than-expected guidance also suggest positive momentum.
