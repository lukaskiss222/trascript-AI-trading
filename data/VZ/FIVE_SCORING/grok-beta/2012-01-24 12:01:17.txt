The earnings call for Verizon highlights a robust year of operational performance despite a GAAP loss due to noncash pension charges. Key points include record-breaking revenue growth, strong 4G LTE network expansion, growth in strategic enterprise services, and discipline in capital spending. These factors suggest a positive outlook for continued strong top-line growth and margin expansion in both wireless and wireline segments in the next few weeks.
