Verizon's Q2 2010 earnings call indicates a complex scenario, potentially leading to a short-term positive outlook for the stock. The company experienced significant cost reductions and strong cash flow generation, indicating efficient operations. Wireless opportunities from strategic focus on data growth, increased density and anticipation of higher data penetration with LTE, support optimism on revenue growth. Although there are temporary hurdles like wireline impacts from force reductions, the optimistic outlook for wireless, coupled with cost management, could steer the stock positively in the short term.
