Verizonâ€™s Q1 2009 earnings showed a positive trajectory with adjusted earnings per share up 3.3% both sequentially and year-over-year, solid cash flow generation, a focus on operational efficiency, and a clear strategic direction. However, there are signs of cautious economic conditions influencing parts of the business. Nonetheless, leadership and strategic initiatives are likely to instill confidence. Positive factors like continued growth in wireless service revenues and strategic investments, combined with operational discipline, support a moderate positive impact on the stock in the short term.
