Verizon's Q2 results indicated strong performance in key areas, particularly in wireless with solid growth in retail post-paid connections, steady service revenue, and improved EBITDA margins. However, a notable but not alarming increase in wireless capital expenditures and the potential for promotional pricing competition questions could slightly temper investor enthusiasm. Managementâ€™s confidence in continued sequential growth and margin performance appears supported by the data, but the focus on the high costs of 4G device upgrades and a slight reduction in strategic services growth might curb short-term stock appreciation.
