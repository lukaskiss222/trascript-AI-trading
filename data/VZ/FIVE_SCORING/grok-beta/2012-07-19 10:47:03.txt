The Q2 2012 earnings conference call revealed several positive indicators for Verizon's stock. The company's performance across both wireless and wireline segments continues to be strong, with impressive growth in wireless data revenue and effective cost management driving record EBITDA margins. Despite headwinds in the enterprise and wholesale wireline markets, Verizon is showing robust consumer demand for FiOS and expects improved wireline profitability due to strategic actions. Given these points and the double-digit EPS growth, management’s confident guidance for the year, and the stock’s focus on returning capital through dividends, the near-term (1–2 weeks) outlook for the stock remains positive.
