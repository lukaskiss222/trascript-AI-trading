Verizon's Q3 earnings report showed solid execution and a strong performance in the Wireless segment, with record-high EBITDA margins. However, the company faced challenges in the Wireline segment due to storms and a labor strike, which impacted revenue and profitability. Despite these headwinds, management remains confident in meeting full-year guidance and is focused on improving operating performance, disciplined capital spending, and efficient use of working capital. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and external factors, but the company's strong Wireless segment and improving Wireline margins should support the stock in the long term.
