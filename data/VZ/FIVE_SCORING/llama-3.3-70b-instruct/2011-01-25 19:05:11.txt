Verizon's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong financial performance, driven by solid execution and growth across all businesses. The company's Wireless segment performed exceptionally well, with record-high profitability and strong postpaid customer growth. The Wireline segment also showed improving trends, with growing revenue from FiOS and strategic services. Management expressed confidence in their ability to sustain growth and profitability, with a focus on executing their strategic plan and delivering value to customers and shareholders. 

The introduction of the iPhone and the launch of 4G LTE devices are expected to drive further growth, with management guiding for 4-8% revenue growth and 5-8% EPS accretion in 2011. The company's commitment to investing in growth platforms, managing costs, and returning value to shareholders is expected to yield positive results.

Given the strong performance and positive guidance, it is likely that the stock will experience a positive impact in the short term.
