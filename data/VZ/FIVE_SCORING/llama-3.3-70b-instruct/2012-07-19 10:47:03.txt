Verizon's Q2 earnings report showed solid top-line performance, driven by strong retail service revenues in wireless and increasing growth in consumer wireline, resulting in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. The company's wireless business continued to excel, with a record-high EBITDA service margin of 49%, while wireline margins improved sequentially despite revenue declines. Management's focus on cost management, product rationalization, and strategic investments positions the company for long-term growth and profitability.
