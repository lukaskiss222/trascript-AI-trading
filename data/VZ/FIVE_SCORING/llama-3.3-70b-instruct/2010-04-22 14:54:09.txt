Verizon's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with the company achieving solid cash flows and maintaining tight control over capital spending, while facing challenges in its wireline segment due to economic pressures and secular changes. The wireless segment performed well, driven by strong data growth, with the company adding 1.5 million net new customers and seeing a 26.4% year-over-year increase in data revenues. Management remains focused on driving further smartphone penetration and stimulating data growth, which will offset some of the voice declines. The company's guidance for 2010 remains unchanged, with capital spending expected to be in the $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion range. Overall, the company's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to its strong wireless performance and improving wireline trends.
