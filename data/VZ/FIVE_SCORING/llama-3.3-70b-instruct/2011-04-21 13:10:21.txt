Verizon's Q1 earnings call revealed a strong performance in the Wireless segment, driven by robust device sales, including the iPhone and 4G LTE devices. The company's guidance for the year remains intact, with expectations of 4-8% annual revenue growth. Management's tone was optimistic, citing the successful launch of 4G LTE devices, expansion of the FiOS customer base, and growth in strategic services. While there are concerns about the impact of the AT&T-T-Mobile merger, Verizon's spectrum position is considered strong, and the company is well-positioned to drive growth and profitability.
