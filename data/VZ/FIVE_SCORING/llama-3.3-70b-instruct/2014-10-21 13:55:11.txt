Verizon's third-quarter earnings call revealed strong revenue and profitability growth, driven by high-quality customer additions and a competitive network advantage. The company's focus on 4G device adoption, Edge program promotions, and strategic investments in networks and platforms is expected to drive future growth. Although there are headwinds in the enterprise space, Verizon's consumer and mass markets revenue continues to grow, driven by FiOS. The company's ability to monetize increasing data usage and its position in the emerging over-the-top video market are positives. 

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects.
