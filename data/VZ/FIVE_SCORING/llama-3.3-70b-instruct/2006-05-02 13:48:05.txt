Verizon's Q1 2006 earnings report showed solid financial performance, with adjusted EPS of $0.60, strong cash flows, and successful integration of MCI. The company's wireless segment demonstrated remarkable growth, with record net adds and profitability, while the wireline segment saw improvements in revenue and margin trends. Management expressed confidence in their ability to drive margin expansion and increase revenue from strategic services. Given these positive results and the company's strong position in the market, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
