Verizon's fourth-quarter 2015 earnings call presented several positive and some transitional challenges that could impact the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Verizon reported adjusted EPS of $0.89 for the fourth quarter, a 25.4% increase from the same period in 2014. Full-year adjusted EPS grew 19.1% to $3.99[1][2][3].
- **Customer Growth and Retention**: Verizon saw strong customer growth, with 1.5 million retail postpaid net additions in the quarter and a low churn rate of 0.96%[3].
- **Network Leadership**: The company continued to invest in its 4G LTE network, enhancing capacity and preparing for 5G technology, which maintains its network leadership position[3].
- **New Revenue Streams**: Growth in IoT revenues and the acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media added new revenue streams and expanded digital media capabilities[3].

### Transitional Challenges
- **Revenue Transition**: The transition from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model is pressuring service revenue, though equipment revenues are growing. The company expects this to continue until more customers adopt the new pricing model[3].
- **Plateauing Earnings**: Verizon expects 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at levels comparable to 2015, partly due to the device payment model transition and the ramping of new businesses, which may initially incur significant losses[3>.
- **Cost Cutting and Efficiency**: While Verizon has made significant cost-cutting efforts, there is ongoing work to improve efficiency, particularly in the wireline segment[3].

### Short-Term Impact
Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term. The strong financial performance, customer growth, and network investments are positives. However, the transitional challenges, such as the revenue model shift and plateauing earnings, may temper immediate stock price gains.
