Verizon's third-quarter 2019 earnings call highlighted several positive trends and strategic executions that are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Verizon reported earnings of $1.25 per share, adjusted EPS growth of 2.5%, and strong wireless service revenue growth, driven by higher postpaid phone net additions and stable prepaid revenue[5].
- **Network and 5G Progress**: The company made significant progress on its 5G deployment, expanding to 15 markets and committing to 30 markets by year-end. The launch of 5G Home and mobile edge compute initiatives also demonstrate robust strategic execution[5].
- **Customer Growth**: Verizon saw strong customer growth, particularly in the wireless segment, with postpaid phone net additions more than doubling from the previous year. This growth is attributed to new unlimited pricing plans and partnerships like the one with Disney+[5].
- **Financial Discipline**: The company maintained strong EBITDA margins, achieved cost savings through its Voluntary Separation Program, and managed its balance sheet effectively, reducing unsecured debt and maintaining a strong cash flow position[5].
- **Positive Guidance**: The guidance for the fourth quarter indicates continued momentum in wireless service revenue growth and solid cash flow performance, which should reassure investors[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong operational performance, strategic executions, and positive financial outlook.
