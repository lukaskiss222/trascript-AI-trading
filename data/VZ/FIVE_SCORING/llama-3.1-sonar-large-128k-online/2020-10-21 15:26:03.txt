Verizon's third-quarter 2020 earnings call presented several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Aspects:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Verizon reported resilient earnings with adjusted EPS of $1.25, which is flat year-over-year but includes significant headwinds from COVID-19 and accounting changes[3].
- **Network Expansion and 5G Growth**: The company made significant strides in 5G deployment, launching 5G nationwide and expanding Ultra Wideband coverage to 55 cities. This positions Verizon well for future growth and monetization of its 5G investments[3].
- **Customer Growth**: Verizon saw strong customer additions, including 142,000 postpaid phone net adds and a five-year high in Fios internet net additions of 144,000[3].
- **Guidance Update**: The company revised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance upward to 0% to 2% growth, indicating confidence in its financial performance despite ongoing challenges[3].

### Challenging Aspects:
- **Revenue Declines**: Total consolidated operating revenues were down 4.1% year-over-year, primarily due to lower wireless equipment revenue and the timing of device launches[3].
- **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic continued to impact certain revenue streams, such as travel pass and roaming revenues, although the overall COVID-19 impact decreased to $0.05 per share from $0.14 in the second quarter[3].
- **Competition and Promotions**: The company is engaged in competitive promotions, particularly around the iPhone 12 launch, which could impact short-term margins and cash flow[3].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong financial performance, positive guidance update, and significant progress in 5G and network expansion, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term. However, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures may moderate some of the gains.
