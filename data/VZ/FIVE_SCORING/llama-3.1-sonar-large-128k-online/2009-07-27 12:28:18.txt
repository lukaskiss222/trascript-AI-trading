The Verizon Communications Inc. Q2 2009 earnings transcript presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company's short-term performance. Here are the key points:

## Strong Wireless Performance
- Verizon reported significant growth in wireless revenues, with a 27.7% increase in total wireless revenues and a 9% increase in service revenues on a pro forma basis. Data revenue growth was robust, up 33.2% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for mobile broadband services[4рд╛ред

## FiOS Growth and Wireline Performance
- FiOS continued to drive consumer revenue growth, with a 60.3% increase in FiOS revenues and strong customer additions. However, the wireline segment faced cyclical economic pressures, particularly in the enterprise and wholesale markets[4].

## Cost Management and Efficiency
- The company is focused on cost reduction, having reduced headcount by over 8,000 in the last 12 months and planning further reductions in the second half of 2009. Capital spending was managed efficiently, with a 3.6% reduction in the first six months[4].

## Financial Health
- Verizon reported strong cash flow from operations, up 11.9%, and free cash flow increased by $1.8 billion year-over-year. The debt reduction plan is on track, with net debt at $64.1 billion[4].

## Competitive Positioning
- Despite competitive pressures, including the impact of new iPhone models and other smartphones, Verizon maintained low churn rates and a strong competitive position. The company is also proactive in addressing regulatory issues and industry trends, such as handset exclusivity and roaming agreements[4].

Given these points, here is the reasoning for the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Strong Wireless and FiOS Growth**: These areas continue to perform well, driving revenue and customer growth.
- **Cost Management**: Effective cost reduction strategies and efficient capital spending should help maintain profitability.
- **Financial Health**: Strong cash flow and debt reduction efforts support the company's financial stability.
- **Competitive Position**: Verizon remains competitive despite market challenges, with a strong lineup of devices and services.

### Conclusion
The overall performance and strategic positioning of Verizon suggest a positive outlook for the short term. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact.
