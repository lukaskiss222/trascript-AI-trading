Based on the transcript of Verizon Communications Inc.'s third-quarter 2006 earnings call, here are the key points that influence the short-term stock price outlook:

### Positive Indicators
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: Verizon reported a 25.8% increase in consolidated revenues, driven by growth in wireless, broadband, and enterprise data services[5].
- **Wireless Performance**: Verizon Wireless delivered outstanding results, with an 18.2% year-over-year revenue growth, high margins, and significant customer additions[5].
- **FiOS Progress**: Despite some margin compression due to FiOS expenses, the service showed strong customer growth and acceptance, with plans to expand further[5].
- **Cost Management and Synergies**: The company is on track to achieve its synergy targets from the MCI merger and is managing costs effectively, including reductions in wireline expenses[5].
- **Share Buyback and Dividend**: Verizon is proceeding with a share buyback program and plans to maintain a competitive dividend, which are generally positive for shareholders[5].

### Neutral to Negative Indicators
- **FiOS Margins**: The increased FiOS dilution and higher video and marketing costs are expected to impact wireline margins in the fourth quarter, although this is seen as a short-term issue[5].
- **Access Line Losses**: Continued losses in access lines due to competition from wireless and cable telephony may pressure wireline revenues[5].

### Overall Impact
Given the strong overall performance, particularly in wireless and broadband, along with the company's focus on cost management and shareholder value, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive.
