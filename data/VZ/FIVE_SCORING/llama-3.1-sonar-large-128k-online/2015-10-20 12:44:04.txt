The transcript for Verizon Communications Inc.'s third-quarter 2015 earnings call presents several key points that can influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Verizon reported strong earnings growth, with adjusted EPS of $1.04, a 16.9% increase from the previous year. This, combined with solid revenue growth and expanded EBITDA margins, indicates a healthy financial position[3][5].

2. **Customer Growth and Retention**: The company saw significant postpaid customer additions, improved churn rates, and strong Fios subscriber growth. These metrics suggest continued customer loyalty and satisfaction[3][5].

3. **Strategic Initiatives**: Verizon's launch of new products like go90 and Hum, along with its focus on the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile video, indicates a proactive approach to future growth and monetization of network usage[3][5].

4. **Guidance and Outlook**: The CFO, Fran Shammo, discussed the potential for earnings to plateau in 2016 due to the transition to installment plans and the divestiture of certain properties. However, this was framed as a normalization of earnings rather than a decline in performance[5].

5. **Competitive Landscape**: Verizon's focus on network quality, reliability, and simplicity, as well as its differentiation from competitors through its pricing and service models, suggests a strong competitive position[5].

Given these points, here are the key takeaways for short-term stock implications:

- **Strong current performance** and positive trends in customer growth and retention.
- **Future growth initiatives** that are well-received and show promise.
- **Cautious guidance for 2016** but framed as part of a normalizing process rather than a decline.
