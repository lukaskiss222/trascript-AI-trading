The transcript of Verizon's Q1 2020 earnings call reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **COVID-19 Impact**: The company faced significant headwinds due to COVID-19, including reduced customer activity, lower equipment sales, and increased bad debt reserves. These factors are expected to continue into the second quarter, leading to revised EPS guidance of a negative 2% to positive 2% change from the prior year[Transcript].

2. **Revenue and Service Impacts**: Verizon expects a 3% to 5% reduction in year-over-year service revenue growth in Q2 due to lower overage fees, international roaming, and other customer behavior changes. Equipment revenue is also expected to remain low due to limited in-store customer engagement[Transcript].

3. **Cost Management and Financial Strength**: Despite the challenges, Verizon has maintained strong cash flow and a solid balance sheet. The company has been proactive in managing costs and has a robust financial position to weather the crisis[Transcript].

4. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company has withdrawn its consolidated revenue guidance due to uncertainty but remains confident in its long-term strategy and business model. The focus on network investment and 5G rollout continues unabated, with no significant changes in capital expenditure plans[Transcript].

5. **Customer and Operational Adaptations**: Verizon has adapted its operations to ensure customer and employee safety, including innovative solutions like Fios in a box and virtual installations. These measures indicate a proactive approach to managing the crisis while maintaining service quality[Transcript].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Verizon's stock price is likely to be negative due to the immediate financial impacts of COVID-19, such as reduced revenue and increased bad debt reserves. However, the company's strong financial position, cost management, and continued investment in strategic areas like 5G suggest resilience and potential for long-term stability.
