The transcript for Verizon Communications Inc.'s third-quarter 2013 earnings call presents several positive and a few cautious notes that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Operating Performance**: Verizon reported double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share, with a 20.3% increase in adjusted EPS to $0.77. This strong performance is driven by robust growth in Wireless service revenue, high-quality connections growth, and the success of the Share Everything plans.
- **Wireless Segment**: The company saw significant growth in Wireless, with 1.1 million retail net additions, an 8.4% increase in service revenue, and a 51.1% EBITDA service margin. The rollout of 4G LTE and the deployment of AWS spectrum are expected to continue enhancing network quality and capacity.
- **FiOS and Enterprise**: Consumer revenue grew 4.3% driven by FiOS, and enterprise strategic services showed a 5.2% growth. The migration of Copper customers to FiOS is expected to continue, leading to increased ARPU and cost savings.
- **Financial Health**: Strong cash generation, with a 23% increase in free cash flow to $16.6 billion, and a confident outlook on de-leveraging the balance sheet post the Vodafone deal.

### Cautious Notes
- **Enterprise Challenges**: The enterprise segment, particularly the federal and state government sectors, is facing pressure due to sequestering and budget cutbacks. This could continue to impact revenue growth in the short term.
- **Market Competition**: While Verizon is gaining market share, there are competitive pressures from other carriers, especially in the prepaid segment and from cable companies in the small business market.

### Short-term Impact
Given the strong operating performance, continued growth in key segments, and the positive financial health, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term. However, the cautious notes on enterprise challenges and competitive pressures might slightly temper the enthusiasm.
