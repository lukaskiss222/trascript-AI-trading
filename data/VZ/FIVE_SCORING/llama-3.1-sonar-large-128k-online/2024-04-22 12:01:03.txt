Verizon's first-quarter 2024 earnings call highlighted several positive trends and some areas of caution, which will likely influence the stock's short-term performance.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Wireless Service Revenue Growth**: Verizon reported a 3.3% year-over-year increase in wireless service revenue, driven by pricing actions and growth in fixed wireless access (FWA)[1][4][5].
- **Solid Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA**: The company generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow and saw a 1.4% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA[1][4].
- **Broadband Growth**: Verizon added 389,000 broadband subscribers, including 203,000 FWA customers, and achieved its best quarterly result for business FWA net adds[2][4][5].
- **Operational Excellence and Cost Management**: The company is on track with its cost savings targets and is leveraging AI to enhance operational efficiencies[4].

### Areas of Caution
- **Pricing Actions and Churn**: Although the company managed churn well despite pricing actions, there could be ongoing pressure from competitive pricing and potential churn impacts[4].
- **ACP Program Impact**: The cessation of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) could lead to a small headwind in service revenue, though the impact on adjusted EBITDA is expected to be minimal[4].
- **SG&A Growth**: Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased, which could partially offset some of the gains from revenue growth[4].

### Conclusion
Given the strong performance in key metrics such as wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow, along with the company's ability to manage churn and invest in growth areas like FWA and AI, Verizon is well-positioned for the remainder of 2024. However, the slight increase in SG&A and the potential impact from the ACP program cessation might moderate the short-term upside.
