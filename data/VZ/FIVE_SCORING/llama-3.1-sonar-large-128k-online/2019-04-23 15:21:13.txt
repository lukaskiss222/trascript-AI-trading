Verizon's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted several positive and some neutral to negative factors that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Operational Performance**: Verizon reported a 1.1% increase in total consolidated revenue, driven by strong wireless service revenue growth of 4.4%. Adjusted EPS grew 2.6% year-over-year to $1.20, despite headwinds from new accounting standards[1][3].
- **5G Deployment**: The company is leading in 5G technology with successful initial launches in Chicago and Minneapolis, and plans to expand further. This innovation is expected to enhance customer experience and potentially increase ARPU[1][3].
- **Financial Strength**: Verizon maintained a strong balance sheet, reduced its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, and increased free cash flow by $700 million. The company also raised its earnings guidance for 2019[1][3].
- **Cost Savings**: The Voluntary Separation Program has yielded significant cost savings, with $118 million in the first quarter, and the company is on track to achieve $10 billion in cumulative cash savings by 2021[1][3].

### Neutral to Negative Factors:
- **Accounting Headwinds**: The adoption of new accounting standards (ASC 606 and ASC 842) created year-over-year headwinds to earnings per share, which are expected to continue through 2020[1][3].
- **Wireline Segment Challenges**: Wireline revenues decreased 3.9% due to secular pressures, pricing pressures on legacy products, and technology shifts. Although Fios Internet saw growth, Fios Video continued to decline due to cord-cutting trends[1][3].
- **Competitive Environment**: The wireless market remains competitive, with Verizon facing promotional activity and slight increases in phone churn rates[1][3].

Given these points, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is positive, driven by strong operational performance, the successful launch of 5G services, and financial discipline. However, there are some ongoing challenges in the wireline segment and from accounting changes.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the solid financial results, strong wireless service revenue growth, and the promising 5G initiatives.
