Verizon's Q4 2016 earnings call revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue and Earnings Guidance**: Verizon reported a decline in total operating revenue and service revenue, which is expected to continue into 2017, although at a slower rate. The company guides for consistent organic revenue in 2017 compared to 2016, but with an expectation that service revenue will not return to growth until 2018. This could be seen as a negative signal by investors[4%.

2. **Competitive Environment**: The company faces intense competition, particularly with the rise of unlimited plans by competitors. Verizon's decision not to follow suit with unlimited plans and its focus on premium pricing might be viewed as a risk, especially if customer migration to unsubsidized plans continues to impact service revenue[4].

3. **Cost Management and Profitability**: Despite revenue challenges, Verizon demonstrated strong cost management, which helped maintain profitability. The company expects to continue benefiting from cost-saving measures, including the new labor contracts and Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes[4].

4. **Strategic Investments**: Verizon is investing heavily in its network, including 5G trials, fiber expansion, and acquisitions like XO Communications and Yahoo. These investments are seen as positive for long-term growth but may not immediately impact short-term financials[4].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered revenue guidance, ongoing competitive challenges, and the delay in service revenue growth. However, the strong cost management and strategic investments suggest a positive long-term outlook.
