Verizon's Q3 2008 earnings call highlights several positive and stable performance indicators despite the economic uncertainty of the time. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Revenue and Customer Growth**: Verizon reported solid revenue growth, with a 5.4% increase in consolidated revenues and a 12.5% increase in wireless service revenues. The company added 1.5 million new retail customers, maintaining industry-leading margins and low churn rates[1][3][4].
- **Financial Stability**: The company showed strong cash flow generation, with $19.1 billion in cash flows from continuing operations, and a healthy balance sheet with manageable debt levels. The 7% dividend increase reflects confidence in their cash flow outlook[1][3][4].
- **Operational Performance**: FiOS continued to show strong subscriber growth, with significant increases in video and internet customers. Verizon Business saw growth in strategic services, despite competitive pricing pressures[1][3][4].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: Management expressed confidence in maintaining an 8% EPS growth for the full year 2008 and acknowledged that 2009 might see lighter consumer spending and curtailed business spending. However, they believe their business model has the underlying strength to continue performing well[1][3][4].
- **Alltel Transaction**: The Alltel acquisition is viewed as compelling despite higher financing costs and regulatory issues. The deal is expected to be accretive in the first year, although the initial estimates of accretion may be lower due to these factors[1][4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Verizon's stock price is likely to be positive due to the company's demonstrated stability, strong operational performance, and confident guidance.
