Verizon's fourth-quarter 2009 earnings call presented a mixed outlook with both positive and negative elements that could impact the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Wireless Performance**: Verizon reported strong subscriber growth, with 2.2 million net adds, and significant growth in wireless data revenues, up 26%.
- **Cash Flow and Debt Reduction**: The company had strong cash flow growth, with a 14.5% increase in cash flow from operations and a reduction in net debt by $4.4 billion.
- **FiOS Growth**: Despite some slowing, FiOS continued to show strong performance, with high ARPU and low churn rates.

### Negative Factors:
- **Net Loss and Special Items**: Verizon reported a net loss of $653 million for the quarter, largely due to special items such as severance and pension settlement costs[5].
- **Economic Pressures**: The company faced economic headwinds, particularly in the business markets, which affected revenue and margins.
- **Pension and Benefit Costs**: Significant pension and benefit costs continued to impact earnings, with an expected incremental pressure of $0.04 to $0.06 per share in 2010.

### Management's Tone and Guidance:
- **Cautious Optimism**: Management expressed cautious optimism about 2010, highlighting organic growth potential but also acknowledging economic and pension-related challenges.
- **Focus on Cost Reduction**: There is a strong focus on cost reductions and improving margins, particularly in the wireline segment.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the net loss, economic challenges, and ongoing pension costs. However, the strong cash flow, solid wireless performance, and positive outlook on FiOS and future growth initiatives suggest that the negative impact may be mitigated.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a slight negative impact in the short term due to the mixed earnings report, but the overall positive trends in key areas suggest that this impact may not be severe.
