The earnings transcript for Verizon Communications Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2011 presents several positive and some neutral to negative factors that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors:
- **Record Revenue Growth**: Verizon reported a 7.7% year-over-year revenue growth, the highest quarterly growth since the company's formation, driven by strong demand for wireless services, FiOS, and strategic business products[2][3].
- **Strong Wireless Performance**: The company had its best quarter for smartphone sales, 4G LTE device sales, and customer upgrades, with significant growth in retail postpaid connections and data revenues[2][3].
- **FiOS and Enterprise Growth**: FiOS revenue grew 18.2% in the fourth quarter, and enterprise strategic services continued to drive year-over-year improvements, with Terremark revenues up 10% sequentially[2][3].
- **Dividend Increase and Shareholder Return**: Verizon's Board of Directors approved a fifth consecutive year of dividend increases, and the total return to shareholders was 18.2% for 2011, outpacing peers and broader indices[2][3].

### Neutral to Negative Factors:
- **Non-Cash Pension Charge**: The company reported a net loss of $0.71 per share on a GAAP basis due to a significant non-cash pension and postretirement plans charge, which impacted EPS[2][3].
- **Decline in Certain Revenues**: Wireline revenue declined 1.3% for the full year, and wholesale revenues declined due to secular pressures on voice services[2][3].
- **Cost Pressures**: Although mitigated by cost efficiencies, the introduction of new devices and higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter did put pressure on margins[2][3].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong revenue growth, significant advancements in wireless and FiOS, and the company's confident outlook for 2012, the positive factors are likely to outweigh the transient negative impacts. The stock is expected to see a positive impact in the short term.
