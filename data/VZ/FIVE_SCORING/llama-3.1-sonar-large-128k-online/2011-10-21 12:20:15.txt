The transcript for Verizon Communications Inc.'s third-quarter 2011 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company's short-term performance.

### Key Points:
- **Solid Execution and Earnings**: Despite challenges from storms and a labor strike, Verizon reported solid earnings with adjusted EPS of $0.56, and they remain on track to meet their full-year earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth in adjusted EPS[4].
- **Wireless Performance**: The Wireless segment showed strong growth, with a record-high service EBITDA margin of 47.8%, increased retail postpaid ARPU, and significant 4G LTE adoption. The upcoming launch of new smartphones, including the iPhone 4S, is expected to drive further growth[4].
- **Wireline Challenges**: The Wireline segment faced significant challenges due to storms and a labor strike, leading to a decline in EBITDA margin. However, FiOS revenue and penetration continued to grow, and the company expects to recover quickly in the fourth quarter[4].
- **Cash Flow and Capital Spending**: Verizon reported strong free cash flow and disciplined capital spending, with a solid increase in free cash flow and a commitment to meet their full-year capital spending guidance of $16.5 billion[4].
- **Economic and Competitive Environment**: The company is seeing economic pressure in the small and mid-sized business segments but remains competitive, especially in the cloud services and 4G LTE markets. They are confident in their ability to outperform competitors head-to-head[4].

### Short-Term Impact on Stock Price:
Given the strong performance in Wireless, the recovery expectations in Wireline, and the overall solid financial and operational results, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact. However, the immediate effects of the storms and labor strike, as well as some economic pressures, might temper this positivity slightly.

### Conclusion:
The stock is expected to see a positive impact but not a significantly strong rally due to the mixed nature of the results and the ongoing challenges.
