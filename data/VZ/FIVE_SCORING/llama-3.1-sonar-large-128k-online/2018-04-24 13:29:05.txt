Verizon's first-quarter 2018 earnings call highlighted several positive and some neutral to mildly negative points that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Points:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Verizon reported consolidated revenue growth of 6.6% and adjusted EPS of $1.17, up from $0.95 in the same quarter of 2017. This indicates solid financial performance and a positive impact from tax reform and revenue recognition standards[1][2][3].
- **Wireless Segment Strength**: The wireless business showed strong service revenue results, with a 4.7% revenue growth and low customer churn rates. This segment continues to drive the company's overall performance[1][2][3].
- **5G Deployment Progress**: Verizon is on track with its 5G deployment, with plans to launch residential broadband services later in the year. This positions the company well for future growth in the 5G era[1][2][3].
- **Cost Savings and Efficiency**: The company has seen initial success in its cost-cutting program, realizing $200 million in savings in the first quarter, which should continue to improve operational efficiencies[1][2].

### Neutral to Mildly Negative Points:
- **Oath Performance**: The Oath business saw a sequential decline in revenue due to seasonal factors, but management expects a sequential improvement as the year progresses. This could be seen as a temporary setback rather than a long-term concern[1][2][3].
- **Competition from Cable Operators**: There is increased competition from cable operators entering the wireless market, but Verizon's management appears confident in their ability to maintain their customer base through disciplined promotional strategies[1][2].
- **Special Items and Accounting Changes**: The reported earnings included special items such as early debt redemption charges and acquisition costs, which slightly dampened the net income. However, these are one-time items and do not reflect ongoing operational performance[1][2].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong financial performance, solid wireless segment results, and progress in 5G deployment, Verizon's stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term. While there are some minor headwinds from competition and the performance of the Oath segment, these do not seem significant enough to offset the overall positive trend.
