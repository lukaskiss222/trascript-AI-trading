Verizon's third-quarter 2012 earnings call highlighted several positive and some mixed trends that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Trends
- **Strong Wireless Performance**: Verizon reported significant growth in wireless service revenues, a 50% EBITDA service margin, and strong postpaid net adds, which are indicators of robust operational performance and market leadership[6|.
- **Solid Financials**: The company saw double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share, along with a 50% increase in free cash flow compared to the previous year[6|.
- **4G LTE Expansion**: The continued expansion of the 4G LTE network, with over 35% of data traffic already on this network, suggests future operational and capital efficiency improvements[6|.
- **Pension De-risking**: The pension transaction to transfer $7.5 billion in pension obligations to Prudential is expected to reduce future cash funding requirements and improve the company's financial profile.

## Mixed Trends
- **Wireline Challenges**: While consumer revenue in Wireline showed growth, especially in FiOS, the enterprise and wholesale segments faced secular and global economic challenges, leading to some margin pressure[6|.
- **Short-term Margin Pressure**: The company anticipates some margin pressure in the fourth quarter due to seasonal factors, the impact of the iPhone launch, and ongoing cost management initiatives[6|.
- **Union Contract and Regulatory Factors**: The recently agreed-upon union contracts and regulatory relief efforts are expected to benefit the company in the long term but may not provide immediate short-term benefits.

Given these factors:

- The strong performance in the wireless segment and the overall financial health of the company are likely to support the stock price.
- However, short-term challenges in the wireline segment and some anticipated margin pressure might slightly temper the immediate positive impact.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact due to the strong wireless performance and solid financials, but with some moderation due to the short-term challenges in the wireline segment.
