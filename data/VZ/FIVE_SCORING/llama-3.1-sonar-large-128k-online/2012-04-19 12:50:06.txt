### Positive Signals:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Verizon reported double-digit earnings growth, with a 15.7% increase in EPS compared to the first quarter of 2011. The company also saw significant growth in wireless service revenues, driven by increased smartphone penetration and higher data device adoption[1][2][4].

- **Wireline Improvement**: Despite a decline in wireline revenues, Verizon saw strong growth in FiOS subscriptions and broadband connections, and has plans to introduce higher speed packages to further monetize its FiOS platform[1][2][4].

### Mixed Signals:
- **Wireline Margin Challenges**: While Verizon is confident in improving wireline margins, the first quarter saw a decline due to cost pressures and product rationalization. However, the company is taking targeted actions to improve profitability, including price increases and cost savings measures[1][2][4].
- **Enterprise Segment**: The enterprise segment faced short-term revenue pressure from Europe and a decline in certain legacy products, though strategic services continued to grow[1][2][4].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong financial performance, significant growth in key areas, and the company's confidence in executing its strategy, the overall outlook for Verizon's stock in the short term (1-2 weeks) is positive. The company's ability to generate strong cash flow, improve capital efficiency, and expand its 4G LTE network are particularly encouraging.
