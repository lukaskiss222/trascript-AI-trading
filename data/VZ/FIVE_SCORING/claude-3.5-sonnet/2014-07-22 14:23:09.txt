Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Strong financial performance with 5.7% consolidated revenue growth and 24.7% EPS growth year-over-year
2. Exceptional wireless results including 1.4 million postpaid net adds and 50.3% EBITDA service margin
3. Positive momentum in key growth areas like FiOS and machine-to-machine connectivity
4. Strong cash flow position with $6.3B in free cash flow for first half
5. Management's confident outlook for second half of 2014

While there are some minor concerns around Edge program adoption and competitive pressures, the overall tone and results were very positive and exceeded expectations in most key metrics.
