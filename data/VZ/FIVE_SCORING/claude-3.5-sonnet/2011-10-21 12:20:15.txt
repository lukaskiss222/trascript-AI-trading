Based on the earnings call transcript, I expect a positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong wireless performance with record-high 47.8% EBITDA margins and continued 4G LTE leadership
2. Management reaffirmed full-year guidance despite Q3 storm impacts
3. Strong iPhone 4S demand and positive commentary on Q4 outlook
4. Robust wireless subscriber growth and improving ARPU trends

While there were some headwinds in wireline due to storms/strike impact, these appear temporary and management expects margins to improve in Q4. The overall tone was confident and operational metrics remained solid across core businesses.
