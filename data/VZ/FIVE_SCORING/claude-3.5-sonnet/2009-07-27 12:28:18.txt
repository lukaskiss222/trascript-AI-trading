Based on the earnings call transcript, I would give this a [1] (Positive impact) rating for the following reasons:

1. Despite economic challenges, Verizon showed solid performance in key growth areas:
- Strong wireless revenue growth (27.7% YoY) with industry-leading EBITDA margins
- FiOS continues strong momentum with 60.3% revenue growth
- Healthy cash flows with free cash flow up 43%

2. Management demonstrated clear strategic focus and confidence:
- Aggressive cost reduction plans in wireline
- Strong device pipeline and 4G LTE rollout plans
- Maintained market leadership position with no major customer losses

While there were some headwinds from the economy impacting enterprise/business segments, the overall tone was positive with management showing clear plans to address challenges while continuing to invest in growth areas. The fundamentals remain strong and the company appears well-positioned for eventual economic recovery.
