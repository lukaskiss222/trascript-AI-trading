Based on the earnings call transcript, Verizon demonstrated strong performance across key metrics with particularly robust wireless results. Key positives include:

1. Accelerating wireless ARPU growth and margin expansion
2. Strong 4G LTE adoption and leadership position
3. Disciplined cost management with $2B in targeted savings
4. Healthy cash flow generation
5. Strategic spectrum portfolio optimization

The only notable concerns were some weakness in wireline margins and European enterprise business, but management expressed confidence in improvement through various initiatives.

Given the strong wireless execution, accelerating growth trends, and management's confident outlook, I expect the stock to react positively over the next 1-2 weeks.
