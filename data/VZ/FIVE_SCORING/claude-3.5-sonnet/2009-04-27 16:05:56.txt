Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price. Key positives include strong wireless revenue growth (+10.5%), solid wireless margins (46%), continued FiOS momentum, and $1.5B year-over-year increase in free cash flow. While there are some headwinds from enterprise/wholesale weakness due to the economy, the company's core wireless and consumer businesses are performing well. Management's confident tone and focus on shareholder returns, cost discipline, and successful Alltel integration should be well-received by investors.
