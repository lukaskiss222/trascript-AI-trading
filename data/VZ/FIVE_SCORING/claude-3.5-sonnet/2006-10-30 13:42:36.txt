Based on the earnings call transcript, I see several positive indicators for Verizon's near-term stock performance:

1. Strong wireless performance with industry-leading margins, revenue growth, and customer additions
2. Successful progress on strategic initiatives like FiOS deployment and MCI integration
3. Healthy enterprise business demand with increasing RFPs and contract wins
4. Value-creating corporate actions like the Idearc spin-off, international asset sales, and share buybacks

However, there are some concerns:

1. Wireline margin pressure due to access line losses and FiOS dilution higher than expected
2. Competitive pressures in traditional wireline business
3. Small/medium business segment still needs improvement

Overall, the positives appear to outweigh the negatives. Management demonstrated confidence in their strategy and ability to execute. The wireless business continues to be a strong growth driver while newer initiatives like FiOS show promise despite near-term costs. The company is also taking shareholder-friendly actions to unlock value.
