Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis for Verizon's short-term stock outlook:

Key Positives:
- Record wireless performance with lowest churn in industry and strong data revenue growth
- MCI integration ahead of plan with $50M in synergies realized in Q1
- Strong FiOS momentum with penetration rates exceeding expectations
- Continued cost discipline and margin expansion opportunities

Key Concerns:
- Wireline revenue declines of 6.8% year-over-year on pro forma basis
- Legacy MCI mass market revenues declined 22%
- Increased competition expected from AT&T/BellSouth merger
- Some ongoing integration costs and investments needed for MCI

Overall Assessment:
While there are some pressures in wireline, the company's dominant wireless business, ahead-of-plan MCI synergies, and strong FiOS traction should drive positive momentum over the next 1-2 weeks. Management's confident tone about margin expansion and cost savings opportunities adds to the bullish case.
