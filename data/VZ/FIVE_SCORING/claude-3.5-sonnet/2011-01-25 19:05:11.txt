Based on the earnings transcript, I assess Verizon's likely short-term stock impact as positive. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Strong Q4 performance with record wireless margins and improving wireline trends
2. Confident guidance for 2011 with 4-8% revenue growth and 5-8% EPS growth
3. Clear strategy around iPhone launch and 4G LTE network expansion
4. Management's track record of execution and detailed plans for cost management
5. Healthy dividend policy and balance sheet with continued deleveraging

The company appears well-positioned for growth with its network assets and new initiatives, while maintaining profitability despite iPhone subsidies. The detailed plan and measured guidance suggests management credibility.
