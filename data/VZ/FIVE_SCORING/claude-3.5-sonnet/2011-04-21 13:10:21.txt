Based on a thorough analysis of this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price for several key reasons:

1. Strong wireless performance with impressive iPhone and 4G LTE device launches, driving higher ARPU and revenue growth
2. Clear path to margin expansion through cost reduction initiatives and efficient 4G network
3. Management conveyed confidence in meeting full year guidance and improving metrics throughout 2011
4. Solid progress in strategic growth areas like FiOS and enterprise services

The company demonstrated strong execution and momentum across key business segments while effectively managing costs. Management's confident tone and specific details around growth drivers suggest continued strength in the near term.
