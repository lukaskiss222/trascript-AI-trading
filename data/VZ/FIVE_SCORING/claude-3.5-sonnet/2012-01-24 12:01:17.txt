Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q4 performance with record revenue growth of 7.7%, highest since company formation
2. Robust wireless subscriber growth and smartphone adoption
3. Clear leadership in 4G LTE network deployment covering 200M+ POPs
4. Management's confident outlook for continued margin expansion and growth in 2012
5. Solid execution on cost management initiatives

While there are some minor headwinds like wholesale revenue pressure, the overall tone and results were very positive with momentum carrying into 2012. The confident guidance and focus on profitable growth should support positive stock movement.
