Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Verizon's likely short-term (1-2 weeks) stock impact:

Key Positives:
- Strong wireless results with 8.3% service revenue growth and high margins (49.8%)
- Healthy subscriber additions (941,000 retail postpaid)
- Successful execution of Share Everything plans (36% adoption)
- Robust FiOS growth with strong subscriber additions
- Increased capital investment to support network leadership

Key Concerns:
- Enterprise segment remains challenged with revenue down 4.8%
- Increased capital expenditure guidance by $200-400M
- Some competitive pressures in wireless market
- Economic uncertainty impacting enterprise customers

Overall, the results and commentary were quite positive, particularly in their core wireless business. Management conveyed confidence in their competitive position and ability to maintain industry-leading margins while growing subscribers. The increased network investment, while raising costs slightly, demonstrates commitment to maintaining network leadership. The enterprise weakness is a concern but is a smaller part of overall business.

Given the strong execution in key growth areas and management's confident outlook, I expect a positive short-term stock reaction.
