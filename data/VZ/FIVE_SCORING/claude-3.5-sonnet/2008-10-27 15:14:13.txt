Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong wireless performance with 1.5M net adds and industry-leading 44.2% margins
2. Healthy FiOS growth with 233K new TV subscribers and improving penetration rates
3. Management reaffirming 8% EPS growth target for full year 2008
4. Continued strong cash flow generation and dividend increase of 7%

However, there are some mitigating factors:
- Economic uncertainty impact on consumer/business spending
- Wireline margin pressure taking longer to improve
- Some financing headwinds related to Alltel acquisition

Overall, the company demonstrated operational stability and strength despite macro challenges, which should be viewed favorably by investors in the near-term.
