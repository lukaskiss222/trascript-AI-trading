Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of Verizon's likely short-term stock impact:

Positive factors:
- Strong wireless performance with 2.3M net adds and improved churn rates
- Business segment showing revenue growth and exceeding synergy targets
- Consumer ARPU growing at 4% with accelerating trends
- Management confident about 2007 outlook with "at least 10%" operating income growth

Concerning factors:
- Higher than expected capital expenditure guidance for 2007
- Continued FiOS dilution expected to peak in Q1 2007
- Some competitive pressures in wireless market expected in 2H 2007

Overall, the company demonstrated solid execution across segments and provided a constructive outlook for 2007. The wireless business continues to be a key growth driver while enterprise and FiOS momentum is building. While higher capex and near-term FiOS dilution may concern some investors, the overall business trajectory and management confidence suggest the stock should react positively in the short-term.
