Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Verizon's short-term stock impact:

Positives:
- Strong wireless performance with 46% EBITDA margins
- Significant cash flow growth and debt reduction
- On track with FiOS deployment and Alltel integration
- Strong device lineup for Q4 including Droid launch
- Aggressive cost reduction initiatives in wireline segment

Negatives:
- Some pressure on wireline margins
- Lower FiOS net adds due to promotional changes
- Continued economic headwinds in enterprise/wholesale
- No significant improvement yet in business spending
- Higher pension costs likely for 2010

Overall, while there are some margin pressures and economic challenges, Verizon demonstrated solid execution, strong cash flows, and clear strategic initiatives. The wireless business remains very healthy and new device launches should drive growth. The cost cutting measures and operational improvements should help offset wireline weakness.

Given the balanced but generally positive outlook, I expect a modestly positive short-term stock reaction.
