Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess a positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong wireless performance with record-breaking customer additions (2.05M new subscribers) and industry-leading margins
2. Solid momentum in broadband/FiOS with better than expected penetration rates
3. Clear articulation of cost synergies from MCI merger ($7-8B NPV) with confident execution plan
4. Management's openness to acquiring Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless, which would be viewed positively by markets

While there are some minor headwinds like FiOS dilution and wireline pressures, the overall tone was confident and forward-looking metrics appear strong. The wireless business continues to dominate and grow impressively.
