Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with wireless margins at 50.4% and wireless revenue growth of 8.6%
2. Successful execution of strategic initiatives including Share Everything plans adoption (30% of base) and 4G LTE network expansion
3. Healthy customer growth with 677,000 new retail postpaid additions and strong smartphone growth
4. Positive free cash flow growth of 64% year over year
5. Management's confident tone about continued momentum and growth through 2013

The only minor concerns were enterprise segment weakness and wireline margin pressure, but these were outweighed by wireless strength. Management demonstrated clear strategic vision and successful execution.
