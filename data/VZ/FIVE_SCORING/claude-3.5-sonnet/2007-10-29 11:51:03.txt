Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Verizon's short-term stock outlook:

Key Positives:
- Strong wireless performance with 1.8M retail net adds and growing data revenues (up 63% YoY)
- FiOS momentum with 202K TV and 229K internet net adds 
- Consumer ARPU up 11% YoY
- Margin expansion in both wireless and wireline segments
- Increased share buyback target and raised dividend

Key Concerns:
- Some slowing in business segment growth
- High handset subsidy costs impacting wireless margins
- Continued wireline access line losses

The overall tone was confident and results exceeded expectations in most key metrics. Management highlighted strong execution across growth initiatives and improving profitability trends. The company appears well-positioned heading into Q4 with new wireless devices and continued FiOS expansion.
