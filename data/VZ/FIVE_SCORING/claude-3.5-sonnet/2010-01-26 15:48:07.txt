Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a modestly positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong wireless performance with 2.2M net adds and continued data revenue growth
2. Successful integration of Alltel with better-than-expected synergies
3. Healthy cash flow generation and commitment to dividend
4. Management's confident tone about 2010 operational improvements

However, there are some moderating factors:
- Ongoing wireline margin pressure
- Economic headwinds impacting enterprise/wholesale segments
- Slower FiOS growth than expected
- Conservative guidance for 2010

The overall tone was cautiously optimistic with solid fundamentals but acknowledging near-term challenges. Management demonstrated a clear focus on profitability and cost management while maintaining strategic investments.
