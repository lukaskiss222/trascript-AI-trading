Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include: strong Q3 customer growth (1.5M postpaid net adds, up 63.5% YoY), healthy 49.5% wireless EBITDA margins despite high device volumes, continued FiOS momentum with 162K internet and 114K video adds, and management's confidence heading into Q4 with record iPhone backlog. While there are some minor headwinds like enterprise weakness and Edge program dilution, the overall operational performance and forward outlook appear strong.
