Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, Verizon demonstrated several positive indicators:

1. Strong wireless performance with expanding data revenue growth, stable market share, and healthy margins at 46%
2. Initial signs of enterprise recovery with improving revenue trends
3. Continued FiOS momentum with solid subscriber additions
4. Major cost reduction initiatives underway in wireline business
5. Strong cash flow generation and commitment to dividend safety

However, there are some minor concerns:
- Slower postpaid wireless subscriber growth 
- Ongoing wireline margin pressure
- Continued economic challenges in enterprise segment

Given the company's strong market position, improving trends in key businesses, and management's confident outlook on margins and cash flow, I expect a modestly positive short-term stock reaction.
