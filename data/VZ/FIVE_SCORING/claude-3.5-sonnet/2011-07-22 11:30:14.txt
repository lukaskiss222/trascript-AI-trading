Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Verizon's stock price. Key positive factors include: strong wireless subscriber growth with 1.3M postpaid additions, improved wireless EBITDA margins to 45.4%, accelerating service revenue growth, and solid FiOS performance. While there are some minor concerns around wireless ARPU pressure from connected devices, management provided clear strategies to address this and demonstrated strong execution overall. The new CEO transition appears smooth and the company maintains a clear focus on profitable growth.
