Based on this earnings call transcript, I see several strong positive indicators for Verizon's stock in the short term:

1. Impressive wireless performance with record-low churn rates, strong ARPU growth driven by data services, and industry-leading retail customer additions.

2. FiOS deployment ahead of schedule with strong early penetration rates and clear path to cost reductions through GPON technology.

3. Sequential improvement in enterprise business revenue for first time post-MCI merger, with synergy savings on track.

4. Strong expense control across wireline business helping maintain margins despite competitive pressures.

5. Management's confident tone and increased share buyback program signals optimism about near-term outlook.

The main concerns are wireline access line losses and competitive pressures, but these appear to be well-managed through cost controls and FiOS momentum. The overall trajectory and management's strategic execution suggest positive stock momentum over the next 1-2 weeks.
