Verizon reported strong revenue growth, particularly in its Wireless segment driven by 4G LTE and smartphone sales, and provided optimistic guidance for 2012. Although there was a GAAP loss due to non-cash pension charges, the adjusted earnings and strategic initiatives indicate positive short-term momentum. Overall, the positive performance and management's confidence are likely to support a modest stock rally in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
