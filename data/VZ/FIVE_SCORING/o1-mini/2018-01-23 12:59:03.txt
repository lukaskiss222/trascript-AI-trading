Verizon reported solid Q4 performance with wireless revenue growth and strong guidance for 2018, bolstered by the new tax law which enhances cash flow and EPS. The management's optimistic tone on strategic investments in 5G and fiber infrastructure further supports positive sentiment. These factors are likely to drive a positive short-term impact on the stock.
