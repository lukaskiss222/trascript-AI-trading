Verizon reported solid first-quarter performance with adjusted earnings per share exceeding the previous year and maintained its full-year guidance. Management's positive tone on 5G deployment and cost-cutting initiatives, along with strong wireless revenue growth, suggest confidence in sustaining performance. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
