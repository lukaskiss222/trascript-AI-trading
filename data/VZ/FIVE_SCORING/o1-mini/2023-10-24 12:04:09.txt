Verizon reported strong third-quarter results with growth in wireless service revenue, improved EBITDA, and an increased free cash flow guidance. Management's focus on strategic expansions, cost efficiencies, and continued dividend increases reinforces investor confidence despite some YoY revenue declines. The positive financial outlook and disciplined operational approach are likely to boost the stock in the short term.
