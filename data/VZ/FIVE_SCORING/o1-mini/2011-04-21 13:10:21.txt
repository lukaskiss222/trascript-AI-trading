Verizon's strong performance in its Wireless segment, particularly with the successful deployment of its 4G LTE network and substantial customer additions, highlights robust growth and effective execution. Management's positive tone, maintained guidance, and strategic expansions in both Wireless and Wireline segments suggest confidence in continued profitability. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
