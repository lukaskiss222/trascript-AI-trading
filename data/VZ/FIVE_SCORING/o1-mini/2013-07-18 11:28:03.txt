Verizon reported strong second-quarter results with significant growth in wireless revenues and adjusted EPS exceeding last yearâ€™s figures. Management maintained a positive tone, highlighted strategic investments in 4G LTE and FiOS, and provided solid guidance for the year despite minor concerns in enterprise segments. These factors are likely to bolster short-term investor confidence and support the stock price.
