Verizon's Q3 2012 earnings call reflected strong performance and promising guidance. The company reported solid growth in adjusted EPS, driven by effective cost management and a highly successful introduction of Share Everything plans. Wireless showed strong revenue growth and record margins despite high smartphone activations, indicating robust customer retention and efficient cost handling. Wireline is pressured by secular challenges but shows promise through FiOS expansion and strategic investments. The positive outlook and strategic steps likely point to a short-term positive stock impact as investors respond to the strong operational performance and potential upside from Share Everything adoption.
