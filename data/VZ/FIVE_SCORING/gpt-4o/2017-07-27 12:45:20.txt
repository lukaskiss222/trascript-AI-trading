Verizon's Q2 2017 earnings call highlights their strategic strides in maintaining network leadership and growth in wireless customer metrics. Despite a competitive environment, Verizon posted a record low churn rate and strong net additions, driven by the launch of unlimited plans. The acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets suggests a positive momentum in scaling their media business. Although there were some short-term revenue declines, specifically in wireless service, the management expects an improving trend in the second half of the year, potentially bolstering investor sentiment in the short term.
