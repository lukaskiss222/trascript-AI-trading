Verizon's Q4 2018 earnings call indicated a strong performance in their wireless segment, which remains a primary growth driver. The company reported stable revenue performance with steady customer growth and maintained a strong cash flow position. Although the guidance for 2019 suggests flat EPS growth due to some accounting changes and tax impacts, the company maintains a positive outlook, emphasizing investments in 5G deployment and operational efficiencies. With continued emphasis on wireless revenue growth and strategic 5G leadership, Verizon's actions likely support a stable or slight positive trajectory of the stock in the short term.
