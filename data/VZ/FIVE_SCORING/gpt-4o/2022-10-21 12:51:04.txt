Verizon's Q3 2022 earnings call highlighted several positive developments, including a 10% year-over-year increase in wireless service revenue and sequential EBITDA growth of nearly 3%. The company showed progress in attracting customers to new offerings like the Welcome plan, driving increased store traffic and consumer phone gross adds. Additionally, Verizon's ongoing C-Band deployment has exceeded expectations, suggesting robust future capacity. Despite some concerns, such as elevated churn due to recent pricing actions and macroeconomic uncertainty affecting interest and pension costs, management maintains revenue momentum and cost-saving programs are positioned to support near-term financial stability. The overall tone suggests a positive impact on Verizon's stock in the short term.
