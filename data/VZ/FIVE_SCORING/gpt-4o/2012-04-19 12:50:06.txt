Verizon's Q1 2012 earnings call indicated a robust quarter, with strong wireless performance reflected in a significant increase in retail service revenue and postpaid ARPU due to higher smartphone penetration. The company also reported increased free cash flow and capital efficiency, coupled with a decrease in capital expenditures. Management remains confident in continued ARPU growth and cost-saving measures, such as the introduction of a $30 upgrade fee and further operational efficiencies. While wireline margins are under pressure, strategic pricing, bundling, and cost-cutting actions are expected to enhance future profitability. Overall, the company's aggressive expansion in 4G LTE and strategic measures imply a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
