Verizon's Q3 2017 earnings call presented a mixed short-term outlook. The company reported solid operational performance in a competitive wireless market, with sequential growth in service revenue for the first time in 12 quarters, driven by increased customer adoption of unlimited data plans. Despite these positives, the financials were hampered by costs associated with early debt redemption and acquisitions. The management's confidence in maintaining strong wireless customer retention and the ongoing fiber and 5G investments could support investor sentiment. However, the financial impact of recent natural disasters and continuing pressure from video offerings could weigh on the stock in the short term.
