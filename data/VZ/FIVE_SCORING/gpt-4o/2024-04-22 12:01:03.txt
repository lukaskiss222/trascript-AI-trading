Verizon’s Q1 2024 earnings call reflects a stable performance, with the company meeting key financial metrics and maintaining momentum from 2023. The growth in wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow are positive indicators. Management’s strategic focus on customer retention, personalized service plans, and efficiency improvements using AI suggest an optimistic outlook. However, the announcement of potential headwinds due to the elimination of ACP funding presents some uncertainty.
