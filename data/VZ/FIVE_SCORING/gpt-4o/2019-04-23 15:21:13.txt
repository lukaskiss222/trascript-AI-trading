Verizon's Q1 2019 earnings call highlights a generally positive outlook, with strong growth in wireless service revenue and robust performance in the rollout of 5G technology. Management's optimistic tone, despite some headwinds like the lease accounting affecting earnings, is reinforced by their confidence in achieving low single-digit EPS growth for the year. Additionally, strategic partnerships, like with YouTube TV, and ongoing cost management efforts suggest Verizon is well-positioned to capitalize on 5G developments, which should support the stock sentiment in the short term.
