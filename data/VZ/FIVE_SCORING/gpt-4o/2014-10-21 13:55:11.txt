Verizonâ€™s earnings call highlights a robust Q3 2014 performance with strong growth across Wireless and Wireline segments. The company reported a significant year-over-year increase in earnings per share at 15.6% and pointed out strong customer additions in their Wireless segment, including a 63.5% increase in retail postpaid net additions. The confidence in future growth is bolstered by strategic investments in 4G LTE infrastructure and emerging revenue streams from machine-to-machine services, although there are challenges such as pricing pressures in the enterprise and cable competition in small business sectors. In the short term, the positive growth metrics and strategic focus are likely to act as catalysts for a modest rally in the stock price.
