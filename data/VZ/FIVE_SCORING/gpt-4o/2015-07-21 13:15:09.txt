Verizon Communications Inc. reported a solid Q2 2015 performance, with strong financials and promising future strategies. The company demonstrated double-digit earnings growth and robust cash flows, coupled with a strategic commitment to network and platform investments. Revenue growth was noted across wireless and FiOS, while future projections highlight ventures in video and the Internet of Things, bolstered by the recent AOL acquisition aimed at enhancing digital media and advertising capabilities. Despite some pressures on service revenue due to installment plans, Verizon's healthy growth in wireless accounts and effective cost management point towards positive operational stability. This overall positive tone and strategic positioning are likely to support Verizon's stock in the short term.
