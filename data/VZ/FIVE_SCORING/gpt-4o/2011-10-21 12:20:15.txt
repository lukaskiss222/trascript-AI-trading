Verizon's Q3 2011 earnings call highlights solid execution amid challenges like storms and strikes, which slightly dampened operational metrics. Despite these setbacks, Verizon maintained robust overall performance, with strong gains in Wireless driven by 4G LTE expansion and solid financial health supported by disciplined capital spending. Increased demand for 4G LTE devices and FiOS improvements, coupled with continued earnings growth commitments, imply stability and potential positivity in stock performance. However, near-term impacts from lingering storm effects and an anticipated increase in device competition could limit upside potential.
