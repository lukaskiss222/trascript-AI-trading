Verizon's earnings call highlights a strong finish to 2010, with robust performance across all segments, particularly in wireless. The company posted a significant revenue growth driven by smartphone sales, a record service EBITDA margin, and substantial free cash flow. Managementâ€™s confident yet cautious guidance for 2011 and the introduction of the iPhone are set to further drive subscriber growth and ARPU expansion. However, the potential cost pressure from iPhone subsidies and some unknowns regarding the supply-demand balance might temper some of the optimism. Overall, the positive tone and strong performance suggest a favorable short-term outlook for Verizon's stock.
