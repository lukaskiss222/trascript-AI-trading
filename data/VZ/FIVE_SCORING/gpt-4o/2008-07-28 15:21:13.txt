Verizon's Q2 2008 earnings call reflects a strong financial performance with mid-single digit revenue growth, continued margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth. The robust performance of Verizon Wireless and the successful penetration of FiOS are notable highlights. Management's confidence in maintaining this momentum, coupled with no expected significant downturn from economic conditions, suggests potential positive market sentiment in the short term. However, some challenges like FiOS video numbers falling short of expectations due to promotions and the competitive landscape are noted. Overall, the positive outlook and solid execution point towards a likely positive short-term impact on the stock.
