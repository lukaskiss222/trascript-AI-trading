Verizon's Q2 2012 earnings call presents a strong performance, with a significant increase in free cash flow and operating margin expansion driven by the wireless segment. EPS grew by 12.3% from the previous year, reflecting solid execution and cost management. Despite some headwinds in the international markets, specifically regarding the Italian business, the overall growth in high-margin areas such as Wireless and the strategic focus on 4G LTE expansion indicate positive momentum. Investors are likely to be encouraged by these results in the short term, supporting a positive outlook for the stock in the upcoming weeks.
