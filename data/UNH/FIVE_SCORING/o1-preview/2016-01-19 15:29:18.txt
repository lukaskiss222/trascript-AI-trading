UnitedHealth Group reported strong financial results, with significant revenue and earnings growth driven by its Optum business and UnitedHealthcare membership expansion. Despite losses in ACA exchange products, the company is actively mitigating these losses and considering exiting the exchanges, which should improve profitability. The positive outlook and strong performance across core businesses suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock.
