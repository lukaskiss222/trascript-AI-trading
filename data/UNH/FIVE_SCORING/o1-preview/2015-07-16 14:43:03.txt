UnitedHealth Group reported strong second-quarter results, with revenues growing 11.3% and net earnings increasing by 15%, surpassing expectations. The company raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance, signaling confidence in continued growth, and discussed the impending closure of the Catamaran acquisition, which is expected to enhance future earnings and capabilities. The positive performance, upward guidance revision, and strategic expansions are likely to result in a significant short-term rally in the stock price.
