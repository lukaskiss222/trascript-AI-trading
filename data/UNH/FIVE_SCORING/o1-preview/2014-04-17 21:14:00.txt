UnitedHealth Group's earnings call highlighted short-term challenges, including intensified pricing competition in key markets like New York, unexpectedly high costs from new hepatitis C treatments, and pressures on the commercial medical loss ratio. While the company maintained full-year guidance, management indicated that earnings may lean toward the lower end due to these factors. These issues are likely to exert short-term pressure on the stock price.
