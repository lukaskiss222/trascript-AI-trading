UnitedHealth Group reported strong Q2 earnings with a 28.2% revenue increase and 13.3% EPS growth, surpassing expectations. Despite higher losses in ACA exchange plans, the decision to exit most exchange markets in 2017 mitigates future risks. Managementâ€™s confidence, slight upward revision of full-year EPS guidance, and robust performance in the Optum segment are likely to positively influence the stock price.
