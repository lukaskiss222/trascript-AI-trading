UnitedHealth Group reported strong Q2 results with a 10% increase in EPS and 11.5% revenue growth, and raised its 2013 earnings guidance slightly. However, management expressed caution about 2014 due to anticipated pressures from Medicare Advantage funding cuts and uncertainties from the Affordable Care Act, indicating possible margin compression and slower growth ahead. These concerns may outweigh the strong current performance, potentially putting short-term pressure on the stock.
