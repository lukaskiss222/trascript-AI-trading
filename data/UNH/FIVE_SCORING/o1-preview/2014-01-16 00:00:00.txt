UnitedHealth Group reported strong 2013 results but anticipates significant headwinds in 2014 due to ACA implementation and Medicare funding cuts, projecting flat earnings per share growth. Management acknowledged near-term pressures and uncertainties around Medicare Advantage funding, which may concern investors in the short term. This cautious outlook and potential impact on earnings suggest the stock may face negative pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
