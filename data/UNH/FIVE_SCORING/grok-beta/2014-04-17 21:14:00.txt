UnitedHealth Group's first-quarter earnings call highlights significant operational resilience in the face of new healthcare policy implementation challenges. Despite a notable reduction in EPS due to ACA-related expenses, their diversified strategy provides a buffer, offsetting pressures in certain segments like commercial and individual businesses through growth in Medicaid and Optum's various services. However, the short-term pressures from the ACA, underpricing in markets like New York, and the rapid costs of new treatments like Hepatitis C, suggest potential stock price softening in the near term.
