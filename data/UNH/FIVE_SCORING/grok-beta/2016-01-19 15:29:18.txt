UnitedHealth Group's earnings call showcased strong overall performance across both UnitedHealthcare and Optum, particularly in revenue growth and cash flow, which was better than expected. Despite challenges in the individual exchange market, the company has taken steps to mitigate risks through pricing adjustments, changes in offerings, and increased reserves for potential losses. Management remains cautiously optimistic about 2016, with commitments to strong growth, profitability, and cash flow generation, supported by service performance improvements and a growing backlog for Optum. The market should react positively in the short term due to these solid fundamentals and the mitigation of exchange risks.
