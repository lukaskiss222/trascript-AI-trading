The 2013 Q1 earnings call for UnitedHealth Group showcased strong performance across both healthcare platforms. Revenue growth was impressive at 11%, mainly driven by the growth in Optum, which saw nearly doubled earnings from operations. Despite the challenges from Medicare rate reductions and concerns about the 2014 funding levels for Medicare Advantage, the management's strategy to manage costs, expand in different markets, and emphasize operational improvements suggests resilience. However, the uncertainty around Medicare funding could introduce some short-term volatility in stock price. Overall, the positive earnings results combined with diversified business strengths should generally support the stock.
