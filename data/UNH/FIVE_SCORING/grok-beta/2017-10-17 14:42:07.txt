UnitedHealth Group's Q3 2017 earnings were strong, with revenues up 9% and adjusted earnings up 23%. The company's guidance, particularly related to the health insurance tax, indicates potential headwinds but their focus on quality, cost management, and growth in Medicare and Medicaid sectors positions them well for continued performance. The emphasis on tapping into new consumer markets and ongoing innovations suggest a cautiously optimistic future, though the immediate stock price might react to the commentary on the insurance tax.
