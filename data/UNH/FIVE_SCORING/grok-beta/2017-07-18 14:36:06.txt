The upbeat tone from the executives, strong second-quarter results with revenue and earnings growth, and the optimistic guidance for 2017 suggest a positive outlook for the next 1-2 weeks. The anticipation of continued strong performance in 2018 and beyond, cost management focus, and strategic growth plans, especially in the Optum segment, are points that may drive short-term stock price increase. However, the stock price might already reflect some of this information, balancing the impact to a positive but not overly significant level.
