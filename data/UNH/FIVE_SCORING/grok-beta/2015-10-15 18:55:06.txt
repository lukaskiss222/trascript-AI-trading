UnitedHealth Group reported solid third quarter results with a 26.6% year-over-year revenue growth to $41.5 billion, significantly driven by organic growth in both UnitedHealthcare and Optum sectors. However, while the company is investing in Medicare stars and expanding into new markets, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to higher medical costs from these initiatives, along with a more conservative guidance for 2016, although long-term growth in earnings per share is expected to accelerate.
