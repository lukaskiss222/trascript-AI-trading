UnitedHealth Group's earnings call highlights sustained growth momentum, affirming full-year adjusted earnings despite a $0.60-$0.70 per share cyberattack impact.  Management emphasizes the company's adaptability and commitment to value-based care, evidenced by continued growth in Optum and value-added Medicare Advantage initiatives.  The call suggests strong confidence in future performance but also acknowledges the ongoing effects of the cyberattack on Change Healthcare, requiring further resource allocation in the second half.
