UnitedHealth Group's Q3 2013 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth (12%) and operating cash flow (more than 2x net earnings) despite some challenges like lower Medicare Advantage funding.  Management expressed confidence in future growth opportunities across various business segments, but acknowledged headwinds in Medicare Advantage funding, which is likely to affect the companyâ€™s short-term earnings outlook.  The company's commitment to share repurchases further suggests a positive investor outlook, but the short-term implications are mixed given the tempered earnings outlook.
