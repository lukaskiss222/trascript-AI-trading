UnitedHealth Group's earnings call highlights strong performance in the third quarter of 2014, with revenue and earnings exceeding expectations.  Management affirmatively raised their earnings outlook for the year, citing positive trends across their businesses and the ACA.  The main drivers seem to be consistent execution in managing costs, strong growth in Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, and positive performance from Optum.  This suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock, as the company's strong results and forward-looking guidance are likely to positively affect investor confidence.
