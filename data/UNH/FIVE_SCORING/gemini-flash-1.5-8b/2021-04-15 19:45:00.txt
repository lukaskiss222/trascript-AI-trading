UnitedHealth's earnings call highlighted strong financial performance and increased guidance.  Management emphasized continued growth in membership, particularly in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, and strong performance from OptumInsight.  The projected COVID-19 impact is still anticipated in the second half of the year, but the company is optimistic about mitigating factors like HouseCalls and telehealth utilization.  This suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
