UnitedHealth Group's Q2 2015 earnings call highlighted continued strong performance across all segments, exceeding expectations in revenue and earnings growth, notably driven by UnitedHealthcare's momentum.  The anticipated closing of the Catamaran acquisition and subsequent integration of that company's operations into the broader business will contribute to their projected growth parameters. Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to maintain this momentum in the second half of the year and into 2016.
