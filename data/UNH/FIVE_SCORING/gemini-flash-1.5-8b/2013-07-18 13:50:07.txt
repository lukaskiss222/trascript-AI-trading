UnitedHealth Group's earnings call highlights strong performance in the first half of 2013, exceeding expectations.  Management maintains optimism about the long-term value proposition, though acknowledging near-term pressures, particularly in Medicare Advantage due to funding shortfalls.  The company's focus on cost management, product innovation, and Optum's growth trajectory position it for continued success despite the challenges, potentially creating a rally in the stock price over the next few weeks.
