UnitedHealth Group's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 and full-year 2017 performance, exceeding expectations.  Management emphasized continued momentum into 2018, driven by growth in several key areas, including Optum's backlog and UnitedHealthcare's success.  Guidance for 2018 has been adjusted primarily to reflect the impact of tax reform, and although some initial pullback in membership is expected in 1Q18, management anticipates sequential growth and continued momentum throughout 2018.
