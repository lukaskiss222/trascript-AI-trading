UnitedHealth Group's Q1 2016 earnings call highlighted strong performance across the enterprise, driven by Optum's exceptional growth and continued high customer retention.  Management indicated a cautious outlook on the individual exchange market, projecting a decline in enrollment and losses.  However, the company is focusing on growing its Medicare Advantage and Medicaid membership, which are showing substantial growth, and sees opportunity in national accounts and international markets.  This suggests a potentially positive short-term impact as the company focuses on profitable segments and demonstrates strong performance in core areas.
