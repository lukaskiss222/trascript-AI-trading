UnitedHealth Group's Q1 2014 earnings reveal significant challenges from ACA implementation, including Medicare rate cuts and non-deductible healthcare taxes.  While the company performed largely in line with expectations, these headwinds resulted in a near-$0.30 per-share reduction in net earnings.  Management anticipates continued pressure in the near term, but emphasizes long-term growth opportunities, particularly in the Medicaid and Optum segments.
