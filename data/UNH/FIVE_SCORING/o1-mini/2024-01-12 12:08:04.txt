UnitedHealth Group reported solid full-year growth with a 13% increase in adjusted EPS and maintained optimistic guidance for 2024. Despite challenges like reduced Medicare Advantage funding, managementâ€™s focus on digital investments and strategic expansions provides confidence in sustained performance. The positive tone and strong fundamentals are likely to support a modest positive impact on the stock in the short term.
