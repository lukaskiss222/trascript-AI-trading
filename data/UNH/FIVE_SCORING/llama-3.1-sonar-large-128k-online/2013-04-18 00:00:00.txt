The transcript for UnitedHealth Group's First Quarter 2013 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- Strong revenue growth of 11% to $30.3 billion, driven by both UnitedHealthcare and Optum[Transcript].
- Optum's earnings from operations nearly doubled, with significant margin expansion across all its segments[Transcript].
- UnitedHealthcare added a substantial number of new members across various markets, including commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid[Transcript].
- The company maintained a strong balance sheet and cash flows from operations, and it continues to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases[Transcript].

### Negative Factors:
- Significant headwinds in Medicare Advantage due to funding reductions, sequestration, and recalibration, which are expected to impact earnings and growth in 2014[Transcript].
- The company faces a 4% or more net reduction in Medicare Advantage rates, which is more severe than anticipated and will require benefit adjustments and network changes[Transcript].
- Sequestration is expected to burden the company by $250 million to $300 million in 2013, and its full impact may not be fully absorbed immediately[Transcript].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong performance in the first quarter and the positive trends in Optum and other business segments, but also considering the significant headwinds in Medicare Advantage and the potential impact on earnings growth in 2014, the stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties.
