Based on the transcript of the UnitedHealth Group's Q2 2013 earnings call, here are the key points that influence the short-term stock price outlook:

1. **Medicare Advantage Challenges**: The company faces significant funding pressures and underfunding in Medicare Advantage for 2014 and 2015, which will impact membership growth and margins. However, management is optimistic about the long-term prospects of the program post-2016 when funding is expected to be at parity with Fee-for-Service Medicare[5>.

2. **Diversified Growth**: Despite the challenges in Medicare Advantage, UnitedHealth Group's other segments, including commercial, international, Medicaid, and Optum, are expected to perform well. Optum, in particular, is seeing strong growth and is a key driver of the company's overall performance[5].

3. **Guidance and Earnings**: The company tightened its full-year 2013 earnings guidance but did not provide specific guidance for 2014. The focus on solid earnings growth for 2014 is clear, but there are several headwinds, including funding pressures, market migrations, and regulatory impacts, which need to be navigated[5].

4. **Capital Deployment**: The company is committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while investing in growth opportunities, particularly in Optum and international markets[5].

Given these factors:

- The immediate short-term impact might be slightly negative due to the uncertainties and challenges outlined for Medicare Advantage in 2014 and 2015.
- However, the strong performance and growth in other segments, along with the company's long-term strategic outlook and commitment to returning capital to shareholders, are positive indicators.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact due to the near-term challenges in Medicare Advantage, but the overall strong performance and growth potential in other segments should mitigate this effect.
