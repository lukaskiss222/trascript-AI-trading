Based on the transcript of UnitedHealth Group's second quarter 2016 earnings call, here are the key points that could impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Strong Performance and Growth**: UnitedHealth Group reported robust growth across both UnitedHealthcare and Optum, with revenues up 28.2% year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share growing 13.3%. This strong performance is likely to be positively received by investors[6".

2. **Exchange Market Challenges**: Despite the overall strong performance, the company faced significant losses in the ACA exchange market, which were higher than initially expected. However, the company is prudently managing these losses and has reduced its footprint in this area, which could alleviate some concerns.

3. **Optimistic Outlook**: The management expressed confidence in the company's future growth, particularly highlighting the momentum in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and Optum's various segments. This positive outlook could boost investor confidence.

4. **Capital Deployment and Dividends**: The company has a strong capital allocation strategy, including share buybacks and dividend payments, which is attractive to investors. However, there was a mention of moderating share buyback activity in the second half of the year, which might slightly impact short-term investor sentiment.

5. **Regulatory and Market Trends**: The discussion around drug price trends, Medicaid pipeline opportunities, and the integration of behavioral health services into mainstream care suggests a strong strategic position in a dynamic healthcare market. These factors are generally positive for long-term growth but may have mixed short-term impacts depending on market perception.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, highlighting strong growth, robust business performance, and a confident outlook. However, the exchange market losses and slight moderation in share buybacks might introduce some short-term volatility.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong performance and optimistic outlook, despite some minor headwinds.
