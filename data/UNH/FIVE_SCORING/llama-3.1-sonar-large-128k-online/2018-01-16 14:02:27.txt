Based on the transcript of UnitedHealth Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 earnings call, here are the key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: UnitedHealth Group reported strong financial results for 2017, with revenues exceeding $201 billion, operating cash flows of $13.6 billion, and adjusted earnings per share growing 25% to $10.07. This robust performance is likely to be positively received by investors[1].

2. **Tax Reform Benefits**: The company expects significant benefits from tax reform, including improved earnings and cash flows of $1.7 billion in 2018. However, some of these benefits will be offset by premium revenue reductions and additional investments in healthcare initiatives[1].

3. **Growth and Expansion**: The company is advancing its strategic positions through acquisitions, such as DaVita Medical Group and BenMedica, which are expected to enhance its market presence and growth potential in healthcare delivery and international markets[1].

4. **Operational Efficiency**: Optum and UnitedHealthcare both demonstrated strong operational efficiency, with improved margins and cost management. Optum's operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 7.4%, and UnitedHealthcare's operating margin strengthened 30 basis points to 5.2%[1].

5. **Market Outlook**: The company's guidance for 2018 includes adjusted net earnings per share of $12.30 to $12.60 and cash flows from operations of $15 billion to $15.5 billion, indicating continued growth and financial strength[1].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting strong financial performance, strategic growth initiatives, and beneficial impacts from tax reform. These factors are likely to support the stock price in the short term.
