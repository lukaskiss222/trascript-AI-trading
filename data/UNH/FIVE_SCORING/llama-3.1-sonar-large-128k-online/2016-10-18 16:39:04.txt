UnitedHealth Group's third-quarter 2016 earnings call highlighted several positive trends and strong performance metrics that are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.

- **Broad-Based Growth**: The company reported a 12% year-over-year increase in revenues to $46.3 billion, with adjusted earnings per share growing 23% to $2.17. This broad-based growth across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare segments is a strong indicator of the company's execution and market position[4].
- **Optimistic Outlook**: Management expressed confidence in the company's momentum heading into 2017, with expectations of continued strong performance. The increased outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share further supports this positive sentiment[4].
- **Operational Efficiency**: Improvements in operating margins, a decrease in the medical care ratio, and robust cash flows from operations all point to effective management and operational efficiency[4].
- **Strategic Expansions**: The expansion of Optum's services, including significant new business awards and international growth opportunities, adds to the company's potential for future growth[4>.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
