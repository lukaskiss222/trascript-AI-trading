The earnings call for UnitedHealth Group's third quarter of 2013 presents a mixed picture with both positive and challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: UnitedHealth Group reported a 12% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by robust performances in both UnitedHealthcare and Optum, with Optum's revenue growing 33% year-over-year[1][2][3].
- **Cash Flow and Financial Strength**: The company generated strong cash flows from operations of $3.4 billion and maintained a solid balance sheet with a debt-to-total-capital ratio under 35%[1][2][3].
- **Optimistic Outlook for Optum**: Optum's strong revenue growth and margin expansion are expected to continue, with the segment contributing significantly to the company's operating earnings[1][2][3].
- **Diversification and Expansion**: The company is expanding its services and products, including new initiatives like Optum360 and continued growth in international markets, which adds to its long-term growth potential[1][2][3].

### Challenging Factors:
- **Medicare Advantage Headwinds**: The company faces significant funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program, which could impact earnings in 2014. The management acknowledged these headwinds and the need to improve star ratings and manage costs effectively[1][2][3].
- **Operating Cost Increases**: The operating cost ratio increased due to the mix of businesses and specific costs associated with the Affordable Care Act and other regulatory changes[1][2][3].
- **Commercial Membership Outlook**: The company expects commercial membership to be down in 2014 due to factors like national account losses and the impact of private exchanges[1][2][3].

### Short-Term Impact on Stock Price:
Given the mixed signals, the stock price might experience some short-term volatility. However, the overall robust financial performance, strong cash flows, and positive outlook for Optum are likely to counterbalance the immediate negatives from Medicare Advantage funding pressures and commercial membership expectations.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to remain relatively stable or see a slight positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong financial fundamentals and growth potential, despite the acknowledged headwinds.
