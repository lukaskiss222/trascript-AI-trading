UnitedHealth Group's earnings call highlights strong first-quarter performance, driven by substantial revenue growth and improved efficiency across the enterprise, particularly in Optum. The company reported a 24% increase in total revenue and a 17% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Management expressed confidence in sustaining growth through innovative healthcare solutions and strategic market expansion, despite challenges in the exchange market which they plan to minimize exposure to by 2017. The positive guidance update and robust Optum performance are likely to result in a favorable short-term impact on the stock.
