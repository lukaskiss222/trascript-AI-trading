UnitedHealth Group's Q3 2013 earnings call indicates solid performance with a 12% revenue growth and strong cash flows, despite Medicare Advantage funding pressures. The company demonstrated resilience through diversification, continued growth in Optum services, and strategic positioning in emerging markets like private exchanges. Management expressed cautious optimism for 2014, although they highlighted ongoing challenges with headwinds like government reimbursement pressures. The reiterated guidance for modest earnings growth in 2014 suggests the stock could face some pressure in the short term due to these uncertainties.
