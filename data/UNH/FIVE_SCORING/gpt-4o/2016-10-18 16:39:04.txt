UnitedHealth Group has reported strong third-quarter results, showing consistent revenue and earnings growth across all divisions, particularly through its Optum segment. The company's upward revision of its 2016 earnings outlook and its confident tone about maintaining momentum into 2017 signal positive expectations from the management. Despite exiting the ACA individual market, the focus on strategic growth and robust operational performance across UnitedHealthcare and Optum suggests a positive sentiment. The stock is likely to experience a short-term positive impact due to these encouraging results and optimistic guidance.
