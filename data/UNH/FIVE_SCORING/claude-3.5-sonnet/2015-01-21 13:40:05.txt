Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth's stock price. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q4 2014 performance with growing momentum into 2015, exceeding expectations across multiple business segments
2. Better than expected commercial membership growth and pricing discipline
3. Strong Medicare Advantage enrollment trends and optimistic outlook
4. Optum business showing exceptional growth with operating margins expanding
5. Management expressed high confidence in 2015 guidance and strategic positioning

The company appears to be firing on all cylinders with positive trends across its major business lines and clear execution on strategic initiatives. The tone from management was notably confident and backed by strong operational metrics.
