Based on analyzing the earnings call transcript, here is my assessment of the likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

The call revealed a mixed but generally positive outlook:

Positives:
- Strong Q2 results with EPS of $1.40, up 10% YoY
- Revenue growth of 11.5% 
- Tightened and slightly raised full year 2013 guidance
- Strong performance from Optum segment
- Maintained commitment to shareholder returns via dividends/buybacks

Negatives/Concerns:
- Significant Medicare Advantage pressure in 2014-2015 with benefit cuts and market exits
- Cautious commentary around 2014 earnings growth
- Higher than expected SG&A costs
- Commercial pricing pressure

While near-term Medicare Advantage headwinds create uncertainty, the company's diversified business model, strong current execution, and slightly raised guidance should provide support to the stock price over the next couple weeks. Management struck a balanced tone and demonstrated they are actively managing through challenges.

Rating: [1] - Positive impact on stock price in 1-2 week timeframe
