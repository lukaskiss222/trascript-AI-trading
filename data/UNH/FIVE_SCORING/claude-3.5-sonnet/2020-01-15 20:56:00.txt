Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth Group's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong Q4 2019 results with adjusted EPS growth of 19% and full year growth of 17%
2. Robust Medicare Advantage enrollment expectations near the upper end of guidance
3. Solid performance across business segments with improved medical cost trends
4. Management reaffirmed 2020 guidance despite HIT repeal headwinds
5. Continued momentum in OptumHealth and OptumRx businesses

While there are some minor headwinds like commercial enrollment pressure and Medicaid implementation delays, the overall tone was confident and results exceeded expectations.
