Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth Group's stock price. Key factors include:

1. Strong Q3 results with revenues up 12% to $46.3B and adjusted EPS growth of 23% to $2.17
2. Raised full-year 2016 guidance and expressed comfort with 2017 consensus estimates, with potential upside
3. Broad-based growth across all business segments with continued momentum
4. Strong retention rates and new business wins in OptumRx and Medicare Advantage
5. Management's confident tone regarding future growth prospects and strategic positioning

The combination of better-than-expected current results, raised guidance, and positive forward outlook suggests the stock should see positive momentum over the next 1-2 weeks.
