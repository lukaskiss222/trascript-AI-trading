Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of potential short-term (1-2 weeks) stock impact:

POSITIVE FACTORS:
- Beat Q2 earnings expectations & raised full year guidance
- Strong Medicaid enrollment growth exceeding 800k members
- Optum segment showing robust growth with revenues up 28%
- Management confident about Medicare Advantage positioning for 2015
- Planning significant exchange expansion in 2015 (to ~24 states)

NEGATIVE FACTORS:
- Continued commercial membership losses (280k in Q2)
- Investment spending pressuring margins near-term ($80M in Q2)
- Below target earnings growth expected for 2015
- Cautious commentary on public exchange profitability (3-5% margins)

The overall tone was constructive, with strong execution and raised guidance demonstrating business momentum. While there are some headwinds, management expressed confidence in accelerating growth. The stock should react positively in the near-term given the beat and raise, though upside may be somewhat limited by the below-target 2015 growth outlook.
