Based on my analysis of this earnings transcript, here are the key points supporting my rating:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q1 results with 24% revenue growth to $44.5B
- Organic growth of 1.3M medical members 
- Favorable prior year reserve development of $360M
- Increased full year guidance by $0.15 to $7.75-$7.95 EPS
- Optum continues strong growth trajectory

Negative factors:
- Expected $650M exchange losses in 2016 ($125M higher than prior est.)
- Will exit most ACA exchange markets in 2017
- Some margin pressure due to one extra calendar day
- Mixed Medicare rate outlook for 2017
- Political/economic challenges in Brazil business

On balance, the positives significantly outweigh the negatives. The company demonstrated broad-based strength across its businesses, solid enrollment growth, well-controlled medical costs, and increased confidence in its full-year outlook. The exchanges issue appears well-contained. The stock should react positively to these results over the next 1-2 weeks.
