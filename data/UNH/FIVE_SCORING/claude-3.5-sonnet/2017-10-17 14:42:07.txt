Based on this detailed earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth Group's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. The company demonstrated strong performance across all business segments, raised full-year 2017 guidance, and provided an optimistic outlook for 2018 despite the health insurance tax headwind. Key positives include 9% revenue growth, 23% EPS growth, strong cash flows, Medicare Advantage growth, and robust OptumRx performance. Management's confident tone and detailed growth strategies suggest continued momentum.
