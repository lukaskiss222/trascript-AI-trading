Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth Group's stock price. Key positives include:

- Strong Q3 revenue growth of 26.6% year-over-year to $41.5B
- Solid organic growth of 10% across businesses
- Maintained full year guidance of $6.25-6.35 EPS
- Expected acceleration of earnings growth in 2016
- Strong national accounts momentum heading into 2016
- Successful integration of Catamaran acquisition proceeding well

However, there are some offsetting factors:
- Higher medical loss ratios due to exchange business and Medicare Stars investments
- No guidance raise despite beat
- Conservative outlook on exchange business profitability

The overall tone was measured but confident, with management expressing optimism about 2016 growth while maintaining appropriate caution around various headwinds. The company appears well-positioned competitively but is taking a conservative approach to guidance.
