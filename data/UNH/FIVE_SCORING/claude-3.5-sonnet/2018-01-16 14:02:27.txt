Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on UnitedHealth Group's stock price. Key reasons:

1. The company reported strong Q4/FY2017 results that exceeded prior guidance, with revenue over $201B and 25% EPS growth. Additionally, momentum appears strong heading into 2018.

2. Management provided positive updated 2018 guidance incorporating tax reform benefits, with adjusted EPS of $12.30-$12.60 and increased cash flows of $15-15.5B. They are taking a balanced approach to reinvesting tax savings into growth initiatives while returning value to stakeholders.

3. The company showed strong organic growth across multiple business segments (OptumHealth, OptumRx, Medicare Advantage) and strategic M&A activity that expands their market position.
