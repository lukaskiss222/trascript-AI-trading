Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately negative short-term impact on UnitedHealth's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While the company is executing well overall and maintained its full-year guidance range, there are several near-term headwinds that could pressure the stock:

1. Commercial medical cost ratio is trending toward the higher end of guidance due to higher than expected hepatitis C drug costs ($100M+ in Q1) and early renewal impacts.

2. Medicare Advantage continues to face significant funding pressures with 3-3.5% rate cuts expected for 2015.

3. Competitive pricing pressures in key markets like New York could impact membership.

However, these challenges are partially offset by:
- Strong Optum performance and pipeline
- Solid cash flow generation
- Maintained full-year EPS guidance range

The negative factors will likely outweigh the positives in the very near-term as investors digest the increased cost pressures.
