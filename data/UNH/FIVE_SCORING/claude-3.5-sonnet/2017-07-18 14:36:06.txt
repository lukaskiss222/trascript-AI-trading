Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth Group's stock price. Key reasons include:

1. Strong Q2 results with revenues exceeding $50B for first time, 26% YoY EPS growth, and raised full-year guidance

2. Robust growth across multiple business segments (Medicare Advantage, Optum, Commercial) with strong retention rates

3. Management's confident tone regarding 2018 outlook despite known headwinds like the return of the health insurance tax

4. Continued execution on strategic initiatives like OptumCare expansion and focus on cost management/efficiency
