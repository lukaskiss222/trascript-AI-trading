Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a modestly positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong Q3 results with 12% revenue growth and solid earnings, demonstrating continued execution
2. Optum business performing exceptionally well with 54% earnings growth and reaching margin targets 2 years early
3. Management maintained confidence in growing earnings in 2014 despite Medicare Advantage headwinds

However, there are some offsetting concerns around 2014 guidance suggesting potential flat earnings and Medicare Advantage pressure. The balanced tone and executive team's track record of managing through challenges supports a moderately optimistic short-term outlook.
