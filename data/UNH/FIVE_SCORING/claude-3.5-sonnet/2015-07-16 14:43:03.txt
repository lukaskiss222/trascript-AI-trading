Based on analyzing this earnings call transcript, I predict a positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth Group's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong Q2 results and raised 2015 guidance: The company increased full-year EPS guidance to $6.25-$6.35 and revenue guidance to $154B, driven by core business performance.

2. Imminent closing of strategic Catamaran acquisition: Management indicated the Catamaran deal will close within 2 weeks, providing immediate scale benefits in pharmacy services.

3. Robust growth metrics: 11.3% revenue growth, 15% earnings growth, and strong membership gains of 1.6M year-over-year with positive momentum continuing.

4. Portfolio strength: Management highlighted strong performance across both UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments, with Optum's backlog reaching record levels.

5. Positive commentary on 2016: Management explicitly stated they expect earnings growth to accelerate in 2016, even excluding Catamaran benefits.

The comprehensive strength across business lines, raised guidance, and clear optimism from management about near-term prospects should drive positive stock performance.
