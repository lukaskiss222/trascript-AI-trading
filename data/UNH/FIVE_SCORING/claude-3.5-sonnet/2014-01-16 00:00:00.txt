Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q4 and full year 2013 results with revenues up 10.7% to $122.5B
- Optum showing impressive growth with operating earnings up 61%
- Management expressed confidence in 2014 guidance despite ACA headwinds
- Strong Medicaid growth momentum and new contract wins

Some Concerns:
- Medicare Advantage rate pressure and funding uncertainty for 2015
- Timing issues around Medicaid fee reimbursements could impact early 2014 quarters
- Limited participation in public exchanges for 2014

Overall, while there are some near-term challenges, the company demonstrated strong execution and diversification of revenue streams. Management's confident tone and reaffirmation of guidance should provide modest support to the stock price in the very short term.
