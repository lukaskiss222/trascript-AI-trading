Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on UnitedHealth's stock price. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q1 performance with revenues up 11.5% and earnings growth of 33% to $1.46 per share
2. Raised full-year guidance and positive outlook across all business segments
3. Added 1 million new members in Q1, with growth across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial segments
4. Strong medical cost management with improved MLRs across segments
5. Strategic Catamaran acquisition positions them well in pharmacy benefits

While there are some minor headwinds like Medicare Advantage rate pressures and Catamaran integration costs, the overall tone was very positive with strong fundamentals and execution.
