Based on the earnings call transcript, I expect UnitedHealth Group to have a positive stock price impact over the next 1-2 weeks for several reasons:

1. Strong operational performance across both UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments, with Optum showing exceptional growth (42% revenue growth) and UnitedHealthcare adding 1.75M new members.

2. Very robust Medicare Advantage enrollment growth tracking ahead of expectations, with projections of 300,000+ new members in Q1 2016.

3. Conservative handling of exchange losses through reserves and guidance, removing a key overhang.

4. Record cash flows of $9.7B, up 21% year-over-year, with guidance for continued strong cash generation.

While there are some headwinds from the exchange business, the company appears to have fully reserved for potential losses and the core business momentum is very strong. Management's confident tone and reaffirmed guidance suggests underlying strength.
