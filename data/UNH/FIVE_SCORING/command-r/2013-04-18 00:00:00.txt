The earnings call reveals UnitedHealth Group's strong first-quarter performance in 2013 driven by diverse business units, particularly Optum's accelerated growth and improved margins. However, the company faces challenges due to Underfunding in the Medicare Advantage program, impacting 2014 growth prospects. While the stock may experience short-term pressure due to this and other headwinds such as sequestration, the company's overall robust performance, along with its diversified business model, positions it well for the long term.
