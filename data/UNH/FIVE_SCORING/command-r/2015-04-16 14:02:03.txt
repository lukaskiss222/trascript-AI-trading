The strong earnings report and positive growth prospects indicated in UnitedHealth Group's Q1 2015 earnings call bode well for the stock in the short term. The company's diverse range of businesses, efficient medical cost management, and focus on innovation put it in a solid position. The upcoming acquisition of Catamaran, although costly, is expected to bring further strength. The stock is likely to experience an upward trend over the next 1â€“2 weeks. [1]
