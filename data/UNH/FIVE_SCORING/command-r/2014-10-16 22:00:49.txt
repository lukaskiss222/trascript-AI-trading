The earnings call reveals UnitedHealth Group's steady performance in 2014, with third-quarter revenues surpassing expectations. While the commercial business faces challenges due to increased consumer responsibility and reform headwinds, the Medicaid business benefits from expansion, serving a larger population. Optum, the healthcare services platform, stands out with impressive growth and improved margins, driven by OptumRx and OptumInsight's strong performance. The company's diverse range of businesses and focus on cost management position it well for the future. However, the stock will likely experience short-term pressure due to the uncertain impact of healthcare reforms and conservative 2015 expectations. [-1]
