Despite strong full-year results, UnitedHealth Group's stock may face short-term pressure following its Q4 earnings call. The main concerns are continued losses in its exchange business and heightened competition in the individual market, causing management to adopt a more cautious tone. However, the company's diverse range of businesses and strong financial performance in other areas may provide some support to the stock in the longer term.
