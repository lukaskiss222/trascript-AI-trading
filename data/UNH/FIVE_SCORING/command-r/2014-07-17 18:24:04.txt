Buoyed by robust Medicaid growth and strong Optum performance, UnitedHealth Group's Q2 results surpassed expectations. While commercial risk business faces challenges, sturdy Medicare and international operations, along with expanding Optum offerings, offer counterbalance. The company's strategic investments in Optum and focus on operational efficiency are pony for long-term growth. With manageable healthcare reform headwinds and progress in stars ratings, UnitedHealth Group's prospects improve. Short-term pressures from intimate competitor knowledge and established exchange procedures remain, but expansion into two dozen exchange markets in 2015 demonstrates confidence. UnitedHealth Group's graduated approach to exchanges along with prudent financial management bodes well for the coming quarters.
