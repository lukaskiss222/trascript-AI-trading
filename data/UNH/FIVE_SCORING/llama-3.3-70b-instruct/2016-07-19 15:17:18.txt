UnitedHealth Group's strong Q2 performance, driven by the growth of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, is expected to continue, with the company well-positioned for broad-based growth in 2016 and 2017. The company's diversified portfolio, innovative products, and services are resonating with consumers and customers, and its momentum is expected to carry through the decade ahead. However, the company must remain respectful of funding dynamics in federal and state programs and medical cost trends, which could pose headwinds to growth.
