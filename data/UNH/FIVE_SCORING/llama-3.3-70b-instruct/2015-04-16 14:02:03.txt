UnitedHealth Group's Q1 2015 earnings call revealed strong financial results, with net earnings growing 33% to $1.46 per share on revenues of $35.8 billion. The company's diversified businesses, including UnitedHealthcare and Optum, contributed to the growth, with Optum's revenues increasing 14.7% to $12.8 billion. The company raised its 2015 outlook, expecting revenues of $143 billion and EPS of $6.15 to $6.30. The acquisition of Catamaran is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2016, with a projected $0.30 increase in EPS. Management's tone was positive, highlighting the company's growth momentum, strong operating performance, and continued investments in innovation and customer engagement.

Given the strong earnings report and raised guidance, I expect the stock to react positively in the short term, driven by the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.
