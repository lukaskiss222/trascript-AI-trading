UnitedHealth Group's first-quarter earnings call revealed strong revenue growth and a positive outlook for 2017 and 2018. The company's leadership expressed confidence in its ability to adapt to changes in the healthcare landscape, driven by its diversified businesses, including UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Key highlights include the company's efforts to improve customer value, expand its retail presence, and invest in digital capabilities. The leadership team also discussed the potential impact of the health insurance tax and corporate tax reform on the company's financials.

Given the positive tone and strong performance, I expect the stock to experience a great positive impact in the short term.
