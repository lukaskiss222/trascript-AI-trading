UnitedHealth Group's Q1 2016 earnings call revealed a strong performance, with revenue growth of 24% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 17% year-over-year. The company's Optum segment drove much of this growth, with a 54% increase in revenue. Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to deliver strong results in 2016 and beyond, citing its diversified business mix, improving operating efficiencies, and growing demand for its services. However, the company also acknowledged challenges in the individual exchange market and expects to scale back its participation in this market. Given the company's strong performance and positive outlook, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
