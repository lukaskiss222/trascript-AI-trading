UnitedHealth Group's Q3 earnings call revealed a strong performance across its businesses, with 26.6% year-over-year revenue growth and 14% year-to-date net earnings per share growth. The company's focus on innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction is expected to drive long-term growth. However, short-term headwinds such as delayed military contracts, reduced body armor forecasts, and uncertainties around key defense contracts may impact the stock price. The company's guidance for 2016 projects $6.25 to $6.35 per share, and management expects a further lift in the rate of earnings per share growth. Overall, the company's fundamentals and growth prospects are positive, but short-term uncertainties may lead to some stock price volatility.
