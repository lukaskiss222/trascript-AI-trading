UnitedHealth Group's first-quarter earnings report showed strong performance across its businesses, with revenue growth of 11% and net earnings of $1.16 per share. The company's diversified model, with a strong presence in both commercial and government markets, has helped it navigate the challenges of the health care industry. However, the Medicare Advantage program is facing significant funding pressure, which may impact the company's growth prospects in 2014. Despite this, the company remains optimistic about its ability to deliver value to customers and investors.
