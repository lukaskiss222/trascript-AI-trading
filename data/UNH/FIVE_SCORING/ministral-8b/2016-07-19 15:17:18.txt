UnitedHealthcare reported revenues up 13.6% to $4.5 billion in the second quarter, with 320,000 domestic consumers added. The company's cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, or about 1 times net income compared to 0.7 times net income in the year-ago period.

The company's guidance for 2016 adjusted earnings per share was narrowed to a range of $7.80 to $7.95 from the former $7.75 to $7.95 per share. The company expects the combination of cost to set up new businesses for 2017 and ongoing investments in growth areas such as MedExpress, OptumCare, and International, along with strong seasonal fourth quarter earnings performance from Optum, to produce approximately equal adjusted earnings per share results in each of the last two quarters of this year.

The company's outlook for 2017 and beyond is positive, with the expectation of broad-based growth across all businesses. The company expects to drive further growth by delivering on its commitments to improve the quality and value of the health care experience for those it serves, and to objectively measure the impact of its efforts and recalibrate and enhance its performance as it advances.

Overall, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's second quarter results and outlook are positive, with strong growth in revenues and earnings per share, and a commitment to continue to improve the quality and value of the health care experience for those it serves. The company's debt-to-total-capital ratio is declining, and the company is expected to continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) implications of this earnings transcript for UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's stock price are likely to be positive, given the strong growth in revenues and earnings per share, the narrowing of the 2016 guidance, and the positive outlook for 2017 and beyond. The company's commitment to improving the quality and value of the health care experience for those it serves, and to objectively measure the impact of its efforts and recalibrate and enhance its performance as it advances, is likely to be well-received by investors.
