**Analysis:**

UnitedHealth Group's Q2 results and full-year guidance were largely in line with expectations, with revenue and earnings growth driven by strong performance across UnitedHealthcare and Optum. The company's focus on growth in non-defense markets, cost-saving measures, and strategic expansions suggests long-term potential. However, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**

The stock is likely to experience a **1** (positive impact) in the next 1-2 weeks due to the company's strong performance and consistent growth momentum.
