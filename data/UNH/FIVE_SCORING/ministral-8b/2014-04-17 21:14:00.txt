### Analysis:

The earnings call for UnitedHealth Group provided a mixed bag of news. The company reported strong financial results, with revenue growing nearly $1.4 billion or 4.5% to $31.7 billion and net earnings at $1.10 per share, in line with expectations. However, the company also highlighted significant headwinds, including the impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which reduced per share net earnings by nearly $0.30 in the first quarter and will pressure full-year net earnings by about $1.50 per share.

The company's guidance for the year includes a range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share in earnings, but management acknowledged that the items discussed might temper expectations within that range. The ACA's impacts on 2014 Medicare funding actions will cut roughly $0.45 per share beyond that, making a grand total of about $1.50 per share.

Management also discussed the challenges in the commercial market, including the effects of early renewals and the increased cost of hepatitis C treatments. The company is working on mitigating these pressures and expects to deliver a solid start to the year, despite the challenges.

### Conclusion:

Given the mixed signals and the significant headwinds the company is facing, the short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be negative. The stock may experience downward pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
