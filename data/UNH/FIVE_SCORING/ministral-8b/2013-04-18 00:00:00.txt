### Analysis:
The earnings call for UnitedHealth Group highlights strong performance in the first quarter of 2013, with revenues growing by more than 11% to reach $30.3 billion. The company's net earnings were $1.16 per share, driven by strong earnings from Optum. The balance sheet remains strong, with $3 billion in free cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 36%. The company repurchased more than $0.5 billion in shares and paid $216 million in dividends.

However, the call also reveals significant headwinds for 2014, particularly around Medicare Advantage rates and sequestration. The Medicare Advantage rate picture for 2014 is significantly underfunded, with a net reduction of 4% against a typical industry forward medical cost trend outlook of 3% or more. This underfunding will likely lead to reduced benefits and access in certain markets and will affect the growth prospects and earnings potential for the overall Medicare Advantage offerings across all markets for 2014.

Additionally, the company is facing challenges in the commercial markets, with conversion of risk-based accounts to fee status impacting revenues. The company's commercial medical care ratio target is being lowered by 80 basis points from 82% to 81.2%.

Overall, the company's growth outlook for 2013 remains strong, with expectations of $715M-$836M in sales and $4.55-$5.05 EPS. However, the company is facing significant challenges in the Medicare Advantage market and the impact of sequestration on operating costs.

### Conclusion:
The earnings call for UnitedHealth Group reveals strong performance in the first quarter of 2013, with significant growth in people served, market share, and revenue across all businesses. However, the company is facing significant headwinds in 2014, particularly around Medicare Advantage rates and sequestration. The company's growth outlook for 2013 remains strong, but the challenges in the Medicare Advantage market and the impact of sequestration on operating costs could impact the company's ability to achieve its growth targets in 2014.
