### Analysis

The earnings call for UnitedHealth Group Incorporated revealed strong financial performance for 2015, with notable growth in both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for 2015 were $1.40, bringing the full-year 2016 adjusted EPS to $6.45. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve more than 1.7 million more people domestically, while Optum's revenues grew by 42% and its revenue backlog by more than 20%. The company's cash flows were exceptionally strong at $9.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year.

However, the call also highlighted some challenges, particularly around the individual exchanges and Medicaid. The company expects to start 2016 with a public exchange membership of around 700,000 and anticipates these numbers to steadily decline over the course of the year. The company has taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance in this area. Additionally, the company has increased its premium deficiency reserve by $65 million above its investor conference estimates, bringing the total fourth quarter charge to $340 million.

### Conclusion

While the company's financial performance in 2015 was strong, the challenges around the individual exchanges and Medicaid, as well as the increased premium deficiency reserve, could lead to short-term pressure on the stock price. However, the company's focus on innovation, diversification, and cost-saving measures suggests long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
