Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\n Here's some important introductory information. \n This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual result to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risk and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. \n Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 16, 2014, which may be accessed from the investors page of the company's website.\n [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead. \nStephen Hemsley: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Given that we provided a comprehensive review at our investor conference just over a month ago and that our 2013 fourth quarter and full year results were generally in line or ahead of that discussion, we'll keep our formal comments brief this morning and spend more time on to your questions and topics of interest. \n We see 5 takeaways from this morning's discussion. 2013 was a very strong year, as we meaningfully advance the enterprise's capabilities, our growth and growth potential, diversification profile and market momentum. There are certainly near-term 2014 pressures, particularly from ACA implementation and Medicare funding actions that will divert more than $1.50 per share in earnings from us in 2014. But we have plans and actions in place to offset these reductions and to grow revenue to a range of $128 billion to $129 billion and produce earnings in the range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share, with cash flows from operations between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion. \n In 2013, we deepened our capabilities and market relationships and successfully moved beyond significant undertakings, such as the OptumRx in-sourcing, the implementation of the large, long-term TRICARE contract and extensive ACA readiness and compliance efforts. We move into 2014 with operational readiness and performance levels stronger than ever before. \n As Medicare Advantage underfunding is hurting seniors' benefits and causing disruptions to beneficiaries, our focus will remain on advocating for fair and consistent government funding to this program that now serves some 30% of this country's Medicare beneficiaries.  In continuing to innovate, shape and improve our Medicare Advantage products and services to sustain these benefits can bring the best resources and service experience for American seniors. \n We will continue to focus on delivering earnings per share growth in 2015 with our ultimate performance, dependent in part on the results of the Medicare Advantage rate-setting processes for 2015. And finally, while we will work intensively through the near-term pressures just discussed and covered comprehensively at our investor conference, we believe even more firmly that long-term, no organization has greater ability to serve and enable a more effective, modern healthcare system and respond to a national imperative to improve the performance at health care and reduce its cost from consumer benefits and well-being to care delivery and enabling technology. \n UnitedHealth Group's long-term growth and earnings potential in this undertaking has never been more compelling than it is today. \n To briefly review 2013. Full year revenues grew nearly $12 billion or 10.7% to $122.5 billion and net earnings grew 4% to $5.50 per share. Earnings were at the top end of the range we provided more than 1 year ago despite the subsequent imposition in sequestration, which cost approximately $250 million in operating earnings or $0.15 per share in 2013. \n Cash flows from operations is $7 billion or more than 1.2x net income. Fourth quarter cash flows were $1.1 billion and we ended the year with more than $1 billion in non-regulated cash. We raised our dividend by 30% once again in 2013. It is now at a $1.12 per share annual rate. And we purchased nearly $3.2 billion of UnitedHealth Group shares in 2013.  Return in equity for the year approached 18%. \n UnitedHealthcare continued its extraordinary growth in 2013. We came to serve 4.5 million more people this past year entirely through organic growth, including more than 900,000 people in public and senior market benefit programs and nearly 400,000 people internationally.  Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has grown by a remarkable 14 million people over just the past 4 years. Our benefit businesses are distinctively diversified locally, regionally and by product and customer type. \n UnitedHealthcare earned $7.3 billion in 2013. UnitedHealthcare's operating cost were well-managed in 2013, as were medical costs, with commercial trends in the area of 5%. Hospital usage per capita was lower for the fifth consecutive year in 2013 and was lower across all our major benefit businesses.\n UnitedHealthcare's results were negatively impacted by funding pressures and government-sponsored benefits, 3 calendar quarters of sequestration in Medicare and reduced levels of overall reserve development. Despite these pressures, UnitedHealth  Care Group fourth quarter earnings 9% year-over-year to $1.8 billion.\n UnitedHealthcare ended the year more aligned than ever, with key care provider partners. We have $28 billion in annual medical spending and 8 million members served under fee for value contract, including more than 2 million people under the most progressive of these performance arrangements.\n We are intensely focused on expanding our integrated and accountable care leadership throughout 2014 and we have set an aggressive target of having more than $65 billion in value-based contracts with care providers by 2018.\n Turning to Optum, our Health Services platform. Our focus on growth, simplification, integration and building larger and deeper relationships produced record revenues and operating earnings in 2013. Revenues grew 26% to $37 billion. Every reporting segment produced double-digit percentage revenue growth. As just one example of Optum's performance, our local care delivery business in OptumHealth increased both the number of payer partners and increased the number of people it served by 6% and it expanded operating margins more than 2 percentage points in 2013. Medical cost performance and patient satisfaction levels were excellent, with the overall trend held flat and our physician groups participating in health plan contracts with quality Star ratings ranging from no less than 3.5 up to 4.5 stars.\n During the fourth quarter, Optum, QSSI was honored to be engaged and serve CMS in their efforts to enroll million of Americans to the federal and state exchanges. Great progress was made over the past 90 days and we are pleased to be a part of that effort. And we will stay involved in the senior advisory capacity as this project moves to its next phase of development. \n For the year, Optum's operating earnings of $2.3 billion grew 61%, or $875 million over 2012, and are now up 84% over our 2011 baseline year. Fourth quarter 2013 operating earnings increased 43%. Optum reached its 6% operating margin target 2 years early in 2013 and now has established a new target called 8 by '16, which means an 8% operating margin by 2016. \n As we enter 2014 with our company in a very positive position, we will continue to closely study the development of the individual public exchanges in 2014 and will be selective in our approaches for 2015. However, we expect to realize strong growth by serving several ways: as established Medicaid programs grow through the ACA expansion; as eligible Medicaid prospects were identified to the federal and state exchange market; and as the inevitable dual eligible MME initiatives begin to form in our implement.\n The recent Tennessee Medicaid award for 2015, in which we earned the highest score among 7 qualified bidders, our 2015 renewal in Hawaii and the Michigan MME award, all reflect our strong capabilities and established relationships in the rapidly growing Medicaid market.\n We have won 30 new RFPs or contract renewals in the past 4 years and we have grown organically by more than 1 million people served through our UnitedHealthcare community and state business over that period. \n Continuing on 2014. Our initial Medicare growth is within our estimate, with balanced new membership growth and large employer wins during the year, offset by our exit from plans covering 150,000 people and the loss of over 90,000 seniors in 1 state account. Our Part D and Medicare Supplement offerings continue to grow well in the marketplace.\n We continue to expect commercial group risk membership to be stable in 2014, with our commercial individual insured membership declining over the course of the year. And the number of consumers served in fee-based arrangements declining due to the loss of that large state account, as well as some migration to private exchanges for both retirees and active employees. \n Our 2014 plan includes the collection of insurance fees and related taxes from state Medicaid customers. We have strong oral commitment from our customers that these were paid and we will record these revenues as written contract amendments are finalized over the course of the year. The timing of these final commitments could affect quarterly earnings progression.\n UnitedHealthcare's earnings in the first quarter will also see year-over-year variances related to reserve development, capital gains and the effect of sequestration, which did not take effect until April 1, 2013.\n Optum continues to build out its businesses around the themes of engaging consumers, aligning and optimizing care delivery, modernizing the health systems infrastructure and using data and analytics to make the health system more informed, aligned and effective. Optum expects strong top and bottom line growth in 2014, with operating earnings in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion and $45 billion to $46 billion in revenue. This performance will put earnings growth in the area of 25% and that growth rate includes, in both years, the earnings contributions from realigning our IT and global services businesses into Optum in 2014. This natural alignment will help us create and capture growth opportunities in business process outsourcing for health care and in healthcare IT assignments similar to our efforts in service to CMS.\n Optum's earnings are expected to be strong in the second half of 2014, due to growth investments early in the year, such as fully implementing Optum360, as well as more traditional seasonal earnings pattern.\n In the fourth quarter of this past year, both S&P and Moody's confirmed our corporate debt rating and upgraded their outlook. We ended the year with more than $1 billion in available cash and a ratio of debt to total capital below 35%. We continue to project cash flows from operations in a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion in 2014 and expect to return well more than $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend. \n Standing back from the numbers, UnitedHealth Group is in a very strong position. We have posted consistent growth for several years, as measured by people served, revenues, contract backlog, cash flows, operating earnings, dollars under value-based contract and so on. We have leading positions in our market, but our market share is much lower than leaders typically have in more mature industries. We serve large and growing markets, so we have considerable organic growth opportunities for the future. \n Our scale benefits the consumers, clients and customers we serve through innovation, cost advantages, efficient service and so on and this naturally engenders further growth. That model is expanding in care provider services and care delivery, with government agencies and national employers and with consumers and in Brazil, in Europe and beyond. Very large and sophisticated customers are seeking an enterprise-level partner, one with proven capabilities and the financial strength to help them navigate the changes that both consumers and government regulations are driving throughout the market, a partner like UnitedHealth Group. \n In closing, I would simply once more shorthand each takeaways. 2013 was a very strong year in growth, achievement and capabilities and putting some big operational tasks behind us. 2014 will feel the impact of the ACA taxes and Medicare funding pressures, but we believe we can produce revenue growth and earnings in the $5.40 to $5.60 per share range. We suggest the quarterly earnings progressions need to better accommodate the first quarter and first half factors we discussed this morning. \n And finally, in the longer term, we believe our prospects to grow and produce positive change across the health system for the benefit of all the system participants and our shareholders remain exceptional. \n So thank you for your time this morning and we now would like to address your questions, discuss areas of interest to you today. So can we ask the moderator to take over and we'll respond to questions. Again, 1 per analyst, please, out of respect for the others in line. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sarah James with Wedbush. \nSarah James: You touched on Medicare headwinds for '15 in the prepared remarks and I wanted to better understand if that's a headwind compared to '14, so an incremental headwind in '15? \nStephen Hemsley: I don't think we were really suggesting anything other than we had said at the investor conference, that, obviously, there were rate actions taken related to 2014 that we believe significantly underfunded the program. And we had indicated there that we are -- continue to be watchful about the funding posture on the Medicare Advantage program. And we will continue to be watchful of that and continue to advocate strongly for consistence, reasoned funding of these program and continued commitment to American seniors who participate in them. I think we didn't really mean anything more than that. \nSarah James: As I think about items to watch, there was that update in December of the 200-basis-point change in fee-for-service cost trend assumptions, so that kind of got us to a starting point of down 6% to 7%. And I think about some offsets to that. United has been very successful in medical cost savings through ACOs and risk-sharing contact with providers. So could you quantify what kind of trend vendor these efforts could create across the entire Medicare book? \nStephen Hemsley: I don't think we can. At kind of that distance, we think these programs are extremely effective and they're effective in terms of their cumulative effect. And we are intensely engaged on them across, basically, all of our benefit businesses, but certainly as they relate to government programs. In terms of the discussions that were held in December, we are not going to speculate, really, on what ultimate funding may come forward or change our position on that. We are going to be intensely engaged as that process goes forward. And as I've said before, we're going to continue to advocate strongly for strong and responsible funding to these programs. And I think we really can't speculate on a process that is really just not even really formally begun. \nOperator: We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company. \nChristine Arnold: Steve, you highlighted some seasonality issues, both in Optum, investing in Optum360 and then some seasonality issues there, as well as some timing issues potentially with the health insurance fee. Could you help us think about some of these timing issues within both Optum and UnitedHealthcare and how they might impact progression of earnings relative to what we've seen historically? I know you talked about first quarter, those 3 factors. But any help you could give us would be appreciated. \nStephen Hemsley: Yes, I think -- well, I think the general theme is to be -- I'm going to hand these off because they do really touch different parts of our business. And I'll probably ask John Rex to speak to some of the front end on Optum and then in terms of the Medicaid activities, Steve and Dan. But I think the -- we're obviously suggesting that you relook at the progressions in terms of, again, I'll say the first half versus the second half of the year, given the timing of when these Medicaid contracts will actually fall in informal terms and the patterns of the Optum business, both in its new business and its traditional seasonality. But John, you want to start up? \nJohn Rex: Yes. So when I think about Optum in 2014, so we'd expect a pattern, first half, second half pattern of roughly 40%, 60% in terms of earnings progression for the year. Now if you think about 2013, we're roughly 40%, 45% in the first half. So the impact there, you're seeing some of the impact of the investments we're making in these larger, more comprehensive relationship that we've talked about and that would be an impact that you'd see, particularly as you look across the Insight and the OptumHealth businesses. \nStephen Hemsley: Things like Optum360. \nJohn Rex: And Optum360, in particular. The one that we talk about most. \nStephen Hemsley: And then, Steve, you want to talk about Medicaid? \nSteve Nelson: Christine, it's Steve Nelson. We have -- as you've heard me say before, we have a year-round process we're engaging based on rates and we call this rate advocacy and especially from the competency of our business. But the fees and tax impact has been a part of that. We consider a part of our cost. As we sit here today, the states have over -- or I'd say, overwhelming majority of our states have agreed to reimburse us for both the fee and the tax impact. Actually, those fees have technically said no to us. We are continuing to be engaged with them in a productive and, I think, thoughtful discussion. So it's more work to do, but the progress is really significant and our outlook is positive. In terms of how we recognize the revenue, Dan, do you want to comment on that? \nDaniel Schumacher: Sure. Christine, on the revenue recognition side, as Steve mentioned, the overwhelming majority, we've got commitments. With respect to revenue recognition, we'll be relying on written commitments. We have a very good share in hand today, but still have some more to get and will make progress over the course of the first quarter and throughout the year and that will influence the timing of the revenue recognition. \nChristine Arnold: Can you elaborate on what portion, maybe you're not comfortable but if you are, what portion you have written commitments on the health insurance fee to get all of it recovered? And are they filling in efficiency adjustments below the line by telling you that you're getting the health insurance fee, but then saying you're going to get all these new memberships so maybe we don't need to you as much? Or are they recognizing the pent-up demand? \nDaniel Schumacher: You fit a couple in there. With respect to the insurance fee specifically, the majority of our states are looking to do a lump sum true-up once the fee is actually known. So we'd expect to get it in the September timeframe from a reimbursement standpoint. And in terms of how many we have in hand from a written commitment, we have less than half but more than 1/3. So we're making strong progress and we've got -- we expect in the next week and the coming weeks to be more of that, as well as for the second quarter. Your other question around pent-up demand, that was more, I think, aimed at the expansion population in the newest health members into those markets. We do have an expectation of higher views related to those new members and we have, in the vast majority of our states, a separate rate sell that does account for and reflect a higher initial use pattern. We'd expect that, obviously, to moderate over time as our clinical programs take hold. \nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with JP Morgan. \nJustin Lake: I just wanted to follow up on Medicare Advantage. It sounded like you said you're seeing membership on track versus your expectations. Wondering if we can get a little bit more color here in terms of what you're seeing in open enrollments, specifically maybe talking through some of the impact from changes to your physician network and on member attrition. Because of this, maybe are you seeing any selection issues happening here in terms of bigger members leading more significantly than others, et cetera? \nStephen Hemsley: I'll have Jack respond to this. And I'm sure he will hit this point, too. But we would remind you that we start out the year 250,000 or so down, given the market exits we took and the single contract that we lost. So Jack, do you want to pick up on that? \nJack Larsen: Sure, Justin. Jack Larsen. Maybe before I tackle the multipart question here on the 2014, let me go back and remind you about 2013 and the very strong growth year we had there, almost 1 million members, with something around 425,000 in Medicare Advantage alone. With respect to the 2014 AEP performance, let me take the growth part first. I'd say we were on our plan in all of our major product lines, Med Stop, Part D, MMA. I think for individual Medicare Advantage, we took a little bit of a different approach this year and really aimed at preserving and, in fact, growing our share in markets that we would consider to be long-term, financially stable, viable markets for us. And in these particular markets, we have really strong growth and we have retention, member retention, that was actually improved over what we had seen in prior years. And I would say in some other markets, we made a decision that we were going to seed some share to others. And in those markets, where we pay some benefit decisions, we saw retention slightly less than historical levels, as well as the rate of production and new business. And I think, as Steve referred to, you hit it right out. We started with about 150,000 people affected by market withdrawals. Now on the group side, we, I think, chatted at the investor conference about the loss of a large state-based  contract of about 90,000 people, effective 1/1. And you're seeing those numbers in the recently posted CMS result. That will be offset effective February 1 through the win of a large state account in, roughly, the 90,000 member range. So all-in, I'd say, we're right where we thought we would be this AEP and feel pretty good about our plus or minus 50,000 member growth that we shared with you at the investor conference. In terms of mix, it's just way too early. I don't think we're seeing anything that surprises us. But we're doing that analysis now. We need to see a little more information on our inbound members from CMS. And I think we'll have a better point of view the next time we speak in the [indiscernible]. \nJustin Lake: Jack, maybe just in terms of any comments on the impact due to enrollment of some of these physician -- from the physician network changes? And maybe talk a little about what benefit that's going to give you in terms of quality improvements and cost going into 2015? And then, just lastly, on those markets that you did decide to take a step back on, would it be fair to say -- should we think that the market should be concerned that you put -- that the members that are being put back into the market or that you're exiting are significantly different in terms of morbidity or risk versus those in the existing book and then maybe there could be some selection issues in the market broader? \nJack Larsen: Yes. So as I said earlier, we did see levels of attrition a little higher in those markets that we chose to seed some shares. Some of those markets are aware we are taking our network optimization, network restructuring kind of work. And it's also -- it's geography, but it's also products as well. So we differentiated between HMO products and PPO products. I think in terms of just what we are trying to accomplish in our network activities, there's just a ton of pressure all over the system. Steve referred to it and we talked about it at the investor conference. And I think that rate pricing pressures probably most defeat Medicare. The system's fragmented. Clearly, it has rising cost. And I think everyone agrees it's got the opportunity for demonstrably better outcomes. I think what we're -- the themes we see and really what the Affordable Care Act is telling us is law and CMS is suggesting us through regulations, is that the industry has to change and we have to change. We have to be more integrated. We need to be more aligned. We need to have a provider network that is aligned with us better, both in terms of data and financially. And we need to do all of that with far less resources. And I think these are the themes that we're responding to. This is what you are seeing us and others do in the marketplace with respect to reaching out and making affirmative changes in our network. So we're really evolving to meet the requirements of a Medicare program that's going to be successful in the future. So while it's going to be a little noisy and a little turbulent, we acknowledge that. I think we're conforming our business in the right way to be successful in the Medicare program in the future. \nStephen Hemsley: Gail, do you want to comment? \nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Justin, it's Gail Boudreaux. In addition to what Jack just said about network, I think it's important to think about that this activity across network is going on across all the benefits space. And Jack referenced some of just the incredible pressure in the system around rising costs, connectivity and, quite frankly, getting better outcome. But in addition to just the shaping of the network to meet the unique populations in Medicare, we're also very focused, as you know, on increasing our pay-for-performance across Medicare. We talked about that a little bit at our investor conference, moving that up dramatically over the next few years. Greater clinical integration. And it's all to drive better outcomes. And again, those who respond to CMS' desire to have greater primary care centric networks and better outcome, that's happening across all of the benefits businesses and it's really important about -- as we think about modernizing the health care system. So what we're trying to do there, I think, is evident in Medicare, but it's also evident in our other business. And our support is provide better data and allow these physicians to better and more effectively manage these patients. \nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS. \nAlbert Rice: I think I just might switch gears and ask you about the Optum and the experience with QSSI. Obviously, in the last 2 months, you guys have gotten a lot of kudos for how that's worked out. Can you comment on maybe your thoughts on the business implications of the way that's played out? Has that opened up other contracting opportunities with the federal government, outside the federal government and beyond? And give us some flavor for that, if you would. \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Obviously, I think as you're suggesting, that it's had a very positive reputational effect. But Larry, if you're on the line, do you want to start this and then maybe Andy Slavitt comment as well? \nLarry Renfro: Sure. A.J., I think you probably know this, so let me give you a little history here. When we started the project prior to October 26 -- and I'll just use that date -- we were a contractor that built the data services hub, as well as the registration process, something called the IDN.  And then we controlled all the testing. When we got brought in on October 26 to work on fixing the site, we got, obviously, to work with CMS and HHS. And they did a great job of kind of outlining everything to us so that we kind of understood where we were at. And that's why we became the general contractor. And coming to general contractor, we were operating under, what I would call an urgent timeframe for about 60 days to get things accomplished. And then we were able to get through that, learn a lot and it's now in, what I'll call a more normalized environment. And we -- we have just become, as I'm sure you read, a senior adviser. And I'll have Andy talk about that in a second. But what I would say is we obviously learned a lot in terms of working with the federal government and being a part of the whole process. I would tell you that we are also working with a lot of the state. And I think that when we were at our investor conference, we talked about we were moving over on the UHG IT side, what we do with our technology infrastructure and so forth. So we believe that's going to tie in nicely to what we did for the government to be able to offer candidly around the industry. So it's going to expand what we do. So we appreciate what we were able to accomplish and what we've learned, but we believe we're just kind of starting. Andy, you got anything else? \nAndrew Slavitt: Yes, just had a couple of quick thoughts. First of all, this is -- some of this is repetitive of what Steve and Larry covered. Clearly, this was a job done principally by CMS with the help of a lot of contractors. We were glad to be and continue to be glad to be involved. I think in terms of implications, I'll just point the 3 things. First is we try to build our reputation on big complex problems that we can solve for clients in health care and, hopefully, more clients will have an opportunity to see Optum in action and that's a good thing. Second, as Steve mentioned in his opening remarks and Larry just hit on it, we can bring technology outsourcing to this industry in a way that we think is unique to health care. And so we think there's opportunity both in and out of the government for us to do that. And the third, there are situations very much like this around the country and state-based exchanges, where some level of business problem-solving, prioritization and leadership will be called for. And we're happy we were able to jump into those situations as well. \nStephen Hemsley: I'll just finish by reinforcing the fact that we were pleased to be part of that. That was a broad team effort. There were significant efforts and progress made in terms of the participation from CMS, their leadership and their staff. And all of the partners, the outside suppliers around that, everybody pulled together in an extraordinary way to do that, the only way that could have been accomplished. And so, really, the credit really should be spread broadly. \nOperator: We'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. \nChristian Rigg: Just wanted to come back to Medicaid quickly. Understand the comments about the lump sum true-up and that most states or all states have, essentially, verbally agreed to maybe the true-up for the fee. But from a GAAP earnings perspective, does -- can you just help us understand whether you can, on a GAAP basis, just assume you're going to get it in the first quarter and second quarter, if you haven't actually received anything in writing? Or just generally, how the fee might impact EPS on a quarterly basis? \nDaniel Schumacher: Chris, it's Dan Schumacher again. With respect to recognition, obviously, the expense associated with the tax will be incurred in each month across the year. On the revenue recognition, we will rely on written communication. And where we have those, we'll be booking revenue in each of the respective quarters. And where we don't, we'll be weighting what we do. Even though you mentioned lump sum, they may pay in lump sum, but you will recognize appropriate matching once you get a contract. \nStephen Hemsley: Correct. \nChristian Rigg: But so, in theory, this could create a -- if you don't have something inked, at least early in the year, it could create a bit of a headwind in the first, second quarters of '14, is that correct? \nStephen Hemsley: That's why we mentioned it. It's exactly why we mentioned it. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. \nKevin Fischbeck: I want to go back to the commentary around 2015. Obviously, appreciate that it's a little bit early to be talking about it. But with all indications that the 2015 MA rate may be as bad, if not worse, than the 2014 we've seen proposed, can you just give us a sense of what within your business might be doing better in 2015 than 2014? I mean, I just try to -- struggle with the concept. I think you started off by saying you expect growth in 2015 but the impact will really be determined by the final MA rate. So I just want to see if the rate is as bad in 2015 as it is in 2014, what operational levers within MA or outside of MA can you see at this point that might help you show a growth rate better than what you're showing in 2014? \nStephen Hemsley: Well, again, we're not going to speculate on where the funding activity will ultimately play out. We have a very broad and diverse business. We are intensely focused on improving our performance across the board. As you can see, the performance that has been achieved in -- broadly in several areas across UnitedHealthcare. The sense of growth in Medicaid to the very strong performance that we had in the commercial business this past year and the opportunities internationally. And then the opportunities for Optum, I think, are impressive and they have established a track record of performance. And we are intensely focused on our cost and the continued improvement of our businesses. So I would think that they would be all the traditional kinds of things that one would be pursuing. And we are pursuing them, I think, with significant intensity. I just think that in January, off of the strength of a phone call conversation in December with CMS, that we should necessarily take undue direction from that and that we will see how this process proceeds. And as I've said before, I think that there is a broader sense of responsibility to American seniors than to have underfunded the program, by our measures, about 6.7% last year. And if there is speculation that there would be underfunding at that level again in this year, that would be almost a 13% pullback on Medicare Advantage over the course of 2 years. And we would think that, that would be extraordinarily disruptive. It remains to be seen. \nKevin Fischbeck: I appreciate the commentary about the underfunding, it does seem to be a significant cutover a couple of years. But and also, it's very difficult to propose -- or to forecast what's going to come out of CMS at any point of time. But when the rate hits, we have to interpret that the day it happens. And everything that you've outlined to me sounds like things, to your point, that you've been working on for 2014 and you're seeing benefits from them in 2014. I guess the question is, if we see something similar from MA in 2015, if you'd do the same things to offset it in 2015. There is a reason for acceleration outside of the MA business -- or is there, I guess, is my question. \nStephen Hemsley: Well, I think that we have probably more areas to accelerate and to grow and build on than perhaps anyone else in the space. And then we would take the steps necessary with respect to benefit adjustments, market considerations, network actions, premium actions, cost and distribution cost. So there's a broad repertoire of actions that we are taking and the question really comes down to the intensity of those. And that's where we get down to disruption. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. \nRalph Giacobbe: It's obviously still early in the year. But the issues around the roll-out persist. Over time, obviously, you would think that things would start to work themselves out. But just given the timeline of bids due just in the next kind of few months. I guess, what are your thoughts on playing in the exchange in 2015? Should we expect a similar approach and maybe more limited activity? Or have you seen enough where we should start to expect you to be a sort of a more active participant? And then maybe just how much, if at all, is the '15 MA outlook just sort of influential on that decision or not? Or is that sort of something that's kind of mutually exclusive? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. So Gail and Jeff, do you want to start? \nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Well, Ralph, first of all, in terms of the public exchanges, I think you know that we've got a very modest footprint. And as I shared at Investor Day, our decisions around 2015, our participation will really be very much reliant on how this market matures. So at this stage, we're really not projecting our participation. We will be looking at sort of the -- how robust the enrollment is, what the risks in those markets are and the consumers participating and, quite frankly, the cost structure is on those markets. So at this stage, I don't know that we have any additional guidance to give you from what we shared at the investor conference, but that's our outlook. \nRalph Giacobbe: Would you expect to have that, though, just in the next kind of few months? I mean, I'm sure there'll be some level of incremental. \nGail Boudreaux: Again, it's a maturing marketplace. It's really early. It's just rolled out. We'll be looking at a market-by-market basis. So we're not going to give guidance around our participation at this stage, but we're going to watch the markets mature. And we'll get more information and we'll be sharing that with you as it becomes known to us. In terms of your second question on Medicare and does that influence our exchange participation, I would say, no, it doesn't. We're going to look at -- we look at each of our markets very specifically and look at the dynamics in those markets. So we will take a very focused look at exchanges. And as you heard from Steve, we'll also look market-to-market in Medicaid -- Medicare just as we did this year. \nJeff Alter: Generally, our view on '15 is that we are not dependent on exchanges. \nGail Boudreaux: Right. \nJeff Alter: I mean, we will take this in a measured way. \nOperator: We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group. \nSheryl Skolnick: Now my question, though, I'm sensing some sensitivity among investors and, indeed, some of this is on my end. Perhaps I don't understand exactly what kind of pricing decisions you made for 2014 with respect to your estimates of cost trend and a recoupment of the fees through higher premiums where possible. There's a sense out there that, that trend is kind of tied to premium right now and that perhaps, if the fees are 100 to 200 basis points, there's only 80 basis points or so of wiggle room. That was one statistics suggested to me. So I'm wondering if you can comment on that and give us some comfort or some indication of what's happening there, especially with respect to a trigger here, that's the medical cost ratios have been a tad high in the fourth quarter and I'm wondering if that's anything that might be indicative of the pricing versus cost trend in '13 and then in '14, anything in the conversation as we speak. \nStephen Hemsley: So we'll have Jeff kind of speak to that pricing discussion. And if we have not get fully your question, then we'd clarify it on the end. So Jeff, do you want to start? \nJeff Alter: Sheryl, it's Jeff Alter. So I think the market test and their surveys are correct. Our pricing in 2014 is stronger than it was in 2013. And you mentioned it, a part of the reason that it's stronger is because of the ACA fees, taxes, as well as the essential health benefits across all markets. And then when you look at small group and individual, the move to community rating, depending on which part of that marketplace you're looking at, you could see some much stronger pricing. Your suggestion around cost trend versus pricing, just a couple of things to think of. One, we have not changed the discipline of pricing that has gotten us -- has been successful for us for a very long time. We look at our forward cost, which now include, as I mentioned, some impacts due to the ACA. But we're certainly as focused on medical trends as we had ever been in the prediction of medical trend. The medical trend for pricing was   about a point higher in '14 than it was for '13 and we match our premium to that. Again, I know it's been a few years, but we'll go back to the MLR. We manage this across hundreds of intersections, so that we try to stay as close to that rebate line as possible. So depending on which market you're looking at or studying, we may have rebates that are still to be paid in that marketplace. And we're continuing a long how to adjust to that very tight band around that MLR. And in other markets, we have the ability to price a little bit stronger. So that is all in that calculus that creates our forward pricing as we move forward. And now, more than ever, impacts for the ACA are also included in there. \nStephen Hemsley: Good discipline, well-aligned with medical cost trends and, really, not particularly significant changes in the marketplace. We're competitive, but we think we are pricing well. \nSheryl Skolnick: Right. And the MLR performance in the fourth quarter, were you comfortable with that? \nStephen Hemsley: Yes. \nDaniel Schumacher: Sheryl, this is Dan. From a fourth quarter standpoint, as we look at that, medical costs were well controlled. If we look at the implications on both loss ratio and trend, they were very much in keeping with our expectation from Investor Day and set the stage for the right jumping off point into 2014. \nOperator: We'll go next to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Borsch: I wanted to just ask on the commercial enrollment and what you're seeing from employers as sort of 2-part question. Number one, are you seeing anything significant in terms of employee uptake of coverage now that there's this broad awareness of the individual mandates? Some employers, evidently, are seeing that in some cases, I gather, as significant. And somewhat related to that, just curious on comments on the commercial risk enrollment results for the fourth quarter. Just those were stronger than we expected. I just wonder if you could remind us if there was a special factor there. \nJeff Alter: Sure, Matt, it's Jeff Alter. I guess, on your first question, it's sort of hard to tell. I think that would probably most happen in our largest clients. And it takes a little bit past 1/1 to make sure that all those enrollment files are correct. And so we usually feel better about commenting on sort of the National Account growth or growth in existing accounts by the time we get to February, it's a little too early to talk about that. We do see interest for some employers to create a different benefit construct that could allow for growth. But we haven't seen those results come through yet in our 1/1 enrollment. Talking about our fourth quarter '13, I think there were a few things that were driving that. There was a fairly large push in our individual business to sign up as many enrollees as possible early so that we can give that advantage of an additional year without the ACA impact. And that program was an aggressive program and it was very successful. And then we had mentioned probably throughout '13 that there was interest in our small group clients for alternative plan years for them to be able to keep their benefits for that additional year even prior to the president's announcement. So that did drive some, I'll call it one-time growth in the fourth quarter of '13. \nMatthew Borsch: Just so I could understand, because I'm a little confused about it. I would think that those dynamics would make you feel more secure about retention at the small group and individual level but not necessarily explain growth if you're doing early renewals with your current account base. Was there an element to this that also drove some growth? \nJeff Alter: Yes. So in some markets, the value proposition that we put into the market was not matched by some competitors. And so we were able to take some share. And then you're right, it did help attrition. It also helped the sort of retention of groups that might have left anyway. So when you think of a small group attrition rate of somewhere in that 15% to 20%, those groups that were renewing in that fourth quarter, there was a higher attrition rate -- a better retention rate. \nMatthew Borsch: Right. And sorry, just last thing on this. Wouldn't this make you maybe feel a little bit better about the guidance on individual, not that it necessarily moves the needle much, but given what you saw towards year-end? \nJeff Alter: We're not -- at this point, we're not changing our guidance for '14. There's a lot to play out. \nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. \nPeter Costa: Can we talk about OptumRx for a minute and in terms of the growth you expect in 2014 and 2015, probably from outside clients. But also I want to understand how the rule changes that came out on preferred networks will impact you, whether there's integration savings -- integration expenses that you'll save, that you won't have to do next year. And then, from the early marketing window, what are you seeing in terms of how it's starting to look for 2015 and then the potential for your specialty trend to help you win business? \nStephen Hemsley: Okay, 3. Okay, so let's start with growth. I think we had a nice momentum coming out of 2013. Our value prop continues to resonate in the marketplace. If you look at '14 sort of excluding our last wave of the migration, we'll probably grow north of 1.5 million next year. Based on what we sold on 1/1, we'd be confident in that number. As it relates to CMS, I'd like to comment more broadly, I think. What we'd like to see from the CMS proposal, any CMS proposal, is -- and the rule-making is the ability to continue to incent the efficient mail channel and manage preferred networks consistent with historical practices. We believe both those things are really good for the beneficiary and good for the Medicare program. Last thing, specialty trend, I would say a couple of things. I think we continue to have a good advantage with our ability to manage not only the specialty benefit but then -- the specialty spend within the medical benefit but also in our formulary. I think that's a good thing that we've historically done and our trend has reflected that over time. I think that got all your question, does it not? \nPeter Costa: Just integration expenses and then you bringing in the cost from doing the big integration that you've done this year or bringing that PBM in house, is there some substantial savings that we should be expecting going forward? \nStephen Hemsley: Yes, we did recognize that savings. As I talked about at the Investor Day, there's -- we're not changing our guidance for next year. The avoidance of those expenses in 2014 compared to '13 definitely provided us with earnings lift in 2014. \nPeter Costa: And nothing incremental for 2015? \nStephen Hemsley: It's already in our numbers. \nAndrew Slavitt: Yes, I would say that it's already in our numbers. \nPeter Costa: All right. Do you think the changes, the rule changes, if they happen as they are proposed will hurt your competitors more than they will hurt you in terms of preferred networks? \nStephen Hemsley: You know what, I can't really speak to what I think about that right now. We'll hold off. We're sort of in the rule-making phase as we speak right now. We got to let the full rule play out. We'll give our comments during the comment period as will our competitors. We'll be able to speak more deeply about this as the year progresses, when we get a specific visibility into what the rules are. \nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. \nScott Fidel: I just wanted to follow up just on the commercial pricing and cost trends and would be interested if you can maybe drill in just comparing small group and large group for your expectations for 2014. So with the expected 100 bp increase in cost trend, how does that compare between small group and large group? And then maybe just an update on sort of the pricing environment in small group versus large group and whether you're seeing any variance there? \nStephen Hemsley: Jeff? \nJeff Alter: Sure. So we're not going to get into that level of detail in a call like this. I would say the -- just to comment around small group pricing, this is a transitional year for many markets. We're moving out of medically underwritten to community ratings. So I think on a call like this, in a summary discussion, it's hard to discuss small group versus large group when you have such a transition going on in small group as we move to that community rating formula. \nDaniel Schumacher: Yes. And Scott, this is Dan Schumacher. I would just add that, obviously, in small group, there's a lot more variability than there is in large group because small group's going through the transition to adjust to community rating. And based on your health status previously, there's more variation in the price differential at the group level in the market than there is at the large group, which is always okay. I don't think there's any really new change in the marketplace. \nGail Boudreaux: This is Gail. I would just add to Jeff and Dan's comments to the tone of your question, which is that the small group market has remained pretty consistent, with the exception of the change in community rating. The market competitiveness is relatively the same as we commented the last few quarters. \nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. \nJoshua Raskin: Question just broadly about M&A. 2013 was very quiet by United's standards. The deployment of capital for acquisitions is $300 million or so. So I'm curious, is there something in the environment do you think that the level of uncertainty around reform has created a bigger divide between buyers and sellers? Or is there something else going on there? And maybe, I know you guys have talked specifically around a pipeline, per se, for M&A. But with things you're looking at, would you consider it to be similar to what we're seeing in '13? Or do you think there's going to be more opportunity going forward? \nStephen Hemsley: Maybe we'll comment very broadly, but we generally don't like to comment on what our view of the potential expansion marketplace is or what our interest might be or are, because we consider that to be somewhat competitive and strategic. I'd just offer broadly that often, the biggest impediment is valuation and whether we feel comfortable with how the market is valued across a particular set of asset or asset classes. Do you have any comment, Dave? \nDavid Wichmann: Josh, I think I'd just also remind you that we were coming off of the -- at least for us, we were coming off of the Amil acquisition, which was quite substantive the fourth quarter of last year. And what shows up more as a financing activity as opposed to an investing activity is the tender that we did for Amil's public shares, that's about 1.5 billion as well. So it was roughly about 1.8 billion or so allocated to M&A type activity. And lastly, I'll just say, to reiterate the thing at our investor conference, we are clearly a -- an M&A company and our interests in M&A continue. Our agenda is virtually the same, which is really around building these capabilities, geographic market presence. But possibly, a slight bias more towards Optum in the international markets, which we think are fast-growing and expansive markets. But we'd also look to -- for opportunities to leverage our scale broadly in our business. \nOperator: The next question will come from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley. \nAndrew Schenker: Just thinking about Medicaid. Clearly, you don't break out Medicaid MCRs. But at a high level, how should we think about the cost for the business, maybe excluding the industry fee, reflecting kind of the growth and mix that you'll be staying including long-term care duals, the expansion of re-procurement. How big an impact mix had on MCR? And would any changes be temporary once you get these people into your care management programs, or should there be a long shift upward in the MCRs for that product? \nStephen Hemsley: We don't comment -- maybe Steve can make a few comments on this. But in general, we really don't get into margin discussions at that level of depth. We have historically suggested that the range of margin for those businesses in the 3% to 5%, 3% to 6% level, depending upon the performance of the business in a particular year. And that mix, ultimately, even if one offering were to be particularly strong, it tends to generally, ultimately come down into that general range of 3% to 5% for that kind of business. And we're really not changing our perspective on that. And I think that's well aligned with the marketplace. That said, Steve, do you have anything to offer? \nSteve Nelson: Stephen, I think those are good comments. I would just say generally, they -- the opportunities to grow in Medicaid are robust and they include a variety of populations. For example, more complex populations, the expansion population has different utilization characteristics, at least the first, as Dan mentioned. And as we engage with them and are -- both the complex population and expansion population, engage with them our distinctive clinical models and our pride of capabilities that we have, I think, a really strong track record, we'll be able to bring a lot of value to our state partners and good outcomes to these populations. So it's part of our business. It's part of the growth opportunity. And we're actually -- really like our position and our opportunities in the space. And just to expand on Steve's earlier comments in the beginning, really strong track record in competing successfully for this business with that. \nStephen Hemsley: Yes, it's a very localized business, local programs. So these margins run their range from year-to-year across that -- those geographies. And given our scale, we aspire to the higher ends of those margins. But we will run the range of those margins across our markets over time. So it is a business with a great deal of variation market to market. \nOperator: Our final question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. \nDavid Windley: On specialty drugs, I'm hoping to get the sense of magnitude. Do the hep C drugs have the potential to make a meaningful impact on the trend in specialty? And from a rate advocacy standpoint, are you having discussions with the states, as I understand, a lot of this may hit Medicaid, are you having discussions with the states about them potentially backstopping you in some way on the cost of drug life stability? \nStephen Hemsley: So Dirk, do you want to comment in general. And then I think that sounds to me more like a Medicaid question than a drug question. But maybe you want to talk about the specialty additions. \nDirk McMahon: Yes, well, just hep C in general, I think -- we know that new therapies have recently been launched. The competition is valuable for our strategy at state. Like any other drugs, we compare the efficacy versus the cost of these drugs. And when we look at those, we'll decide where to place them from a tier perspective. We would, of course, steer utilization from a tier strategy standpoint to those that produce the most effective and most efficient outcome. So we're really about trying to manage the overall drug/medical spend as we sort of take our approach to pharmacy management, I think hep C is similar. And as far as where they are in the trend, I'll turn it back to Steve. \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. So from -- we do expect higher utilization of these drugs in 2014. We did see that in 2012 as well when we had the new introductions that came in mid 2011. But that's obviously something that's part of our forward outlook. It's contemplated in our pricing. In terms of the implications on our trend, we are talking basis point, not points, and it's fully reflected in our forward outlook. With respect to Medicaid specifically, just as the insurers' fee and other elements are components of cost, it is an element that goes into our build-up. It's an active part of our dialogue to the extent that we're covering pharmacy benefits in a state and it will be part of our beta process that Steve Nelson talked about.\n So thank you. I would say that, that will conclude our comments today. We remain intensely focused on the challenges and the opportunities of 2014 and 2015. And we thank you for joining us and thank you for your continued interest in our enterprise. Thank you. \nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 3, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-10-17 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. \n Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectation. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports & SEC Filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 17, 2013, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead. \nStephen Hemsley: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we will review our third quarter results and update you on our view of market trends and developments as we approach 2014. \n In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.53 per share on revenues of $30.6 billion. Revenues grew 12% year-over-year, with continued diversification across businesses and product types. Cash flows from operations were strong at $3.4 billion, more than 2x our net earnings for the quarter. \n The consistency of our efforts and results is guided by a focus on serving the distinct needs of all health system participants: those who receive, deliver and who pay for care. No other company is engaged so diversely across health care. Our services all center around the same 3 competencies cultivated for nearly 2 decades: the organization and optimization of health resources at the local market level, the application of data and the enabling use of advanced technology. \n Over the long term, this approach continues to produce distinguishing results: record growth from those who have experienced our products and services, well-controlled medical and operating cost trends and improved affordability and access to health care. The emergence of public exchanges, private exchanges, Medicaid expansions, growing dual eligible and long-term care need, accountable care experimentation, rising consumerism and the confluence of these elements have the potential to create new opportunities for us to grow and serve in new ways. We continue to adapt to the market's changing need. We offer consumers and customers an unparalleled array of health products, services and capabilities, and we are steadily advancing along themes of consumer responsiveness, simplicity and affordability. \n Turning to the quarter. Our 12% revenue growth, solid earnings results and steady operating disciplines grow strong cash flows of $3.4 billion, bringing year-to-date cash flow to nearly $6 billion. As expected, the third quarter operating margin of 8.6% decreased from last year, primarily due to government underfunding of the Medicare Advantage program and nearly 40 basis points of impact from lower reserve development. These were partially offset by strong margin expansion in Health Services at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.\n Operating costs were well controlled at 15.9% of revenue. Our percentage operating costs are 20 basis points higher than the third quarter 2012 despite year-over-year services growth of 25% or more than twice the growth rate of health premiums. That said, we have intense efforts underway to continue to increase the overall level of productivity and realize cost savings across our businesses. \n Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was comfortably under 35% at September 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in available cash. Year-to-date shareholder dividend payment increased nearly 30% to $777 million. We have purchased about 37 million shares so far in 2013 at an average price just under $64 per share, bringing our pure share count now under 1 billion shares. \n Turning to business level results. UnitedHealthcare earned $2 billion on revenues of $28.4 billion in the third quarter. UnitedHealthcare's momentum continues as the fastest-growing health benefits company in the market. It increased the number of people served by 24%, nearly 9 million individuals, over the past year. This includes more than 2.9 million people in TRICARE and another 4.8 million people in Brazil, both new markets for us. \n Within our traditional domestic markets, growth has also remained strong. Over the last year, we have grown to serve 1 million more people today in the employers, individuals, senior and public markets. This growth is varied and diverse across geographies, products and market segment. UnitedHealthcare is achieving consistent results by aligning modern benefit design with strong consumer engagement, empowerment, tools, programs and incentives. These are further aligned to targeted clinical management and wellness programs that channel care delivery through a focused set of networks with proven performance capability and with progressively higher levels of care provider financial incentives for quality outcomes and patient satisfaction. \n For many years, we have used our commitment to and insight into local market communities to shape our capabilities to fit each unique market as a provider of health benefits. These same local market insights and relationships play out in our accountable care strategy, which continues to differentiate UnitedHealthcare. \n We closed the quarter with more than $25 billion in annual medical spending, driving a spectrum of first-generation care provider performance incentives. Today, the health care experience of more than 2 million people we serve are directly aligned, end-to-end, through the most progressive of these arrangements, including full risk, shared risk and bundled episodic care payment approaches. \n We entered into several new ACO partnerships in the quarter, including our first multi-entity ACO with Quality Health Solutions, a collaborative of 4 hospital systems and the Medical College of Wisconsin, all in the southeast corner of that state. More importantly, we are making significant gain-sharing payments to several of our ACO partners based on the actual outcomes they are achieving to improve quality and care effectiveness and efficiency for patients. This includes Optum's care delivery network earning payments for its work to improve performance for both UnitedHealthcare and organizations outside UnitedHealth Group. \n In the third quarter, UnitedHealthcare growth was, again, led by senior market performance. We added 100,000 seniors with Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement benefits and sold 95,000 additional Medicare Part D drug plans. We expect to finish 2013 with market-leading growth momentum coming through these Medicare offerings. We have already grown by 670,000 people in Part D through the first 9 months of the year. \n While our overall Medicare star ratings for 2015 have advanced year-over-year, we believe we can and must execute much better than these ratings reflect. We are intensely focused on steady and significant improvement in this critical performance area. \n In Medicaid, UnitedHealthcare grew by 15,000 people in the quarter and was honored to be selected for new awards serving Florida and rural Texas, which will begin over the course of 2014. The number of consumers served through UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual grew by 30,000 in the quarter despite expected in-group attrition. 2013 will be the fourth consecutive year UnitedHealthcare grows commercial membership organically. And UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans membership in TRICARE was well served, but this transitional issue is now well in hand. \n UnitedHealthcare International has added almost 400,000 people so far this year, with particular strength in the large group market. Our UnitedHealthcare International medical assistance and clinics business continues to grow and advance, recently receiving new contracts to serve the global oil and gas industry in the Middle East, Africa and now in the North Atlantic. \n Optum's technology-enabled services, again, grew strongly in a market sized at over $500 billion. Our growth potential is particularly compelling as we continue to develop broader, more integrated long-term relationships with larger clients who are pursuing new approaches to the market. \n Earlier this week, we announced the formation of the Optum360 business with our partner, Dignity Health. Working collaboratively and applying advanced Optum technologies, we expect to improve revenue cycle performance end-to-end, from the perspectives of both patients and care providers, across Dignity's 39 hospitals and 300 care centers in 21 states. \n Through the Optum360 business, we are together creating the next-generation performance organization dedicated to bringing these resources to serve a broad base of large health care systems across the U.S. To that end, we are engaged with other care provider systems and believe Optum360 will develop into a sizable and impactful business. \n Earlier this week, we announced a multiyear extension and expansion through 2020 of our new 15-year relationship with AARP. Through this extension, we will continue to advance the overall missions of AARP with the broadest offering of senior products and services around health and wellbeing. \n Also this week, consulting firm Mercer announced it was using both the Optum multi-carrier private exchange platform called myCustomHealth and UnitedHealthcare's dedicated exchange platform to serve benefit choice needs of retirees and larger employers. \n And earlier this year, we created Optum Labs to combine and analyze both clinical and administrative data from large patient populations. Insights from Optum Labs' research will advance knowledge and understanding of every aspect of care delivery, from care protocols to therapeutic agent performance and more. We expect these research efforts to lead to new and better products and services and improved overall system performance. \n The Mayo Clinic Health System is a founding partner of Optum Labs, as is AARP. And other important national relationships are also in various levels of engagement. With these, Optum Labs has the potential to effectively become the national research platform for health care data analytics. \n These initiatives, combined with several other important business relationships and awards this year, are the results of our efforts to align Optum around 3 major growth drivers: modernizing health system infrastructure, aligning and enabling the highest quality of both effective and efficient care delivery and engaging the consumer. These drivers define the broad business opportunities emerging as health care evolves and support our optimism and confidence in Optum's sustained double-digit growth. And Optum's operating performance was strong again this quarter. Each business repeated double-digit revenue gain. Overall, revenues rose 33% year-over -- over last year to $9.6 billion, led by the 41% increase at OptumRx. \n Operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 6.6%, despite the increasing mix of comparatively lower-margin pharmacy revenues. As of today, our OptumRx pharmacy migration is 96% complete. More than 11 million consumers have transitioned and are now served by OptumRx. Our team has successfully executed the largest-scale and most complex membership transition in the health care industry. \n Optum's strong revenue growth, combined with margin expansion, has driven exceptional earnings performance. Optum's earnings grew 54% year-over-year this quarter and 69% year-to-date. Optum is now contributing nearly 1/4 of UnitedHealth Group's operating earnings, up from 16% 1 year ago. We believe Optum will achieve our 2015 margin target of 6% in 2013, 2 years earlier than originally planned. \n The combined and complementary performances of Optum and UnitedHealthcare produced very solid third quarter results, as we discussed at the outset, with quarterly revenues up $3.3 billion over last year, driven by increasing diversification, producing earnings of $1.53 per share with cash flows of $3.4 billion. We're achieving our full year results against headwinds ranging from intense government reimbursement pressures, including an unplanned $0.15 per share sequestration impact and $0.17 per share in lower reserve development as compared to the strong reserve development levels of last year. And we're getting there while continuing to make significant investments in our businesses, including the increased level of fourth quarter investment in OptumInsight. \n All in, we are tightening our outlook for 2013 net earnings to a range of $5.40 to $5.50 per share. At the raised midpoint of $5.45, this would translate to a strong 15% year-over-year earnings growth targeted for the fourth quarter this year. \n Our balance sheet strength continues to differentiate UnitedHealth Group. In the past week, both S&P and Moody's affirmed our corporate debt ratings and upgraded their outlook. We continue to project cash flows from operations in a range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion and expect to return $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend. \n Looking forward, we expect our 2014 earnings outlook to be impacted by overall Medicare Advantage funding levels, as well as the effects of a nondeductible insurer fee on Medicare, as we indicated in our last earnings call. The significant and continued level of underfunding cannot be fully offset in 2014 from the performance effects we expect from the balance of our health benefits market, and we see limited potential for dramatic further improvement in overall medical cost trends, recognizing how well medical costs have been controlled over 2012 and 2013.\n We fully expect Optum to again grow and perform strongly, and we are well along in far-reaching efforts to improve productivity and control operating costs across the entire enterprise. And we will, as always, endeavor to use capital judiciously. \n Given that overall landscape, we expect our 2014 earnings outlook, which we will introduce and discuss in detail at our December 3 investor conference, will once again begin the year with a broad earnings range that will likely straddle, to the upside and to the downside, our current year performance outlook of $5.40 to $5.50 per share. We will, of course, be focused on performing to the highest possible level. 2014 and 2015 represent periods we have long described as challenging in the near term, followed by the potential for several years of growth and advancement once these markets changes are digested. The history of market changes in the health care sector over the past 50 years bears that out. Our own historical performance provides some context. It is worth noting that today, we generate more than $1.5 billion in operating earnings from businesses we were not even in at the start of 2006. We have grown earnings per share at a 14% annual rate since the end of 2009, accompanied by strong cash flow growth, while going through the most prolonged economic and employment downturn in nearly a century. \n Over the last 10 years, we quadrupled our market share and health benefits from a starting point of 3%, yet today, we are only 13% penetrated into the overall U.S. population. While we have the largest enterprise serving the Health Care Services market, we estimate our penetration into that $0.5 trillion market at just 6%. Today, our businesses serving Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries are approaching parity with our 30-year-old commercial health benefit businesses. \n Optum is ahead of our \"15 by '15\" commitment and moving rapidly to our goal of representing well more than 30% of our overall income contribution and growing at a strong and accelerating pace. We are committed to thoughtful growth pursuing the international market, where emerging economies and fully developed nations both recognize the need to meet the growing health care needs of their people and are looking to the private sector to play a key role. \n And here in the U.S., we have recently taken important steps for the adjacent primary care market focused on serving populations whose needs are high, where we can make a positive difference to them and to their benefit sponsors, one of the most fragmented yet influential of all sectors across the health care landscape. We can only be certain of one thing, that UnitedHealth Group will look meaningfully different 10 years from today. We are committed to being a differentiating factor in a better health care system and to grow and productively use capital in the process. \n We look forward to your questions today, so we turn to the moderator. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. \nJustin Lake: First question. Just a follow-up on your 2014 commentary, Steve. I just want to make sure I was clear on that. So it sounds like the UHC business will be down in earnings year-over-year, with Medicare Advantage driving down. Any color on how the commercial and Medicaid businesses will look? \nStephen Hemsley: Yes. Well, we're going to kind of try to keep our -- this call is not the time when we get into the details of this. We provide guidance at the investor conference, and I really don't want to front run that process. So I will leave it kind of in the context that we put it, that when you look at the businesses in total, pressure that's on the Medicare Advantage program from the funding pressures that we have talked about for some time, and then look at the performance of the balance of the businesses, each of whom have their challenges and their opportunities both, we come out in a range that, as I said, straddles with both upside to where we are today, as well as probably a downside starting point. And that's largely where we think we'll probably position 2014 as we go in. And we're going to try not to provide a great deal more detail than that other than the portfolio has that potential within it and that we are focused on a number of things that we think will drive towards the upper end of that performance. But that execution remains to be done, and so we will kind of keep it in that kind of context this morning, and then we'll talk about it in much more detail when we get to the investor conference. \nJustin Lake: Okay. And then just a question on Optum. Can you give us some color on the Optum360 revenue opportunity post the Dignity announcement? And also, on the PBM, can you give us an update on the Medco integrations and how you're positioned heading into the '15 selling season? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I'll let Larry kick that off. \nLarry Renfro: So Justin, it's Larry. I'm assuming you read the announcement about our arrangement with Dignity Health. As we said earlier in the year, we were going to try to establish what I would call a larger, deeper, more complex relationship with our clients, and I would say that Optum360 is an example of that. We won't go into the detail of contracts, or we won't go into the detailed numbers, but what I would say about that is that it is a multiyear, multi-billion dollar contract, and it is a next-generation RCM that we are starting with them that will -- candidly, will simplify patient billing and -- as well as modernize health care administration. So a nice win, nice venture that we put together, and more to come on that. And I'll ask Dirk to handle the PBM. \nDirk McMahon: Yes, thanks, Larry. I guess what I would say is the PBM migration and the success has given the market confidence that we can compete. It's given us a lot of scale to be able to purchase more effectively. And I think, candidly, our synchronization, as well as specialty value propositions, are resonating well in the marketplace. So my commentary on '15 is that ultimately, we've -- not a lot has moved, but what business has moved, we've won more than our fair share. So I think we're really well positioned for '15. \nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please? And we'll try to keep it to one per. That was a nice portfolio of questions on that one, but we'll try to keep it to one each. \nOperator: And our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. \nAlbert Rice: Maybe I'll just ask you to flesh out a little more on your comments about the Medicare Advantage outlook. Obviously, you've now got some competitive information available. Can you give us your assessment of the landscape moving into next year, prospects for overall enrollment growth in that segment and maybe for the market overall, if you have any thoughts on that? And anything you could say on the margin outlook on that? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I'll have Jack comment on that. But I think, as we look at the benefits, we see that and our position as pretty positive. Jack? \nJack Larsen: Thanks, A.J. Good morning. So in 2014, once again, we are looking at a market opportunity that expands upwards of 3 million seniors or so, many of whom who we think will be well positioned to select Medicare Advantage. And I think in our planning this year, we started where we start every year, and that is with identifying the benefits that seniors value most while keeping the year-over-year total cost ranges to them as low as possible. This year was obviously made far more difficult than prior years given the reductions in the effective rates that we received versus the expected medical cost trend. So you have, I'm sure, no doubt seen some of the competitive plan offerings. And while it's still very early in OEP, I think today is the third day of selling, I'd have to say that we're pleased. We're pleased with where we positioned ourselves competitively in our key markets. And we're pleased with some of the things that we are seeing in terms of the leading indicators coming from our field sales teams, our web portals and the busyness of our call centers. Now in terms of growth, I think, as Steve shared in his opening comments, we had industry-leading growth in 2013, something we're very happy with. I would say at this distance, though, when we come to you at the investor conference, we will be positioning our growth as moderating off of the sort of blistering rate we've had this year. And keep in mind that we're approaching 2014 with almost 150,000 people impacted by our plan withdrawal. So I'm sure we'll have lots more to say about that at the investor conference in the next few weeks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. \nDavid Styblo: It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. I had just a question on the private exchange, and if you could talk a little bit more about your strategy there, how you guys are approaching it and what sort of success you're having this year, as well as the enrollment cycle that's going forward so far? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Gail, do you want to start it off? \nGail Boudreaux: Good morning. It's Gail Boudreaux. First of all, in terms of the overall exchange market, we see -- we're very positive about it. We see it as a significant opportunity both for UnitedHealthcare and for Optum. And I think one of the things to remember, the private exchange market isn't brand new. While it's certainly seeing some acceleration going into 2014, we have had offerings, strong product offerings and feel very well positioned in a number of those markets. Thinking about the private exchange market, I think you have to think about 2 subsectors of it. One is the retiree exchange, and that retiree exchange has had a very consistent movement over the last few years of employers moving into either group Medicare or into private exchange offerings. Again, our product offerings there have continued to grow and are very strong. We also offer, through Optum, an opportunity to do a multiemployer exchange, which has seen increased enrollment and we expect to see solid enrollment going forward. The active space is really getting a lot of recent press. You heard, in Steve's comments, our offering. We participate pretty broadly, actually, and again, feel that we have a very strong product offering in the private active exchange, and we expect to continue to see growth. From our perspective, there's a number of different types. Certainly, the movement from a self-funded offering to a fully insured offering is a positive for us. But overall, we're pretty optimistic and positive, and we see them as an expanding distribution channel going forward. And maybe I'll ask Mike Weissel to comment a little bit about the Optum opportunity because we work mostly with Optum as well and see their opportunity. \nMike Weissel: Thanks, Gail. David, this is Mike Weissel, Executive Vice President at Optum. And from our perspective, we really see 2 major opportunities for us in the exchange marketplace. The first is just acting as an enablement platform using our myCustomHealth platform to work with payers, providers, states, employers; really, anyone who needs that platform for doing an exchange. But maybe the greater opportunity and the more exciting opportunity for us is how we utilize all the Optum products to assist our client. So any company moving to a private exchange often has a greater need for incentives, wellness, care-management capabilities to create a consistent experience across their membership. And we just see a strong market for ourselves over time in really using our services to meet that need. \nStephen Hemsley: So for us, basically, exchanges have 2 dimensions. It is a great new channel for us, and we'll participate in that channel. And then for our Optum business, it is not -- we can not only be a channel as that, but also enable others. So we really see exchanges as having 2 business dimensions for us. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. \nPeter Costa: I'd like to zoom in a little bit on the cost trend commentary, about it not being a helper going forward. And also, combine that with the fact that payroll PPD went from sort of a helper by $100 million last quarter to a headwind of $100 million this quarter. Can you contrast that with your commentary and talk about whatever you see going on with the medical cost trend? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I'll have Dan talk to medical cost trends. But we've had very strong performance in those over the last 2 years. And I think our only signaling was there's only so much you can expect to achieve out of that, so I think that was really the nexus of it. I don't think we're really planning on offering any new or enlightening views about where trends will be. Dan? \nDaniel Schumacher: Sure. Good morning, Peter. Dan Schumacher. With respect to our medical cost performance, as Steve said, we're very pleased with it over the course of the year thus far. But obviously, this is a space where our work is never [indiscernible]. As you look underneath it, I would tell you that inpatient is an area that continues to be very distinguished for us. So as you look at each of the 3 quarters this year, in each of our 3 businesses, we have lowered our bed days. And that's been true for the last 4 years. So doing well on the inpatient side. As you look at the commercial space, in particular, we've had, against our expectations, some improvement in the outpatient as well as we continue to focus our program around out-of-network spend, around the appropriate site of service and things like that. When you put it together at the commercial market level, we have a trend expectation that we provided was 5% to 6%, and we now expect to be at the other lower end of that range. As you think about the development, I wouldn't read into the variation of that quarter-to-quarter or business-to-business. Some of the factors that influence that, obviously, is our operating performance stability. But also, those programs that I was talking about, in outpatient as an example. As we introduce those programs and they begin to come into -- in full effect, we start to realize those in our actuarial process. So there is differences in timing quarter-to-quarter and business-to-business. \nStephen Hemsley: And last year, we did have exceptional levels of reserve development, and that fits into the narrative of the contrast between the third quarters -- third year  [ph] of '12 versus '13. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Christian Rigg with Susquehanna. \nChristian Rigg: Just wanted to touch a little on the Medicaid business and the industry fee there. I know we're getting kind of late into 2013 now. Any sense for whether you expect some margin leakage there because of the tax? Do you think you're generally going to be made whole in most states? Any color would be helpful. \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Steve Nelson, want to take that? \nSteve Nelson: Sure. Good morning, Chris. It's Steve Nelson. We actually have made a lot of progress in that area since last quarter. We have a twisted  [ph] kind of level, so we have a very robust and consistent rate advocacy process where we're consistently engaged with our states around rates in general, and the insurer fee and the tax impact of that is a part of that ongoing conversation. And I'll tell you, at this point, we have about 1/4 of our states that have formally committed to including both the fee and the tax impact in the rate. And while we have a lot more work to do, the conversations we've had so far have been very productive and positive. I would say, very much in line with our expectations. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. \nKevin Fischbeck: Great. I appreciate your -- the fact that you're probably not going to have an ability to put a fine point to this at all yet at this point, but just the commentary around the headwinds to MA for 2014 just kind of beg the question about what the implications are for 2015 because, as we look at 2015, we already know we have the health care reform cuts to the rates. We have the clearing adjustment. We have the industry fee increasing. We have -- you mentioned the stars maybe didn't improve as much as you would want them to. So there's a number of headwinds in 2015, which may argue that the rate situation in '15 might not be dramatically better than 2014. So I just wanted to understand if there's any good reason to think that the headwinds in '15 would be any better a starting point for thinking about what 2015 looks like as to kind of how you think about how 2014 is going to shape up. \nStephen Hemsley: Well, I think you have a good list of the headwinds that we all see and have talked about, so you have been attentive to our calls over the last couple of quarters. Those are the things that concern us about, basically, the funding approaches that have taken into the Medicare Advantage program because it does serve 1/4 of the U.S. seniors and is the fastest-growing and, by far, the most popular of the programs. So that's why we have been vocal about it in that context. So those headwinds are real. Now we are clearly pushing back against those in terms of how we're approaching the business. And I'll let Jack speak to some of the actions that we're taking along those lines. And our star performance clearly has to improve. We are not pleased with our execution there, and that is something that we have to address. But we are positioning that business, and that business has grown very nicely. And we want to kind of balance the position of that business and continue to grow it because long term, Medicare Advantage and whatever other products come forward in the private sector as Medicare are going to be important because the pressures that you're seeing in the funding from these programs are the pressures that are felt in the program in total, and the private sector is the best outlet for that. I'll let Jack... \nKevin Fischbeck: Just before you can get the clarification... \nStephen Hemsley: I'll let Jack respond. Sorry. \nKevin Fischbeck: I was just going to say that -- yes, I'd love to hear Jack's perspective. But just to clarify, do you feel that 2015 headwinds are the same or worse or better than what you're seeing for 2014? \nStephen Hemsley: We don't know. I would certainly hope that funding actions are stronger than they were -- have been in the last couple of years. And then unique to us, I think that we need to improve our star performance, and that's going to affect us in '15. That's the thing I would say would be unique to us. Jack? \nJack Larsen: So hey, good morning, Kevin. Jack Larsen. So I guess, maybe, first things first. You've articulated all the headwinds that we're seeing. And we certainly, early on, recognized that the shifting of all of the legislative and regulatory prompted rate reductions, recalibrations, insurers' taxes, channeling them through benefit design changes to seniors would have been absolutely crushing, both to them individually as well as, I think, to the sustainability of the program itself. We also recognize that, notwithstanding that point of view on overall reimbursements, that we have a responsibility to ensure that we are doing all that we can to make sure that we make the basic product as affordable and as accessible as possible. The kind of work we're doing is making sure that we have the highly performing, best-in-class networks that are aligned not only with us and the physicians, but with the members as well. We are doubling down on efficiency of our clinical programs. And then, of course, the never-ending battle we wage on operating cost. All of that sort of goes in to make the MA program sustainable in individual market. And so I think with the work we did in 2014 puts us in a good position to take on those challenging headwinds in 2015. Let me spend a moment on stars since that, I think, was embedded in part of your question. I would say, overall that we're pleased with the progress we've made. We have almost 2.5x more of our members in 4-star or better plans for 2014 that will impact the 2015 payment year. And you need to keep in mind that, that star rating represents the activities that we did in 2012. So while that's a nice percentage gain overall, I'd have to say that we're admittedly starting off from a relatively low level. And we have, as Steve said, much more work to do to get to the point where we're making the progress we should. I can tell you that we have an intense level of focus all around the company, starting with Steve on down to the UnitedHealthcare organization. Also, within our Optum colleagues. Who are really a significant part of our overall success. \nStephen Hemsley: We are focused on this sector, for sure. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. \nJoshua Raskin: So I guess I want to talk a little bit about MA in the context of the overall UnitedHealth Group. And I think you guys historically have talked about the sort of 13% to 16% earnings per share growth. Obviously, we're not going to get too close to that this year. And then it sounds like -- I don't know what straddling means exactly, but it sounds like the midpoint should be something relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. So it would imply -- and if the overall business is growing even just low teens, then MA is going to be down by 1/3 in terms of profitability next year. And so I look at your market actions, and I understand there's been some product exits, but you guys are entering 4 new states -- or counties in 4 different states, new counties altogether. And so I guess I'm just a little bit confused as to what the actual magnitude in terms of the headwind on MA. Are we really looking at a business that's going to lose 1/3 of its profitability in 1 year? \nStephen Hemsley: Now so, again, let's go back to the first question. We'll talk about 2014 in more specific terms at the investor conference, and we will go through each of the business lines along those lines. The pressure on MA is not a new subject. We have been talking about this through the course of the year. We have a lot of opportunities to improve the performance of that business, but we have to take a look realistically at the funding levels that have been imposed there. And the other businesses also have their individual pressures. So we're going to talk about them on a line-by-line basis at the investor conference and then as a total portfolio. But if I go back to the range, we are clearly focused on growing earnings in 2014. And the range that we're beginning with encompasses that upside potential. And I don't know, I think it's appropriate for us to be very direct with you all about the headwinds that are in the marketplace, and we have done that with you each year, and to position ourselves appropriately in a range because there are a range of performance outcomes that could occur as a result of those headwinds, not all of which are fully predictable. But we are putting forward, I think, an appropriate and, I would say, positive context when thinking about '14, that we are discussing a range that has upside performance above the upper range of our current year performance. So I think I would walk away from that, to my view, in a positive context. There is a lot of work we will have to do to perform that upper end, but we are clearly focused on that. \nJoshua Raskin: So I think, Steve, I think I understand the context in which your range will encompass potential upside relative to this year. I guess I'm still trying to figure out and quantify what the actual impact from MA, as you guys have talked about the funding challenges as you... \nStephen Hemsley: Josh, I know you're trying to quantify that, but we are not going to get into quantifying... \nJoshua Raskin: December 3. \nStephen Hemsley: MA or commercial or Optum or any of the other businesses this morning. Otherwise, there will be not much left to talk about at the investor conference. \nJoshua Raskin: I'll also show up on December 3. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. \nScott Fidel: I was wondering if you could help us think about how pricing is shaping up in the market for commercial and individual and small group, both on and off the exchanges? And then, without getting into too much detail, maybe if you can help us think directionally about how you're thinking about enrollment for commercial large group and national accounts for next year. \nStephen Hemsley: So maybe Gail to start out, and then Jeff to comment. \nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Good morning. A couple of questions there. Let me start with the pricing question. First, on the commercial pricing environment, we've talked about this on, I think, every call I've been on. It remains a competitive environment. What -- this year is a little different in that every year, we see -- I call them different themes that play out in each of our local markets. And some of those themes this year are around what I'll call very selective disruption. It's not broad, but there are some of that playing out, as well as some of the early renewals that are occurring in the market. I think what's important to know about our approach is we haven't changed our pricing approach. It's staying very consistent, our controls and discipline are staying consistent, and our focus really is around the value-based products that we put in the market over the last couple of years and feel that those will resonate very well. In terms of -- I think your second question was on national account enrollment. I'm going to ask Jeff to comment on what's happening there. But before I go, actually, you had asked about pricing in the public exchanges. And our comments on that -- as you know, we have taken a very modest position in the public exchanges. And unlike any other new entry into a market, these are structurally different market-to-market, very similar to our existing portfolio, so you have to look at those. Again, our approach in those markets is very consistent, and we look at things that are basically 2 functions when we set our price. One is  the expected cost of the product and network configuration is an important part of that, and then the expected cost of the people to enroll. And that discipline has stayed very consistent. As we look at the pricing across the public exchanges, you would expect to see a broader range because of it being a new market and, quite frankly, the network product configurations that are in the marketplace today. So I don't think that's unexpected, but that's essentially what we are seeing. And I'll ask Jeff to comment on the national account marketplace. \nJeff Alter: Thanks. Scott, it's Jeff Alter. Now just to wrap up with Gail, so on pricing because, obviously, pricing and our enrollment outlook are tied together. So again, we remain unchanged in our discipline in our pricing to flow with cost. And sometimes, as you know, over our history, in doing that, it can tend to cause us to give share back within the short term. So as we think about our enrollment in '14, keeping it at high level, obviously, sitting in the middle of October, there are a lot of things still to play out. But we do expect our enrollment to be down next year. And as Steve said in his comments, we've come off a string of very successful years, but we expect that down to happen primarily in a couple of areas. One, we've mentioned that the national account season, early on, had a structural change in that the pipeline for new business and existing accounts was the lowest we had seen in a number of years. And probably based upon all the changes at the national level in the health care system, many of our national account clients sat still. We've mentioned it before in this morning about the impact of private exchanges, which we think are going to be positive overall financially. But as we do transition some of our businesses and some of our clients that are total replacement into an open exchange model, it would be prudent to believe we're not going to continue to have the total population back. But financially, it's still a very good trade. And then we've got our individual business, which I'll start right out by saying is not a large contributor to our financial performance, but we do have about 900,000 individuals who will be impacted. So that's -- those are those tranches. And then I think we've talked about this, and the world knows about this, the largest driver of our outlook for down for next year is the loss of that large public sector account, which we are protesting but, at this point, believe it's appropriate to say that's a loss. So those are the -- that's where we're looking at our outlook. Obviously, we'll have a lot more detail in December for you. \nScott Fidel: That's helpful. And if I could just clarify on that. So are you saying that when you say expect to be down, is that overall commercial membership, or is that both overall commercial membership and national accounts membership? I just want to make sure that we have that clear. \nJeff Alter: Both. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nRalph Giacobbe: I just wanted to go back to public exchanges. And I know you guys provided some commentary already, and obviously, you guys have taken a more cautious stance, at least initially. I guess, again, now that you've seen the pricing, are you surprised at some of those levels and maybe some of the strategies some have taken? And then any concern of sort of spillover effect onto the commercial pricing environment over time because of that? \nStephen Hemsley: Gail, you want to... \nGail Boudreaux: So I'll go back to -- again, there's a few embedded questions in there. The pricing environment in the public exchanges, again, ours is a pretty modest footprint. And there, I think it's hard to draw conclusions at this stage from what we see in the pricing from that market because it is based on a whole group of factors that are not necessarily in the broader small group market. So I think that's the first thing. And it does really rely on the estimate of the product configuration, the network that was chosen, as well as the expectation of what the population of enrollment is in that network. So from that perspective, again, while I can't comment on others, we did expect to see some diversity. And we think over the long term that as people get experience and understand what's happening in that market, we will see that come into a tighter range would be our expectation. And then in terms of our pricing philosophy, I keep going back to we've been very consistent. We're keeping that same consistent methodology. The one change that's happening in the marketplace, as you know, is the market is going to adjust to community ratings. So that is a change in the marketplace, but it's something we're well prepared for, and a large part of our business is already in that model given the states we work in. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group. \nSheryl Skolnick: Steve, I'm very intrigued by your commentary, more qualitative, obviously, than quantitative, about 2014 because my sense is the early perception of the initial straddle guidance, in loose terms, was negative. And yet when you clarified it, which was very helpful, you suggested that we walk away from it positive. And I think it was negative because it was seen initially, early e-mail contact, as being a reversal of your prior commentary, which, on the second quarter call, I think you said that you're intensely focused on, if not committed to, achieving -- finding ways to achieve growth in 2014 despite the headwinds. So let me just clarify, if I may. So you said you'd walk away from this positively. Stock is down. Obviously, the street's walking away from it negatively. This seems to me to be a continuation of what you said before, except represented in a range around current year guidance. That's question #1. \nStephen Hemsley: That's exactly right. So I don't know how many questions you'll have, but that one, if -- go back to our commentary, and we do pay attention to what we said in the prior teleconferences, we see today's commentary to be completely consistent with that. We would always put them out in a range, and what we are really signaling is that, that range will have an upper end, and we are basically confirming that today. \nSheryl Skolnick: Right, okay. So that is good news because obviously, with all the headwinds, it could have been negative. So the real question, if you can give me some qualitative sense, are the things that would have to go right to get to an upper end of that range versus a lower end of that range in very broad terms, the positive influences that you see, because we've heard a lot about the negatives. But I'm interested in the opportunity to achieve that upper end, which, again, would temper the negatives for today or decide maybe it's inappropriate to temper that negative. \nStephen Hemsley: I'll do my best. But basically, we laid some of the trends out in the teleconference. We expect our performance on our services businesses, our Optum businesses and the services business in United to continue to grow and perform strongly. We said that in the teleconference. We must execute at very high levels along things that are hard to do because the medical cost trends have been so well managed. We have to continue to not only manage them well, but manage them better than we have. We have to execute on strategies we discussed before on Medicare, around -- focused on specific targeted markets, narrowing networks, ever effective -- there are areas where we could make progress in terms of effective care management on the ground level. It would be in the Medicare book of business. Those kinds of elements, managing and taking our productivity and operating cost disciplines to a next-level performance, which I think we are very capable of doing, are all areas that we see as opportunities. And kind of even to just the last area of discussion, as I think you all well know that sometimes, to improve performance and improve it on the long term, you have to do things in the short term that don't -- that have a longer-term logic to them. So you have to really hold the pricing discipline. Sometimes, you will have to give back some memberships to the marketplace to perform more strongly in the current year and going forward. So all of those elements that you would imagine, we have to do and we have to execute well on. And as we do, we will position ourselves for an even stronger performance position for 2015 because all those things we talked about are structural in nature. And then beyond that, we see growth opportunities that come on to a much higher, a much more rigorous platform. That is, in essence, the elements of the plan. We will be laying those kinds of things out in the investor conference. And to the first part of your question is we put out a range that has a -- acknowledges an upside to where we are today, as well as a downside, because I think we have a responsibility to acknowledge the headwinds that are in the marketplace. The notion that we are putting out a range that has an upside to it, we think, is completely aligned and consistent with the conversation we had last quarter. We are focused on growing earnings of this enterprise. It will be difficult in 2014. We've said that before. But beyond that, we think the things that we're going to do are going to improve and strengthen our business going forward. And we have very strong businesses and growth opportunities in Optum, and we haven't even touched on international. So that's why I think we do take a positive attitude about where we are. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Borsch: Just one question on the Medicaid business. You touched on the headwind from the industry fee there. I think, though, when we had visited you guys a couple of months ago, Jack, you, in particular, had highlighted that, unless I misunderstood, that the Medicaid businesses, on an overall basis, you expected earnings to grow in 2014. I'm just -- I'm trying to match that up with the size of the headwind that you might be facing. And maybe some of it is just going to be timing because the rates will catch up, but how do you get there with the industry fee not reflected in many of the rates? \nStephen Hemsley: Well, I think we can go back to Steve Nelson's comments, but I think what he was offering in his discussion about overall rate advocacy is whether you can pinpoint that element in the rate response from the states. We are getting rates that would suggest that we have opportunity for growth in 2014. So I would have said that, to me, was one of the more positive elements in terms of his commentary. So I think we are getting that kind of overall rate relief. Steve, is that correct? \nSteve Nelson: Absolutely. There's not only, within that, a positive view and the opportunity to grow earnings, but tremendous membership growth as well. And that will come from a lot of sources, but our geographic footprint is really strong. We're in states that we've developed great partnerships with, and we're bringing innovations and capability and have demonstrated competitiveness with recent wins. And so I think there's a lot of opportunity. We feel pretty positive about the -- in that business. \nMatthew Borsch: Great. That was an important clarification. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Tom Carroll with Stifel. \nThomas Carroll: So a question on the mix shift that you're highlighting with the sizable fee-based growth this quarter, as well as last quarter, I believe, you commented on it. But looking year-over-year at the change in your operating cost number, as well as your cost of products sold number, those 2 things together are up about $700 million year-over-year. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of that increase is attributable to the fee-based growth, and should we think about kind of a higher level of operating cost going forward? \nStephen Hemsley: Maybe Dave Wichmann would be best to cover this. But when we talk about operating cost relative to that, we're talking about services. So we're talking about the difference between insurance premiums versus services. There are some services in UnitedHealthcare, but the big pieces of services are Optum. Virtually all of Optum's businesses fall into that category. And a significant portion of Amil, as well, because Amil has those significant care delivery services. All of those elements contribute to that. So those are the elements that are growing very rapidly and are outgrowing our premium-based arrangements and creating the higher proportion of operating cost versus medical cost because medical costs only come through on risk-based products. Dave? \nDavid Wichmann: Yes, so a couple of things. First, I think, specifically to the lines you're looking at, if you look at our services growth year-over-year, it's 25%. And if you look at our products growth year-over-year, it's 19%. And those 2 things are disproportionally pushing our operating costs up, which are up about 14% year-over-year, and our cost of products sold, which are up about 17%. So you can see, just by the very nature of those few line items, that there is a significant influence there. But maybe in the context of the operating cost ratio being up 20 basis points quarter-to-quarter, I could demonstrate this more fully. The single largest driver of that increase has been and in this quarter, it's no exception, continues to be mixed business exchanges. And most are the things that Steve just laid out. We had a large funding conversion this year, as you recall, in the first quarter. That, of course, reduces our revenue side. We have Amil included, and Amil has a higher operating cost ratio in the business. We brought on TRICARE, which is a significant fee-based arrangement. And of course, the results at Optum are eye-popping in terms of the growth, and that's largely services-based business. That, again, is the dominant component of that. But in addition to that, we have been implementing ICD-10, PPACA, implementing TRICARE and reimplementing it, unfortunately, this year as well, but also this PBM migration as well. So again, a large contributor to the operating cost ratio this year. I'll tell you, these are significantly offset by the productivity advances of this team, very significantly offset. I'd say our productivity is not only at the upper end of the range we typically have given you, but it's an additional 50% more. So very, very strong results this year in terms of the way we've managed that. So in general, we're very pleased with our operating cost results and the progress we've made in containing them, and that's something that we're committed to doing into the future as well. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush. \nSarah James: Can you speak to how you're thinking about public exchange accounting? Specifically, can you reasonably accrue for these 3 Rs? And there has been some talk of a plan-initiated data share program to aid on understanding market average risk scores if  CMS doesn't provide it until '15. So is this something that United is considering participating in? And how valid is the insight from this group, meaning how much of the exchange market may be participating in the data share? \nStephen Hemsley: Dan, do you want to take care of that? \nDaniel Schumacher: With respect to risk adjustment, I think it's important to recognize that it's not something that's unfamiliar to us. We've got a couple of our large states and very successful states where we have modified forms of risk adjustment today. And also, we operate in Medicare Advantage, which, as you know, has a big risk adjustment to it as well. To your point, we have absolutely participated with a third party to gather industry information and get some feedback on where we sit. And based on that information, as well as our past experience, we feel very comfortable with our ability to estimate the results as we get into 2014. And the other thing that I think is important is our size and geographic diversity is another thing that plays in our favor with respect to risk adjustment. \nSarah James: It sounded like you have already participated with this third party on sharing information. So is there enough out there to kind of tell what the average health of the exchange is? Is that more costly or sick? \nDaniel Schumacher: Yes, we've participated in 2 cycles of that right now. And we will again, in the first quarter, participate in another cycle of that. And they're endeavoring to get 75% of the market participants at a local level, segmented by small group and individual. So we'll be able to -- based on that information, we think we've got a good sense of it. And also, again, our size and geographic diversity are things that will be important to us. \nSarah James: Is there any comparison you can offer to your traditional commercial book, how much more sick these people are? \nStephen Hemsley: So I think we might be getting a little muddled in this because I think you might be asking about does this give us insight into what we think the public exchange mix looks like. And I don't really think we're going to get -- we really don't have an experience with that, and I don't think it is our place to comment on that. I think Dan was commenting that the size, diversity and geographic spread of our book gives us a perspective of being kind of very average across the nation. We're a good proxy for a national platform. Is that right, Dan? \nDaniel Schumacher: That's right. And Sarah, this obviously relates to both on and off exchanges business in small group and individual. It's really -- that's the reference around our size and scale, not our exchange participation, which, as we've said before, is modest initially. \nStephen Hemsley: Okay. So I'm sure we'll be talking and touching more about that at the investor conference as well. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citigroup. \nCarl McDonald: I wanted to focus on the OptumHealth business earnings, up roughly 90% this year, and that's come mainly from margins running 300 basis points above your expectations. So just the 2 related questions there. What's driving the margin expansion within OptumHealth? And do you think a 10% margin is sustainable, or should we look, going forward, for that margin to return to more historical levels? \nStephen Hemsley: Larry and John, do you want to touch that? \nJohn Penshorn: Before we start, Carl, can you clarify, are you asking about OptumHealth? Sorry, this is John Penshorn. Are you asking about OptumHealth or Optum overall? I don't follow your question. \nCarl McDonald: OptumHealth, specifically. \nLarry Renfro: So Carl, it's Larry Renfro. Let me make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to ask John Rex to jump in on this. When we look at Optum, we look at the 3, what I'll call, the 3 organizations, and we have a margin range of each one of them. And OptumHealth is 8% to 10%, and OptumInsight is 15% to 19%, and OptumRx is 3% to 4%. And we try to manage this throughout the year. And I realize that we had a very good quarter in the third quarter. But I would say that over the 12-month period, based on mix, seasonality and investments that we're making, that we still believe that, that range in Optum -- in OptumHealth is going to be in that 8% to 10% range. So we don't see anything that's changing that. I think Steve commented that overall, and I'll just say this, that we believe that this year, we'll finish at 6%, which was one of the goals that we have set for 2015 for Optum overall. But maybe I'll ask John to comment on this in more detail. \nJohn Rex: Yes. So if we look at, in particular -- so first of all, I'd comment that when I look at OptumHealth and the performance 9 months to date, and actually I'd kind of broaden it a little bit and talk about Insight and Rx also within that context, that when I look at the 9 months, we're within the range of those long-term guidance ranges we gave you. So 9 months to date, within OptumHealth and OptumInsight, we're running at the high end of those ranges. And within OptumRx, we're running just about in the middle of that range. And that would be our expectation going forward. I mean, I think quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, we see impacts from mix, seasonality and investments that we'll be making in the businesses. So that's why we stick with those long-term ranges that we've set out. If I would think about OptumHealth particular in terms of the 3Q and some of the highlights, I'd say the entire portfolio of businesses within OptumHealth were performing well, but I'd maybe point out local care delivery, our population health and our health-related financial services businesses as all strong contributors. But again, very much speaking with that long-term range that we've laid out for these business, as we will continue to invest. \nStephen Hemsley: And I think in total, if you look at Optum as an emerging enterprise, that there's scale opportunities there that are meaningful. And I think when we talk about things like One Optum and so forth, that's what we're really talking about is that we have opportunities to, we think, continue to improve the performance and yield of that business. \nOperator: We go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen. \nChristine Arnold: Following up on Optum. I'm hearing a couple of things I just wanted to clarify. I'm hearing that we're within the long-term range of margins that we expect, which suggests that margins will be -- probably not move much next year relative to this year. But I'm also hearing it's an emerging enterprise with scale opportunities. Scale opportunities suggests to me kind of margin improvement opportunities. So can Optum grow earnings at the same pace in '14 as they did in '13? How do I think about that? \nStephen Hemsley: So let's go back to the very first question of the call. This is, again, more triangulation around '14 that we would really prefer to save for the investor conference and can then actually present those things in a coherent and kind of fulsome basis, see all of the offerings across the enterprise, their relative challenges and their relative opportunities. There are clearly opportunities in Optum. We are clearly looking to improve its performance, grow its earnings, improve its margins, but we're not going to comment specifically on '14 until the investor conference. \nChristine Arnold: Okay. Well, then, taking a different question, then. If we look at Amil, can you talk to how that's performing? And is this an investment year? How do I think about this year's Amil performance relative to kind of future opportunity? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Well, I think we have great growth aspirations for Amil, and I think it's performing on or above its plan. But Dave, do you want to talk... \nDavid Wichmann: Yes, Christine, Dave Wichmann. For the first 9 months of this year, Amil is ahead of its financial plan, both in terms of growth and profitability. So obviously, we're quite pleased. I think the economy in Brazil is shaping up to our expectations, so it provides a nice platform, if you will, for growth. We are seeing that growth in the business, both in terms of our membership growth on medical lives, which are up about 365,000 since we started, and then also in the general marketplace as well, which are up about 400,000 lives since we commenced just under a year ago. I think that growth is really the great assessment of the strength of Amil's offerings and the value of its -- what I'll call semi-integrated delivery model and its ability to offer higher-quality, as well as cost-effective, products in the marketplace. This quarter, we're experiencing winter, so it's kind of counter-seasonal for what we see here in the United States. So as expected, earnings are off related to seasonality relative to our overall expectation. Just on the integration front, it's going very well. I'd just point out 2 things. One is we're really working with Amil to, I'd say, bring a more modern technology and operating infrastructure to that marketplace, which, I think, is a great opportunity for us to distinguish ourselves in the market around service, quality and whatnot in addition to the clinical quality aspects of the model that they offer. And likewise, we are -- they are, in turn, helping us with ideas around clinical care delivery and how that integrates in local markets and drives the peer performance on behalf of the consumers we serve. So overall, you should take away from all that, that we're quite pleased to date with our Amil relationship. \nOperator: We'll go to Michael Baker with Raymond James. \nMichael Baker: Just a question on OptumRx. Given the fact that you're at the tail end of the Medco integration here, I was wondering if there are any plans to differentiate your specialty pharmacy management offering, given your unique positioning in the marketplace. \nJack Larsen: Yes, sure. Well, we have a couple of philosophies on specialty. And the first one is we really focus on adherence because adherence for these very sick patients provides lower medical cost for our customers. The second thing is we want to eliminate drug waste, so we do a lot of work with respect to making sure that we take lab values and the like, make sure the treatments are working. And the last thing I think we're doing from a specialty standpoint is we have great visibility into the medical benefits, so we can see and manage about half the spend that resides there. \nOperator: And we'll go last to Steve Halper [ph] with FBR. \nUnknown Analyst: Just looking at Insight, OptumInsight. Over the last few years, you've been focused on Optum One and focusing on certain business lines. How is that progressing in terms of achieving the overall efficiencies, as well as what were the stronger performers within Insight during the quarter? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Larry, you want to kick that off, and then Bill? \nLarry Renfro: Yes, and I'll kick it over to Bill. The overall One Optum plan, and I think you said this, had in it for 2013 that we were pivoting to growth. And pivoting to growth, what we had talked about doing was really being able to position ourselves to attract what I -- and I said this earlier, a larger, deeper and more complex relationship. And the Optum360, the Dignity deal, is a good example. That is part of OptumInsight, and Bill can talk a little bit about that. I can tell you that, as we go down the road here, the pipeline is very strong. We think we're well positioned in the marketplace. And I think that you're going to see more and more of these larger organizations that are going to be part of what I'll call planned investments that we have to put in place as we still have to -- we really have to develop and innovate as we become more of a potent solutions-oriented organization. So we're positioning, for the future, a lot in the OptumInsight area. So, Bill? \nBill Miller: Yes, I think we continue to see, specifically, our compliance offerings expand. A lot of the work that we're doing with payers around payment integrity and, to Larry's point, our provider businesses, as we continue to create depth with them and, really, the One Optum strategy coming together to really give more end-to-end oriented solutions is being, I think, very warmly received by the industry. The latest example of that is the Optum360 relationship with Dignity. And I think we're seeing a continued demand for us to be more end-to-end in our approaches, and that has been the intent of the One Optum thought and our product integration and our business integrations. And I think we're reaping the rewards for that. \nStephen Hemsley: So I think that's it. Let me just briefly finish by thanking you again for joining us this morning, your interest and participation. I think we had a very solid third quarter in the context of a very strong 2013. We think we have meaningful performance opportunities in front of us. We are focused on optimizing the performance of this enterprise and addressing the headwinds of 2014. We will look forward to sharing more detail with you and insight at the investor conference on December 3. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning to review our first half 2013 and the longer-term future we continue to build at UnitedHealth Group. The performance of the quarter and the first half of this year reflect many of the themes we are focusing on with intensity across UnitedHealth Group: growing by serving more people with higher and more consistent quality with compassion and a better, more modern and personal consumer experience; making health care more affordable by enabling the health care consumer, the care provider and the system itself to become a more effective system of health and wellness; advancing the performance and value of this enterprise for shareholders through operating and capital disciplines in both growth and strategic diversification, as well as dividend and share recapture. We see several of these elements in our first half performance in a number of ways such as the consistent, broad-based growth across each of our market-facing business groups; medical cost trends that have remained in check and will help to keep health benefits affordable; the increasing pace in product innovation and adoption as nearly 6 million consumers now embrace our incentive product design and our rapidly growing portfolio of consumer tools; the rapid acceleration of deeper and more integrated performance-based payment relationships with care providers that will reach above 25 billion by this year end; and the increase in our dividend to more than $1 billion annually even as we sustain $3 billion in share buyback. We have a great deal more to do. We are far from performing to our potential. Although we are seeing steady advancements on many fronts, we are redoubling our commitment to consistent execution in the core fundamentals of our businesses. We are determined to accelerate the pace of innovation and the adoption of simpler and more modern approaches and technologies and ever better approaches consistently delivering higher-quality care and access and to make health care more understandable and affordable for both the individual consumer and for our society. Our performance in the first half of 2013 was characterized by this growing business momentum, continued service expansion and diversification across the enterprise. In the second quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.40 per share, up 10% year-over-year with revenues over $30.4 billion, up 11.5% year-over-year. As expected, the consolidated operating margin decreased slightly year-over-year by 30 basis points as the consolidated medical care ratio increased to 20 basis points to 81.5%, reflecting our continued strong growth and diversification into government benefit programs. And accelerating growth from our services, international and fee-based businesses produced a 90 basis point rise in the consolidated operating cost ratio to 15.9%. The level of services growth has become so meaningful that it continues to outstrip steady efficiency gains from our multi-year initiatives enhancing quality, simplicity and system-wide productivity, as well as our concentrated focus on cost management across UnitedHealthcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group. While this ratio has increased, it remains largely a reflection of the ongoing growth and diversification across UnitedHealth Group. Cash flows from operations were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $2.5 billion through 6 months. We decreased our debt-to-total capital ratio by 160 basis points during the quarter to 34.6% at June 30 and ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in available cash. Last month, our board increased our dividend by 32% to an annual rate of $1.12 per share and renewed our share repurchase program with a fresh authorization for the repurchase of 110 million shares. These decisions reflect confidence in the strength and consistency of our underlying earnings and cash generation capacities into the future. In the current quarter, UnitedHealth Group continued its pattern of steady, consistent growth and market share gains, and we see more growth to come in the next few years in areas such as commercial and consumer benefits through public and private exchanges, Medicare Advantage, state Medicaid expansions, Medicaid long-term care, dual-eligible MMEs, military and veteran benefits and services, the emerging Brazilian market and the continuing maturation of Optum's broad range of services for consumers, care providers, payers and other participants in the health system as a whole. Let's review second quarter business results, starting with UnitedHealthcare where the story remains one of remarkable growth and continued market share gains. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has been the fastest-growing health benefits company, increasing the number of people served by more than 9 million. This includes more than 2.9 million people in TRICARE and another 4.7 million people from Amil in Brazil, both new markets for us. Overall growth has been driven by offering distinct and innovative consumer benefits and services shaped to respond to local market needs and affordable price points for consumers. UnitedHealthcare has designed a comprehensive system of capability that aligns modern, incentive-based benefit designs with easy and convenient consumer empowerment tools that engage effective clinical care wellness programs, which in turn channel naturally into incentivized, performance-based care delivery access. This aligned system leverages better informed and incentive consumer and care provider behaviors to produce sustainable cost and performance advantages and deeper, more innovative relationships with consumers, care providers and plan sponsors across all market segments. Effective incentive alignment with consumer benefits through the care provider rewards is a critical component to sustainably improving broader accountability and effective payer to care provider integration. We are the market leaders in consumer value plans with nearly $6 million high deductible or consumer incentive plans in force. We are leaders in consumer transparency tools with innovative mobile applications that enable effective use of information specific to each consumer. We're further along in value-based care provider contracting than any other company and our pace is accelerating with more than $50 billion in accountable care performance contracts expected by 2017, if not sooner. These programs offer varying levels of integration with care providers, depending on their ability to affect health outcomes and assume financial risk. Year-by-year, these programs are helping transform how health care is delivered, paid for and rewarded. This quarter, UnitedHealthcare's organic growth was led by the initiation of services for TRICARE in the West region for 2.9 million members in the military and their families. This is the first time this contract has moved to a new service provider in more than 15 years and we encountered challenges as we engaged in this complex and massive transition. We have learned from these initial challenges and regret any disruption this may have caused to men and women we are privileged to serve, and we're deeply grateful for the collaborative working relationship with the Department of Defense, the TRICARE Management Activity, the TRICARE Regional Office West and the surgeon generals of the respective services, the military treatment facilities and their fine leaders. Having quickly advanced from these initial challenges, we remain committed to consistent excellent service and the value of innovation in going forward for these programs. UnitedHealthcare's Employer & Individual business added a net 235,000 people year-to-date and is performing strongly across-the-board. Growth continues to be strong across the government benefit markets as well. Through the first half of the year, UnitedHealthcare remains the largest, and once again, fastest-growing Medicare Advantage participant. And Part D and Medicare Supplement both continued to perform strongly. Medicare Advantage products have grown to serve 355,000 more people through the first 6 months, and our full array of Medicare product offerings has grown to serve over 1 million more seniors this year. Medicaid growth stands at 110,000 people through the first 6 months despite a divestiture impacting 60,000 people earlier this year. Care for chronic and complex populations remains a distinctive capability for this business and a major forward growth driver with recent awards to serve long-term care and dual-eligible beneficiaries in Arizona, Florida, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Washington State. For the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare generated operating earnings of $1.9 billion with solid contributions from all businesses. The commercial medical care ratio improved 10 basis points year-over-year. We are performing slightly better on outpatient costs despite the continued migration of clinical services from inpatient settings. We continue to experience lower hospital inpatient usage as we expected, and inpatient costs are in line with our projections. Overall, 2013 full year commercial cost trends are tracking in line with our initial projections of 5% to 6% with unit prices remaining a core driver of increases. UnitedHealthcare's results include Amil, which is now 90% owned. With Amil, our international business has grown to serve 260,000 more consumers in the first half of the year, remain solidly ahead of its growth and financial plans for the year and is well-positioned to continued growth and market share gains, driven by its distinctive market offerings and clinical engagement model. We continue to be gratified by the growing response to Optum's market-leading offerings and capabilities. Each of Optum's businesses posted double-digit top line gains. And overall, Optum revenue rose 21% over last year. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 6.1% despite the increasing mix of pharmacy services revenues. As of today, we are more than halfway through our pharmacy migration. And since January 1, OptumRx serves a total of about 8 million new consumers, including these migrations and new business. For the first 6 months of the year, total Optum operating earnings rose 80% to just over $1 billion. Optum's strong first half 2013 performance is proving that the broader health system and its constituencies create a natural end market for services, a market we have sized at more than $500 billion annually. Historically, this market has been fragmented and served primarily by smaller single-point solutions. We see the opportunity to bring together the services and capabilities we offer and provide broader, more integrated solutions to larger, more diverse clients while continuing to deliver even more effective stand-alone products and services to our traditional customer base. We are focusing our investments on roughly 10 product families and freeing up resources through this more disciplined focus and the related productivity gain to fund further development and innovation on behalf of the clients and consumers we serve. These actions are driving stronger and more consistent margin performance across all Optum's businesses. The collective performance of our diverse UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses ultimately comes through in UnitedHealth Group's strong overall results. As we indicated earlier in our commentary, UnitedHealth Group consolidated revenues grew 11.5% and net earnings grew 10% to $1.40 per share in the second quarter. We expect full year 2013 net earnings in the tighter range of $5.35 to $5.50 per share. Our second half earnings performance will benefit from the timing of Part D earnings and contributions and Optum's continued performance gains. Our balance sheet is strong and our cash flows from operations are expected in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion this year. We already targeted returning up to $4 billion of that to shareholders, and our recent dividend increase now puts us in an annual dividend payment pace of more than $1 billion. Looking forward, our outlook remains consistent, strongly positive in the long term with familiar near-term challenges coming in 2014 and 2015 as we indicated last quarter. We expect pressure on the pace of revenue growth next year, given both rate and membership pressures in Medicare Advantage. We see further business and product integration advances, further medical affordability gains and intense focus on driving lower operating costs to improve and sustain our competitive positions serving key health benefit markets and continuing strong cash flows. The next phases of the Affordable Care Act should bring growth and expansion in the Medicaid business, as well as to Optum and some meaningful financial challenges as well. For instance, on the Medicare side, the challenge is intensified meaningfully and include nondeductible taxes combined with the continued significant underfunding of Medicare Advantage. We remain committed to Medicare Advantage as the most valuable and fastest-growing Medicare benefit offering available to American seniors. By 2016, Medicare Advantage will, in effect, be reimbursed at parity with original Fee-for-Service Medicare. And at the same time, it will continue to deliver better benefits at lower costs because of effective medical cost management and far better consumer-focused services and technologies, none of which are present in the current Medicare Fee-for-Service system. 2016 should represent a final baseline pivot for Medicare growth for years to come, and America's demographic trends are compelling. Well more than 3 million people will enter Medicare each year, and UnitedHealth Group is uniquely positioned to emerge as the market leader. These long-term growth trends informed our approach to our 2014 Medicare bids, which will remain under review by CMS through the summer. Our decisions for 2014 focus on balancing program sustainability, margin protection and cash flow generation of our MA business measured on a long-term multi-year basis. We are aggressively and consistently addressing the operating and marketing costs of our Medicare programs without compromising the exceptional support and services we offer to the seniors we are serving through these important benefits. The depth of the underfunding of these benefits to seniors is causing us to exit certain market areas, reduce the number of plan offerings and reduce benefits in the majority of the local markets we serve commensurate with our review of the competitive position and long-term sustainability of our services for each individual market. We are shaping our networks to ensure we are delivering health care with local care provider partners who deliver high-quality care and provide a sustainably low medical cost structure and to increasingly share in the results of collaborative efforts to bring greater quality and consistency of care to seniors, including the most elderly and those with chronic conditions. These steps can be expected to moderate member growth in 2014 in contrast to our strong growth experience over the last few years. We will engage our members further by increasing our use of in-home health reviews and in-home services. Even with these actions, we expect pressure on 2014 Medicare Advantage margins. The severe underfunding of the MA program for 2014, combined with the ACA tax impact and continued sequestration effects are too significant a burden to ask seniors to bear alone and still expect this important franchise to remain attractive to them. Beyond Medicare Advantage and some remaining unknowns focused around ACA implementation in the individual and small group markets, we expect the general narrative of UnitedHealth Group's performance for 2014 to be largely the same as 2013. Our commercial benefits, international, Medicaid and military businesses should all continue to perform well. Optum will continue to grow strongly and contribute comparatively more of our overall performance as virtually every Optum business and product line is growing and performing well and is expected to continue on that path. We will continue to be good stewards of shareholder capital, continuing to balance investments across our businesses and returning more capital to shareholders in both dividends and share repurchase. From 1999 through the end of 2013, we have returned more than $40 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase even as we have grown and enriched the capabilities, the market positions, the value and the forward potential of this enterprise. We remain optimistic about our capacity to serve society and to create value for the people and customers we serve as well as for the health system at large. And we look forward to an expanding discussion of our strategy, growth and performance at our investor conference, which this year will be on December 3 in New York. As usual, this morning, we have a full complement of leaders here and would ask the operator to open the call to our questions. Only one per speaker, please. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to just ask a little bit more about Medicare Advantage. You made a comment, if I heard it correctly, about final baseline EBIT in 2016 as a base for growth once we're fully at parity. Did I hear that correctly? And do you -- are you implying that EBIT is -- in Medicare Advantage is down from -- on a downward slope in '14 and '15 and then normalizing in '16 and growing from there?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, well, I'm glad you asked the question because I don't think that if it went out that way, that's not what our intent was. Basically, continued funding pressures, some of them mechanical, the impact of the ACA and so forth will continue basically to get the funding mechanisms for Medicare Advantage to be at parity with Fee-for-Service. Once that funding is leveled at that basis, the programs are thought to then be neutral to each other from that perspective. And therefore, one could expect, given the strong performance of the Medicare Advantage program, that the growth could even accelerate from that point because you've got this significant demographic trend. You have a very attractive program, and the Medicare Advantage program will still have meaningful advantages in terms of benefits, medical management capacities, consumer engagement and relationship capacities that the Fee-for-Service system simply doesn't have right now. So that's why I think our outlook on Medicare Advantage in the long term is so positive because, in essence, we have to navigate through these next couple of years where some of the mechanical funding actions will take place. But even in those periods and those have been, in my view, in effect, Medicare Advantage has continued as a broad national program to prosper and grow. So I don't know how it will play out in 2014 and '15 as these elements play in on the funding -- to get funding in essence to neutrality. But from 2016 forward, that neutrality should then baseline this program and it will be Medicare Advantage with its, I think, compelling advantages compared to the Fee-for-Service system. And we think the prospects for growth after that are quite compelling. That's really what we tried to get across.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, that makes sense. You also characterized, in terms of next year, that the impact would be to moderate member growth for 2014. Do you imply by that, that you do expect growth but it's just at a slower rate?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Well, we really didn't comment on that direction. What we were intending to say is actions that we are taking to make sure that program is competitive and viable in as many markets as we can possibly continue to advance in. So along those lines, we outlined a series of steps that we're taking that maybe Jack Larsen wants to count on that. But again, we are focused on operating that program to its maximum potential in serving as many American seniors as we can through that program and making sure that it continues to perform in terms of growth, margin protection, cash flow attributes, et cetera, and to maximize the performance of the program, recognizing the funding pressure that's on and recognizing that there might be limitations to how much seniors can actually bear the underfunding actions that are being taken with respect to the program. Jack?\nJack Larsen: Thanks, Steve. I would just add maybe a bit of an exclamation point on some of the changes that we're contemplating for our business next year and I think Steve went through them well. We're looking at benefits. We're going to be adjusting our -- planning some market withdrawals, I think, at a more modest end, perhaps 5% or so, with most of those members having an opportunity to enroll in another UnitedHealthcare plan. We'll be narrowing our networks consistent with achieving better cost, better outcomes and better management of our stores [ph]. And Matt, we haven't really seen how our competitors are taking to all these, too. So I would say, at this distance, I think the only thing we can really say is that our performance at the membership growth line is likely to be more moderate compared to the last couple 2 or 3 years where we have grown very well.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Justin Lake with JP Morgan.\nJustin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First, just wanted to check and see if there's any updated view you can share with us on 2014 EPS growth overall.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Well, Justin, we thought that question might come up. We don't really comment on next year's guidance in the current midyear quarter. I would say that with that said, earnings growth is clearly our focus for 2014 and we are intense about that. But we have to recognize that there is a great deal in front of us to achieve that. As we just mentioned, certainly strengthening Medicare Advantage given the significant 2014 funding shortfall and the steps we need to take to make sure that program continues to be vital is on the front of the list of that. There's also ongoing work in the commercial markets, with pressures on our own individual business, the continued market migration to lower price point insurance products and fee-based conversions. And those are all occurring kind of in the backdrop of a normal competitive dynamics intention. We remain respectful of medical cost trends despite the success in keeping trends in check, and particularly, given the measured economic recovery. We need to make continued investments in Optum in the emerging categories of private exchanges, Medicare risk and revenue cycle, house calls, ever larger and longer-term care provider relationships, Optum cloud products, and in general, we are committed to continuing to fund ongoing innovation and adoption. And then last, we want to think about headwinds. Investment income, we'll see probably short-term pressure as current portfolios actually turn over and transition from kind of capital gain realization mode into higher-yielding portfolios for the longer term. So with that series of headwinds in front of us, experience has taught us to be somewhat cautious and to be sure we consider and respond to these headwinds before we offer a sense of 2014. So we are not prepared to do that, but I would say we are intensely focused on solid earnings growth for 2014. But we have to work our way through that as we stand really in the mid-year of '13.\nJustin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then my actual question was more of just a follow-up on Medicare Advantage. Just to make sure I'm clear on what you've laid out here is you felt like 2014 and '15 are looking like a -- obviously, you're going to be under pressure. But by the end of 2015 going into '16, do you expect that '16 growth to reaccelerate and you feel like you'll still, after all this pressure, given what you're doing from a cost perspective and managing, you're going to have -- and you feel like the benefits that you still have left out there for seniors after these costs will still be enticing and you expect growth to be in line with what you've seen over the last couple of years and potentially even accelerate? Was that a right -- was that the correct takeaway?\nStephen J. Hemsley: I think you generally have it correct. I think you may have a more precise notion of it than we would having to operate the program. So I can't tell you that on January 1, 2016, that there will be some kind of a light will go on, et cetera. But you have exactly the direction of our thinking on this program correctly. That as we navigate through the next couple of years and the pressures that, I think, are well acknowledged on the program, we intend to operate it in a -- in such a way that we are maintaining the vitality of that program, protecting its margins, maintaining the vitality of its benefits and its distinctions to consumers, to seniors that need these programs and that we think that, as you reach that point of neutrality, which is about 2016, that the growth dynamics of that should accelerate, yes.\nJustin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And so do you see the program will be bigger than it is today or not -- or smaller than it is given the -- given what's facing you when you get to 2016? And that's it for me.\nStephen J. Hemsley: That's the third installment of your single question. Obviously, Justin, from that discussion, we expect in the long term that the needs of the American seniors and what the values we can bring to the Medicare program suggest that is a very strong long-term growth platform.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.\nChristian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just want to follow up on Medicare Advantage again and make sure. I understand what you're talking about in terms of reimbursement and the pressures in '14 and '15. But when we think about the business near term, particularly fourth quarter this year and how you market to seniors, will you take your foot off the accelerator somewhat in terms of marketing, or do you think you have to accelerate the spending this year to maintain what you have and potentially grow? And just if you could give us any context on how the suspending might change year-to-year, that would be helpful.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, I might offer -- take it at my level that how we're going to approach and deploy resources to the market from a marketing point of view at this point in time is really a little, I would say, a level of competitive intimacy that I'd rather not share. I would say that our commentary was more along the lines of the fact that we are going to be shaping networks to be more focused, to really focus on the high-performance assets as it relates to seniors, that the benefit reductions that are fairly broad based, those are the elements that I think will play into more conservative growth prospects for '14. I think that getting into what our marketing plan is, might be a little bit more than we would like to get into this morning.\nOperator: And we'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nAlbert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Maybe I'll switch gears a little bit. There's been some developments, obviously, around the ACA since we last had you guys on the conference call, the employer mandate delays, some documentation delays and then we've also gotten some information on the exchanges in some states. I know you said you'd be opportunistic, particularly around the exchanges. Can you comment about, A, does any of those developments that have occurred in the last few months change your perspective on those opportunities that are available to you maybe looking out next year and beyond for the ACA?\nStephen J. Hemsley: I think I'll have Gail and Jeff Alter kind of comment on that. I would just say, again, like to calibrate the perspective we're bringing to it. Long term, we're positive with respect to those channels as they form and as they became areas where we think we can participate and add value. The near-term dynamics are more challenging for us and maybe that's specific to our particular profile of business. So near term, we have tended to be more cautious with respect to those, and I think generally, the elements that have been occurring reinforce those tendencies.\nGail Koziara Boudreaux: Good morning. It's Gail Boudreaux. I think Steve hit on the core principles. We've been, I think, modest in our participation in the exchanges. But I think the biggest story, quite frankly, is there is significant change going on across the overall commercial markets. So as we think about our business, we're focused both inside and outside of the exchange around affordable benefit offerings for our consumers. So what we're talking about in terms of our network and our intentional integration of product, clinical and network strategies is really core to both what we're doing inside and out of the exchange. We're participating in about a dozen exchanges as you can see from what's been publicly disclosed. And quite frankly, at this stage of the game, we've kept a very disciplined process around that. We think that there is a huge opportunity over the long term, and we're going to participate to learn in those exchanges. In terms of what's happened on the overall reform implementation, at this stage, we're preparing our business. And as I said, much of what we're doing, we're doing for both inside and outside of the exchange because we think affordability and consumer engagement are probably the most critical pieces.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I just wanted to understand a little better this year's guidance. You guys reported a quarter, which beat at least consensus numbers by $0.15. But it looks like you're only raising guidance by $0.05 at the mid-point. So wanted to understand a little bit how you thought about guidance. Is there anything that you thought of, in the back half of the year, that might be a headwind that maybe you weren't anticipating before, that maybe the market wasn't anticipating?\nStephen J. Hemsley: I don't think so, and I might have Dave comment on that. But in essence, we tend to operate within a range and feel comfortable in that range. I think excessive precision here is -- time has taught us to be careful about that and to, in essence, be prudent with respect to the guidance that's offered. I would say that the performance of the business has been strong through the first half and while there is -- the orientation of the business was more challenging to the second half, we are pretty much on course and had -- saw no reason to do anything other than tighten again the range of guidance.\nDavid S. Wichmann: Right. So Kevin, it's David. If you kind of parse through this, the range of $5.35 to $5.50 per share suggests that the second half of the year will not only be stronger than the first half of this year, but also stronger than the comparative half year in 2012. And as we kind of commented on in the first quarter, that's largely due to the change in the seasonal pattern of Part D revenue and profit recognition. While -- Steve had it right, there's very modest pressure, additional pressure, on the back half of the year, I think we've already pointed some of these out. But just to keep in mind, obviously, the last half of the year has 2 quarters of the sequestration impact versus the first half of the year, we're only having one, as an example. And then, of course, as you also see, we have an uptick in a run rate of our growth patterns in the business as well. So that requires some investment, not only in terms of selling, but also in terms of implementation. And then Steve did mention the near-term impact on the higher interest rates than the impact that they have had on our ability to recognize the extensive capital gains that we have in the past. And then the last thing I'd just point out is our tax rate will return to 36.75% level for Qs 3 and 4, which will comparatively impact earnings in the last half of the year.\nKevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. But I guess, except for maybe higher interest rates, none of those sound necessarily new, like new headwinds per se?\nDavid S. Wichmann: No, I was just trying to give you some...\nStephen J. Hemsley: No, I just think we're just trying to establish a prudent, balanced, I think, consistent with what our posture has been for the last several years. And the businesses continue to perform well and Optum, in particular, is having a very, very strong year. But we didn't really see a need to change the guidance other than to tighten the range given the fact we only have a half year left.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.\nJoshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just taking a look at the SG&A changes. It came a little bit higher than what we were looking at. I think you were up 20 basis points. The ratio was up 20 bps in the first quarter and now up 90 in the second quarter and I see the TRICARE piece of it. But I'm just curious what's driving that? Was there sort of -- was there any discretionary spending, any acceleration of planned spending that you thought would be coming? And maybe within that, if you could just give us a baseline to start with the TRICARE revenue contribution, that'd be helpful.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Sure. Dave, you want to respond to that?\nDavid S. Wichmann: Sure. So the operating cost ratio is up 90 basis points year-over-year. It was very much in line with our expectations for this quarter. We mentioned in the script that there are several things contributing to that ratio, predominantly related to business mix changes. As you know, we had one large funding conversion from risk to fee in the first quarter. That obviously will continue to impact us throughout the year. We've also added Amil, which has a higher SG&A ratio. And obviously, we didn't have Amil in the second quarter last year. TRICARE, of course, fee-based contract as well as continuing costs of implementation through the second quarter, again not in place last year. And of course, Optum is growing very quickly, and of course, most of that business is service-oriented and fee-based as well. The only thing I'd point out beyond that, which is all in the script, really, is there's continued cost of implementation for CPCA [ph], ICD-10, the TRICARE implementation and the PBM migration. Those are all items that are inside our numbers for the second quarter and those, for the most part, associated with improved growth prospects for the business going forward. So we're pleased to make those investments. The last thing I'll just say is that, as indicated in the script, is that, obviously, all these things have offset what this management team has done over the past several years. But in particular, in the last year around cost containment efforts and done a very nice job advancing the productivity of the business and really muting the impact of this mix shift on this operating cost ratio.\nJoshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you. I was looking, Dave, more just 1Q increase versus 2Q increase. It looks like there was just sort of a pickup in the second quarter. I understand a lot of the implementation costs and the funding conversion, Amil and the implementation. I know a lot of that was impacting first quarter as well. So was just curious what caused the 70 basis point increase and sort of the year-over-year in 2Q and trying to figure out if TRICARE was big enough to do that, and my guess is that fee-based business probably wasn't big enough to cause that change.\nDavid S. Wichmann: Well, I don't think, if there's anything from our perspective that's out of line in there. I think it is the continued progression in mix. I think Optum continues to be a larger overall factor. And I'm not sure everybody can actually calculate the impact of that, but I think that is probably the largest contributing factor that the business -- that's all operating expenses and growing at a very solid rate. So I think it is, as we have analyzed, it is overwhelmingly mixed even the items in terms of regulatory and so forth, so basically in these numbers year-over-year and in them sequentially. So there is nothing in that, that we see out of line or outside our expectations or plans for the year other than probably an even higher level of performance on the part of our services business, which includes not just Optum, but also the fee -- the significant growth and continued fee-based businesses across UnitedHealthcare. That's where all their commercial growth has been.\nJohn S. Penshorn: Josh, it's John Penshorn. Last November, we said 15.9% plus or minus 30 basis points. That range we affirm and that accommodates the accelerated growth in fee-based services Steve referred to.\nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you go over for us how OptumRx growth is helping the firm exactly? And we can see it on OptumRx, but some of the improvement bleeds over into the commercial side of the business. What portion is on the commercial side of the business and what portion is on in OptumRx itself? And then can you talk about the growth path of Optum Rx in 2014 and 2015?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Sure. I'll have Dirk respond to that. I mean, it is perfectly in line with the OptumRx's agenda on synchronization and the impact it has extending to the total medicals costs. So Dirk, you want to...\nDirk McMahon: Yes, I think, well, let's start up by talking about the business. I think if you look, our RFP volume is up a bit year-over-year. And if you look at what we see, we don't see a lot of the business changing hands across the PBM space. But what we do see we're actually getting a little more than our fair share and our retention has been pretty good. So if you look at what we try to do, we try to, again, manage total health outcomes as well as our -- as well as improving the cost of care. And we do that, as it was with our synchronization approach, we bring all the data together and optimize the overall spend. So we think that, in addition to our specialty offering in the marketplace, is resonating very well.\nStephen J. Hemsley: So that bleeds to performance for UnitedHealthcare and its businesses, and obviously, for our government programs. So it does, we think, make us distinctive with respect to medical cost trends, with respect to that section of medical cost drugs as well as a growing and vital and more diversified PBM business that we think the potential, once this migration is fully digested and we can focus our full attentions to the external marketplace, I think the growth prospects of that can be quite impressive.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you quantify for us in any way how much of the improving MLR on the commercial side comes from bringing the Optum business in house?\nStephen J. Hemsley: I don't -- I think that we would be -- it would be too much of back-of-the-envelope kind of response. So we'll take that off-line and we'll kind of bring that kind of thing perhaps back in the next, in our next quarter. We'll comment specifically on the impact of that. I just don't want to shoot from the hip on something like that. So I think it's a very good question and I think we'll take it that way, if that's okay with you.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush.\nSarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: There is obviously a robust conversation going on with parties in D.C. around the sufficiency of 2014 Medicare rate and how that may influence 2015 budgets and rates. Can you give us a read on what you see as the current perception in D.C. of the adequacy of 2014 rate that, initially, it seems to like debut 2014 as more positive than you view it. So I wanted to see if the perception in D.C. has changed throughout your discussions with them. And if you could give us a read on the level of their receptivity compared to previous years to the information you're presenting on where rates should be going forward.\nStephen J. Hemsley: That is a -- that would be a challenging kind of conversation to have in a forum like this. I would say this in a very constructive way, that access to the administration, CMS administration, HHS and so forth has been -- has always been open and fair and constructive dialogue and conversation. They obviously pursue a variety of protocols in establishing the rate process. It is a complicated process. It's multi-faceted. So it's not really possible to have a single conversation about elements such as that. I think our positions with respect to the funding patterns on Medicare Advantage are well articulated and supported. And there is an open dialogue about that and that dialogue is occurring, in essence, all year long. So I do think it's an environment where the parties are working together. I think there is a recognition of the role that Medicare Advantage plays in the marketplace. And I would describe the conversations as very professional and productive. And I think we would have to leave it at that. It is not what I would characterize as some kind of contentious environment at all. These are extraordinarily professional people in the administration that are trying to administer these programs in accordance with the protocols that have been established into the best of their capacities. And we are having an ongoing business dialogue with them on this subject. So I think that's all we can really comment. And that happens in states as well, in Medicaid. It's just the nature of the market.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.\nRalph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: First, just wanted to make sure I heard correct that you're planning on exiting 5% of MA markets next year. And if possible, if that's correct, can you give us a sense of what percentage of MA enrollment that represents today? And then second, separately, just wondering, has the delay in employer mandate changed or would you expect it to change discussion at all with employers? I guess, it'd be helpful just to get a sense of how your discussions are going with employers. Is there more pushback? Is there confusion? Is there concern, et cetera? I'm just trying to get a broad sense of the appetite to make changes due to ACA near term.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Sure. Let's take Medicare first.\nJack Larsen: Hey, Ralph. Jack Larsen. So the 5% does relate to our membership. And I really wouldn't call them market excess -- market exits as much as planned withdrawals. So about 150,000 or so of our members will be impacted by member withdrawals. But in turn, about 80-plus percent of those members will have access to another UnitedHealthcare MA product.\nGail Koziara Boudreaux: Ralph, this is Gail Boudreaux. There are a number of questions, I think, embedded around the employer mandate. So let me address that one first and if I get to your issues... In terms of, first, the delay of the employer mandate, we don't really think that, that's going to have a significant impact. Employers who currently offer insurance are going to continue to do that and that's been the course of our discussions. In terms of how our discussions are going with employers, there is a lot of change coming to that marketplace and the intense focus is around affordability, as I said earlier, not just on the exchanges, but across all of our customers. They're looking at value-based plan designs, getting consumers much more engaged, how they integrate clinical programs. So I'd say the real focus is around affordability of coverage and improving consumer engagement and making sure they have real value for the dollars they spend.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.\nSheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: The MA discussion is remarkably more bullish than I thought it would be and maybe that's why your stock is trading up so nicely because it would suggest that 2014 may not be as challenged a year as one might have thought. So I guess, the first question is, is that -- the first part of the question -- is that the correct interpretation that now that you've gone through all this, you've reaffirmed your commitment to the program long term, post-2016, which I think was the point of that discussion, that you're able to find ways to mitigate the impact on both the beneficiary and the company of what is a dramatic underfunding of MA? And then the second question I have relates to capital deployment. Given that discussion about MA, can you either -- give us a sense of where you see the most attractive segments of your market or new opportunities, be they international or existing opportunities like Optum, like commercial, et cetera, where you think are the highest, best use of the capital that you're not already returning to shareholders.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Sure. First of all, very good observation, which I'd like to make sure we bring in-line. I think our view in terms of Medicare Advantage is really not different than we had indicated last quarter. We believe that program is severely underfunded for 2014. The comments that we're making, if you parse them are, that we are exiting certain markets, we're exiting certain plans, we're narrowing our networks across virtually all the markets, we are taking benefits down across all the markets. So those are not good things for American seniors who engage on these benefits. And those elements will clearly put pressure on both top line for 2014 on Medicare Advantage, an important program for us, and on the margins of that program. So to level set on that basis, that's I think what we said clearly. And we will work through those things. And we are absolutely intense on this program because we think it has a meaningful long-term value to American seniors and to basically the viability of the Medicare program, in total, going forward because it brings in market dynamics around the managing medical costs, around engaging consumers, around holding care providers accountable, elements such as that. That's a long -- that's placed to our competencies. It should be a strong, long-term market, so long as the program is funded appropriately. If it is not funded appropriately, then that -- those market dynamics will change. So I don't think anything has changed about that. We have just worked one more quarter through the tactics of how we will have to navigate through 2014. So to level set that, we are -- we see pressure in '14 and '15 on Medicare Advantage as a product. We're working through those. The program, in our view, has not been funded strongly in the past and '14 was very significant. It's a 750 basis point delta and what we see the cost of that program to be. In terms of allocating capital, we have a diversified model. And that strategy and diversification is a conscious one with the notion of allocating capital opportunistically across the spectrum of that diversified model. We see compelling opportunities and have in the Optum business. There are opportunities that will emerge, we think, in the benefits businesses. And we think that they will emerge over time as more pressure is brought into the overall health benefits marketplace. And we look for opportunities where we can deploy our 3 competencies around local care, market engagement, around information and around enabling technology in international settings. We found Brazil to be a compelling opportunity for that, particularly on our Optum services side. There's probably more market opportunities for us on the international side and we'll continue to look for benefits. But that is going to be probably more opportunistic because we don't see as many of those other than in Optum. I think Optum has a significant opportunity on the international side. We parse our investments based upon cost of capital return thresholds, along those lines, and recognize our responsibilities in terms of returning capital pursuant to dividends and share repurchase. So that's kind of the perspective and that really hasn't changed at all.\nSheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Right. So if I could just follow up then. If I'm going to interpret your 2014 comments, I think what I would say is beyond the challenges provided by MA, you see your capital deployment and all the other expertise that you bring to the table as providing the kind of balance perhaps to 2014, offsetting some of the negatives in MA would be the continued pace that you see in the rest of the businesses? And that the challenge in predicting 2014 for us is to balance the negative of the MA against the positives of the other business. The street is interpreting, I think, your comments as meaning flat 2014. And I'm trying to, from my perspective, I think you said balance one against the other, but you didn't commit to flat. Is that correct?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, we have committed to no position on 2014. I think beyond that, that what you're laying out is broadly the way I would -- broadly correct. And that is, we are positive about the other aspects of our business and our capabilities and we're applying them intensively to the pressure that is being put on the Medicare Advantage program that are still working through that. So we haven't declared on 2014. We are focused on growing earnings in 2014 and growing this business, that is our focus and our intensity every year. We have a lot to offer in terms of our diversified business model. And when we feel we have worked through this to the point where we can responsibly offer some direction to the marketplace, we will do that. But I think generally, you have the framework of it correct.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ana Gupte with Dowling & Partners.\nAna Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: So a lot of questions on 2014. I'm just trying to get a little more clarity on commercial and Medicare in 2013 as that's the baseline for all the headwinds that you will experience in '14. So on the Medicare side, in the first quarter, you had quite a bit of deterioration in your x commercial medical loss ratio. You brought up sequestration, enhanced Part D and some seasonal patterns of first quarter pressure and so on. It seems to have eased up in 2Q. I'm just trying to understand if it's because of Part D or you've actually done something to improve your base Medicare Advantage business and the potential margin deterioration that you've been experiencing, I think, in 1Q? Or is it prior period reserves or Amil or something else?\nStephen J. Hemsley: I think we'll have Dan comment on it. Clearly, Part D is a factor in it. But I think it's not the only one. So Dan?\nDaniel Schumacher: Sure. This is Dan. You have -- you had a lot in there. To Steve's point, absolutely, the biggest difference as you look sequentially, first quarter, second, both on a consolidated basis and in government programs and Medicare, obviously, is the Part D timing. In the first quarter, as you look year-over-year, it actually increased the loss ratio. And as you look at the second quarter, it actually decreased the loss ratio on a year-over-year basis. So that's the biggest swing item. But I'd also tell you inside of Medicare that we also have more favorable development than the first quarter and on a year-over-year basis and that's a little more concentrated in our Medicare business. And from the first to the second quarter in Medicare, we're seeing a little bit better performance on our new growth in Medicare. So those are some of the things that are influencing it with Part D being the most pronounced.\nAna Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: So your view of your own base Medicare business and if you can split out Medicare Advantage and Part D, do you expect deterioration from 2012 or not for the full year '13?\nDaniel Schumacher: On the full year, we expect our Medicare Advantage loss ratio to go up. Obviously, we have the significant reimbursement challenges as well as sequestration. And then working against that is our focus on clinical management and so forth. So -- but yes, in aggregate, we expect our Medicare Advantage loss ratio to increase on the full year. As you look at Part D, our performance is strong there. On the full year, our earnings will be up and they're up in large part due to the significant volume growth that we had in Part D. And obviously, the quarter-to-quarter progression is different. But in aggregate on the year, Part D earnings are going to be up.\nAna Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC: That's helpful. Then just the follow-up on the commercial side. You had a little bit of margin expansion in 1Q. You had cited the loss of a big, fully insured very high MLR count at the time. You're seeing a little bit of margin expansion in the second quarter. Your days and claims table have gone up by 1 day. All of you are on the hook for this tax for next year or so. Should we expect that either your reserves will strengthen or that your commercial underwriting spread gets better through 3 and 4Q as you build up for that tax burden?\nDaniel Schumacher: On the commercial side, yes, we had a decline in our loss ratio again this quarter on a year-over-year basis. We are down 10 basis points. A big portion of that is, obviously, the large case funding conversion that we had at the beginning of the year. And that's being offset by the competitive market environment. We guided at Investor Day to a more than 1 percentage point increase in our full year commercial loss ratio. We've adjusted for that large funding conversion. And we still expect at the mid-point, about a 60 basis point increase in our commercial loss ratio on the full year. So full year commercial loss ratio guidance still in that 81.2% plus or minus 50 basis points.\nStephen J. Hemsley: I think the question is really a baseline one. The commercial baseline for the current year is very solid, very strong. And it will then run into the challenges that you point out, that everybody will run into in the marketplace in '14 and '15.\nOperator: We'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citigroup.\nCarl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Can you roughly quantify the margin compression that you're expecting to see in Medicare Advantage next year? So roughly, are we talking 50 to 100 basis points or something bigger than that?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, well, first of all, we don't really get into margin at that level in the first place. And I think if I could do that at this point in time, we would have more to say about 2014. So that's what we're working through right now. And we have to work through them on a real basis through the specific markets. So I really can't offer guidance with -- at that level of precision, the mid-year of the current year.\nCarl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, maybe ask it in a different way. If the headwind that you're talking about is 750 basis points, you talked about sort of the seniors' ability to handle adjustments to that, what would you view as being a reasonable amount that a senior could handle in terms of benefit design changes in a given year?\nStephen J. Hemsley: I have no basis to really speculate around that. Let me go back to a couple of things. If you think about it, that spread that you're focusing on, we're attacking by, in part, taking benefits down in a way that maintains the value and viability of the program. And it is -- it runs a spectrum across markets. So it's not like a universal thing. This is done at a relatively precise level market-by-market. Network shaping is also that. We have historically sponsored a very broad, very open access kind of market for our Medicare Advantage. We will be forced to narrow that. We are focused potentially on operating costs across-the-board. So those are the elements that we're really playing. And then, obviously, we are, as I said, we're operating in a way to maintain the long-term viability of the program. But my second point in there was protecting margins. The sustainability of the program has to be that it is one that returns capital. So we are protecting the margins of that program. And that is a market-by-market proposition relative to our set of assets in the marketplace, as well as the way the program is being administered by its sponsor in those markets. It's a complicated proposition, but I can assure you we are focused on closing as much of that gap as possible. And seniors are clearly going to participate in it, pursue the benefit reductions, narrower access. So none of these things, the underfunding of the program is not a good thing for American seniors who benefit from these programs. But we are trying to navigate that in the best way possible to preserve these programs [indiscernible] long term because we think it has compelling long-term growth aspects and value to the administration in terms of what it can do for Medicare.\nOperator: We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowan.\nChristine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Optum seems to be running generally ahead of expectations. Is there any change to the long term Optum objectives that you outlined at Investor Day? And you talked about international being a substantial opportunity. Where else do you see good opportunities in Optum?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Larry, you want to comment?\nLarry C. Renfro: Christine, this is Larry Renfro. And I think you know that we put together a, what I'll call, a multi-year business plan back about 18 months ago. We call that One Optum. And when we did that, we wanted to make Optum a more potent solutions organization and we wanted to really position ourselves for the future. And at the same time, we made some financial commitments to you guys on the ROIC being 15% by 2015, a 6% operating margin by 2015 as well as doubling our operating profits so -- of 2011. So those goals that we set at that point in time we're kind of marching down the road. We are hitting those pretty well and meeting expectations and sometimes actually doing better. The initiatives around them are pretty much around simplification, reengineering, business integration. Really, the whole business alignment and we talked a little bit about the PBM. And in 2013, we have now started to pivot toward growth. And part of the growth initiative, and I forget the part of your question, is that we're trying to really have deeper, what I'd call, larger as well as significant relationships with our customers. And that's actually working fairly well for us right now as well. The other part of growth, as we've been talking about this today, comes from what I'll call new opportunities that surround us around this talk about Medicare rates and the pressure that's going on in the industry. So what all that does for us is cause us to really look for the future and we have to put certain development dollars, as well as innovation dollars in to make all this work. I would say that international would fall into that same category in terms of innovation and development. As we work toward doing a lot of these programs that we are doing today in the United States, we'll be putting them into Brazil. So we're confident that we have planned investments. We're balancing those investments with the growth, as well as cost management. But at this point in time, we would pretty much stand by the overall multi-year plan in terms of our guidance to meet or exceed the high end of the range.\nStephen J. Hemsley: So thank you, all. Once again, thank you for your interest in UnitedHealth Group today. We have had a very solid quarter and a strong year-to-date, both for UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and both continue to grow. Our performance trends are positive. I think it reflects in part the value of our diversified business approach and we remain intensely focused on the remainder of 2013 and on 2014 in the long-term success of the enterprise. So thank you for joining us."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 1, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-04-18 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning. I will be your conference facilitator today.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 18, 2013, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. [Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. \nStephen Hemsley: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our strong start to 2013 and update you in broad terms on the environment we expect for the balance of this year and into 2014.\n As you could see from our release this morning, first quarter revenues grew more than 11% to reach $30.3 billion. We continue to grow market share and increase the number of customers and consumers we serve across every one of our businesses that make up the 2 core platforms of UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Our results reflect the consistent combination of fair and steady pricing disciplines, fresh innovation in our products and approaches, the capacity to address the changing needs of many of the key health care markets with comprehensive and integrated solutions and the fundamental values of consistent, responsive and compassionate service in everything we do. These elements all play to the steady top line growth we have been fortunate to realize this year and over the past 3-plus years as UnitedHealthcare has added a net 5 million U.S. consumers, virtually all organically, over that challenging economic period, and Optum has emerged as the distinctive enabling platform for advancing change across the health care system.\n First quarter net earnings were $1.16 per share and were driven in particular by stronger earnings from Optum. Cash flows from operations for the quarter of $1.1 billion represented 85% of net income, a 9 percentage point improvement from the first quarter last year. Our balance sheet remains strong with $3 billion free cash and quarter ending debt-to-capital ratio of 36%. We repurchased more than $0.5 billion in shares for the quarter, consistent with our annual plan; paid $216 million in dividends, a 29% increase year-over-year; and our return on equity for the quarter was about 15%.\n Turning to UnitedHealthcare. In the commercial markets, we worked closely with one of the largest fully insured customers in the nation to convert its coverage arrangements from risk to fee status. While the bottom line impact of this conversion is negligible, revenues are impacted significantly in this business by $2.5 billion annually.\n Looking through this jumbo 1.1 million-member conversion, our organic consumer growth is pacing ahead of our plan for the year with first quarter commercial membership growing 375,000 overall, self-funded benefits up 480,000 people and risk-based benefits down a better-than-expected 105,000.\n Commercial pricing yields are tracking well with our expectations, and the commercial care ratio for UnitedHealthcare came in at a solid 78.3% for the quarter. We are lowering our full year commercial medical care ratio target by 80 basis points from 82% to 81.2%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in large part, to reflect the large case funding conversion.\n Growth across our Medicare offerings was even stronger. We added a net 300,000 seniors to Medicare Advantage, 145,000 to Medicare supplemental benefits and 485,000 to standalone Part D drug benefits. As expected, Medicare & Retirement margins were down in the first quarter given the Medicare ACA rate reductions, the shift of our traditional level of first quarter Part D profits to later in the year with the introduction of our enhanced plan design, the strong level of new growth in Medicare Advantage and, significantly, from unusually high levels of reserve development in the first quarter of 2012, which we were never expected to repeat in '13. And sequestration will now add further margin pressure over the balance of the year.\n In Medicaid, we grew a net 65,000 people, representing organic growth of 125,000 offset by a divestiture impacting 60,000 beneficiaries, and we see no end to the growth opportunities. We've been privileged to expand services in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Florida. We look forward to the significant opportunities to grow and serve additional states and to seek further in-state expansions, as the Medicaid proposal pipeline remains robust.\n And lastly, we are pleased with the very strong growth of more than 200,000 commercial lives at Amil in the first quarter.\n In all of these broad categories, Commercial, Medicare, Part D, Medicaid and International, we are trending to the high end or above our growth outlook for 2013.\n Looking at UnitedHealthcare on an all-in basis. The first quarter operating margin of 5.8% was well within the range of our expectations. As we also expected, reserve development levels of $280 million for the quarter were sharply less than the unusually high $530 million in development in the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2012 also benefited from a care ratio rebate true-up of $130 million.\n First quarter 2013 saw greater positive development in the commercial business than in the government-sponsored program, but overall, our cost estimates are proving to be quite accurate. Operating cost management across UnitedHealthcare continues to be a strength even as we continue to spend to meet the extensive requirements of the new health care regulations.\n Turning to Optum, the growth pace accelerates further. First quarter earnings from operations nearly doubled. Revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, a nearly 15% year-over-year top line growth performance. Every Optum segment grew organically and benefited from the continuing efforts to integrate and simplify the organization, focus on the customer and pivot to growth. Revenue growth was exceptional with OptumHealth growing revenues 26% to $2.4 billion, OptumInsight growing 15% to revenues of $773 million, and OptumRx growing 10% to revenues of $5.2 billion.\n For Optum, margin restoration and expansion was an area of intense focus in 2012, and it remains so. The progress has been impressive with Optum's operating margin at 5.9% for the quarter compared to 3.4% for the prior year quarter and with each of Optum's businesses meaningfully strengthening its margins.\n OptumHealth doubled its margins from 4.7% to 9.3% for the quarter, OptumInsight advanced from 13.3% to 19.3% first quarter margin, and OptumRx expanded from 1.5% to a 2.3% margin even with continuing costs associated with the significant current year in-sourcing efforts.\n The market needs and is looking for the enabling capabilities Optum offers. We anticipate further client developments in coming quarters will illustrate just how strongly Optum is maturing, holding its focus on execution and customer service and pivoting to growth.\n As we assess our position and our outlook, now informed by the events and perspectives of the first quarter, we remain in a strong overall position with our unique diversified businesses growing and performing well. That's in large part because we are serving customers well, we're steadily advancing our agenda of value and innovation and strengthening and readying our businesses to both navigate the coming market changes and then maximize the market opportunities with the right timing.\n As we move beyond the successful TRICARE implementations and migrations of more than 12 million consumers to the OptumRx platform, we will redeploy energies and resources to advance new areas. The early themes of these new areas have been discussed with you before. They include: the comprehensive \"New Basics\" services model; a deep and substantive commitment to the rising importance of the consumer in health care; repeatable innovation disciplines and capability; deeper service and experience integration using simpler enabling technologies; and the acceleration of One Optum.\n The businesses themselves are positioned to grow and perform well in service to their markets. UnitedHealthcare businesses are growing well across the board. Customer retention remain strong, and the new Military & Veterans platform is in place and operational. 2.9 million people from military families joined us on April 1.\n In relation to the exchange markets that will begin in 2014, our views from last quarter remain unchanged. We will be very selective in where we participate and do not believe the exchanges will be a significant factor for us, either plus or minus, in our 2014 commercial market outlook.\n Amil is off to a strong beginning with its seasonally strong first quarter and has the potential to exceed its earnings plan for the year. We see this market and Amil's market-leading offerings well positioned to grow and diversify in the traditions of both Amil and UnitedHealth Group.\n Optum's momentum in growth and margin expansion should accelerate as it becomes increasingly capable and mature. Optum is now tracking to reach or exceed the upper end of its earnings outlook for 2013 and is establishing its own reputation for fundamental execution, service and innovation.\n While we are performing well, we are doing so in a challenging economic, regulatory and health care climate. The headwinds we have discussed in our past sessions with you remain very real. By far, the most impactful headwind is the Medicare Advantage rate picture for 2014. While the final guidance was improved from the negative 8% all-in starting point, it is still a significant challenge. The cumulative net effect of the SGR resolution, the mandated ACA rate reductions, the strong negative impact of the risk recalibrations and the insurance stacks still leaves the Medicare Advantage program significantly underfunded, a more than 4% net reduction against the typical industry forward medical cost trend outlook of 3% or more for 2014.\n These rates will undoubtedly impact the more than 14 million Medicare Advantage beneficiaries across the nation and will cause UnitedHealthcare to reduce benefits and pull back access in certain markets and will affect the growth prospects and earnings potential for our overall Medicare Advantage offerings across all our markets for 2014.\n We do not expect the fastest-growing, most popular and most effective of the Medicare benefit options serving America's seniors to be underfunded to this extent in 2014, particularly with the backdrop of the already existing ACA mandates and sequestration. We will take the time to fairly assess the implications to our 2014 UnitedHealth Group growth outlook and whether our growth expectations for 2014 can be sustained in light of the continuation of both sequestration and a significantly greater rate setback than anyone could have expected.\n Coming back to 2013, our original outlook did not factor in sequestration, which began on April 1. It has the potential to burden us in a range of $250 million to $300 million over the balance of 2013. We plan to absorb that within our $5.25 to $5.50 per share earnings outlook range for this year, which keeps us oriented to the midpoint of that range for now. And as always, we are committed to delivering to the absolute best of abilities for you.\n Our balance sheet is strong. Our cash flows from operations are expected in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion this year. We have already targeted returning up to $4 billion of that to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.\n We expect the general narrative of UnitedHealth Group's story for 2014 to be largely the same as 2013. Our commercial benefit businesses, international businesses, Medicaid and military businesses should all continue to perform well. Medicare will likely experience market exits as well as in-market membership contraction as we reshape Medicare networks and benefits to respond to the continuing underfunding of this program. We will continue to manage operating costs and improve both service and productivity for this program. Optum will continue to grow and contribute more to our overall performance, as virtually every Optum business and product line is growing and performing well and is expected to continue in that path. We remain optimistic about the capacity and capability of our enterprise to serve society and to create the value for the people and customers we serve as well as for the health system at large.\n Despite the great attention paid to rules, regulations and political maneuvering in health care, we keep sight of the fact that health care is about people: patients, individual consumers, physicians and other care professionals. If people are served well with appropriate-quality care provided in a respectful and compassionate manner at a cost that's reasonable and if the professionals who provide that health care are treated respectfully, then our health care system and our enterprise will move forward.\n UnitedHealth Group has been built as a living, evolving set of businesses focused on working, serving and innovating on behalf of the people we serve in the communities where they live, putting capital to work to create a distinctive return to investors while simultaneously advancing the health care system for a distinctive and constructive return to society. Our strategy, market positions and consistent execution for customers differentiate us, and we are committed to responding creatively and aggressively to these more intense headwinds.\n Now we'll be happy to take your questions this morning. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nRalph Giacobbe: Just wanted to go back to the conversion. Maybe you can help us size the headwind from an earnings standpoint. And then, are there many more accounts that were this large that are still risk based, and any comment on sort of incremental appetite to shift ahead of 2014? \nStephen Hemsley: Yes, I think Jeff Alter will -- the impact, as we said, was really negligible, but Jeff Alter can really take you through this. \nJeff Alter: Yes, I think it's important to keep in mind that this was a very unique case, a $1.1 million fully insured case. I think it's probably the largest fully insured case in the industry. It was fully insured for decades. We've been partners with this municipality for a very long time, really because of regulatory constraints, and the conversion shouldn't be seen as anything, just playing out a decade-long processes of putting this case into a self-funded condition where most cases these size have always been. There aren't any -- as you can imagine, a case this size, there really isn't any earnings headwind. It was a long 3 -- almost 40-year relationship with this client. So the earnings are stable, is really just a plain funding conversion. \nRalph Giacobbe: And then what about on the smaller side? \nGail Boudreaux: Just -- yes. This is Gail Boudreaux. Just to follow Jeff Alter's comments. To the second part of your question, overall, actually, our conversions to self-funded have been relatively consistent. There's been a longstanding movement from fully insured to self-funded. But we didn't -- we have not seen any acceleration in that, to your earlier question. It's been pretty stable. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Sarah James with Wedbush. \nSarah James: Can you speak broadly about 2014 headwinds and tailwinds? I'm interested here in the growth in some of the unique businesses that United has, such as Optum and Amil, but also in the core U.S. risk businesses, particularly given the incremental information that you've received since the last time we spoke on changes to the risk coding, calibration and counting rebasing for Medicare and provider contracting for exchanges with better clarity now on the unit cost basis you'll be using. \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. So I think we'll parse these between -- a little bit between Optum and UnitedHealthcare. I'll start out with Optum, and I think our focus in UnitedHealthcare really will be around -- we will kind of be restating comments we made from our formal commentary about exchanges in Medicare. I think, really, Medicare is the principal headwind on '14. The rest of it, I think, we were trying to make it clear that our businesses are very strong, and our growth is very strong, including Medicare. But Larry, do you want to start with Optum? \nLarry Renfro: Sure. Sarah, it's Larry Renfro. I think you're probably aware of the 3-year business plan that we put together last year. We call it One Optum, and we are -- as we finished 2012, we were in a situation of pretty good momentum that has carried forward in the first quarter. I think also, what we're experiencing with what's going on with rate cuts, there is obviously increased pressure in the market. And as a result, Optum is actually having a lot of opportunity that's presenting itself to us. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to ask 3 people. I'm going to start with Bill Miller and go to Stan Dennis and then to Kathy Hopkins to talk about their individual businesses within Optum so you'll get a better flavor for everything. \nBill Miller: Thanks, Larry, and thanks, Sarah. This is Bill Miller. I would say, on the behalf of OptumInsight, Larry is right that a lot of the growth certainly is expected based on all the work that we did in 2012 sort of establishing some sustainable new levels of performance. But alongside of that, and particularly in Q1, these pressures that Larry spoke about have showed up in Insight in 2 pretty simple ways: one, in our payer market and provider market, it's anything that our businesses do around operational performance, quality and efficiency, anything where our clients are feeling those pressures, those are opportunities that often flow to Optum. That's true in our per payer market around things like payment integrity, and in our provider market, it often shows up in some of our efficiency businesses and revenue cycle businesses. The other thing I would stress that have been key areas of the growth as this environment with higher compliance requirements, particularly in our payer business -- our provider business, we're seeing the uptake of all of our compliance businesses, pretty dramatically over 2012 but also going into 2013, and we expect that trend to continue as the heightened awareness about compliance is here to stay. So that's where I would characterize our big growth areas. There are others, but those are 2 critical ones. And I think they're brought on by some of the environments that both Steve and Larry have discussed. But Stan? \nStan Dennis: Thanks, Bill. Sarah, this is Stan Dennis, and I'm going to comment on the physician businesses that are principally organized within Collaborative Care and specialty networks. I'm going to then hand it off to Kathy Hopkins, and she's going to talk about our consumer-facing businesses. So we had a strong start to the year for this group. The Q1 performance is grounded in the solid plan that Larry referred to, created momentum coming into the quarter across all of our business units, and we remain committed to its execution. The results are driven principally by a healthy balance between growth and cost management discipline. I can't point to one business that drove the results for the group, as all the business units across the group are performing at the upper end of their range. Collaborative Care asset has a broad and growing footprint with solid performance. In a measured way, we are integrating these practices, which is part of our simplification plan, and doing so in a way that it adds value to improving care and affordability in the communities that we serve. We have several lines of business in our specialty networks division, all with strong performance, and the performance of our military reserve readiness business is solid as well. So we had a strong start to the quarter. We have our head down. We're going to continue to focus on executing on this plan, pivoting to growth. And as we do so, we believe these businesses will continue to scale nicely and perform well. Kathy? \nKathryn Hopkins: Thank you, Stan. This is Kathy Hopkins, and as Stan mentioned, I will speak to Optum's consumer-facing businesses. We're seeing strong demand for our care management, financial and distribution services. And as Larry mentioned, we're performing solidly against our 3-year plan. We're enjoying the benefits of our cost management programs that we put in place in the last year and expect these benefits to carry forward. We're also enjoying the benefits of scale and simplification of many of our business lines. We remain focused on execution and continuing to further develop our products and services that help consumers as they choose their benefits, navigate the health care system and make good decisions about their health. These programs are being well received in the marketplace. And as Stan said, I don't think I can point any one aspect of our business that contribute to be the driver, but we are really performing well across all aspects of our business. \nStephen Hemsley: Comment on Amil. \nBill Miller: You may comment here, Dirk. \nDirk McMahon: Sure. As from PBM's perspective, we had a nice growth year, and over the last 12 months, we've grown a little over 1 million members. What I would say, our value proposition remains strong. We've talked about it before in New York. Really, it's all about optimizing health outcomes and minimizing costs, and we do that by using our clinical engine to bring together all the pharmacies, the lab, the medical data, the behavioral data to have appropriate interventions, again, to minimize costs and optimize health outcome, and that value proposition continues to resonate within the marketplaces. \nStephen Hemsley: So pretty positive across the board. And then maybe Gail, you want to talk about UnitedHealthcare? And maybe Dave, at the end, comment on Amil? \nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Two questions, I think, you had embedded there. I'll focus on exchanges and Medicare. First on the exchanges side, I think Steve -- as Steve said in his opening comments, we don't see the exchanges on the commercial side having a significant positive or negative impact in 2014. We do think that there's still long-term growth opportunities in the exchanges, so we're still positive over the long term. Overall, our position on exchanges hasn't changed, as we gave you a broad range at the last call. As we think about the contracting side, again, I think I shared this last time that we see the contracting based on a market-by-market assessment and the economics needed to participate effectively in that market and an exchange. So those rates are going to vary from commercial to something less. We've had a pretty long history of having value-based networks and have been successful at that. And I would tell you, at this stage, our contracting for the exchange markets is going very well, so we feel positive about that. Turning to Medicare. That is the most impactful headwind that we face heading into 2014. Again, I think, in Steve's opening comments, as we think about a 4%-plus rate impact plus the impact of sequestration against the backdrop of a 3% trend in Medicare, that's an accumulated impact that is more significant than we would have expected. So that is -- we are in the process right now of doing our bids. We're doing a market-by-market assessment of what those imply by each of our markets, again, as part of the accumulated underfunding, but we do feel we have a very strong Medicare business. And as part of that assessment, we will be using our clinical assets and looking at optimizing our network to provide the broadest-based support and consistent benefits for seniors, because that's been part of what we've been looking to do. So that would, I think, define the headwind in terms of Medicare for '14. \nDirk McMahon: And the rest of the business line is all strong. \nGail Boudreaux: Yes, and the other -- good point on that. The other businesses, I think, as you saw in our growth this year, really positive about how our products and services are tracking. We're really pleased to have brought TRICARE on this year and feel very positively about the growth trajectory that we've seen, not only with this year, but over the last several years. \nStephen Hemsley: On Amil? \nDavid Wichmann: And Sarah, Dave Wichmann on Amil. Thank you for your recognition of it. It's a very strongly positioned enterprise in Brazil. The brand, the value proposition from its own delivery components, its strong service reputation and the value that they provide to the various communities inside Brazil is, I believe, unmatched. Coupled with that are the market dynamics, which are such that they support meaningful growth in that market similar to what we're starting to see shape up here in 2013. So a combination of those 2 things should provide a good avenue for both revenue and earnings growth in 2014 and beyond. As we step into 2014 and into the future, we also see the potential to access meaningful new markets in Brazil that are not or are underserved by Amil today. And in addition, we see a great opportunity to address services offerings. As you might expect, there is -- there are very little capabilities to the extent that we see with Optum, and we see great opportunity for that enterprise in the future. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. \nChristine Arnold: Could you elaborate on 2 issues related to your commentary on 2014: the collectibility of the Medicaid premium tax and, when you're saying you don't expect the exchanges to impact your commercial businesses, are you including the potential impact of any margin compression in small group? And can you address that potential issue as well? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. So Gail, do you want to discuss that, and then maybe Steve Nelson can talk about Medicaid? \nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Let me start with the first question, which was around the tax on -- insurance tax on Medicaid. Just -- so we've been in a constant dialogue with our state Medicaid directors around the impact of the tax, and we are including that in our rate exhibits as we talk to them. It's recognized as a cost to the program. I think what's important there is Medicaid is a little bit different than Commercial in that our rate negotiations occur not just at a single point in time, but they're ongoing. So they occur at the beginning of the cycle, throughout the cycle, and that's a pretty common occurrence. It's early in the process with them. We are including them, again, in the rate exhibit, and we think that there has been a positive dialogue about that. In terms of the impact on exchanges, our assessment is that at this stage, just given the overall impact, not necessarily commenting on margins in small group, but our overall participation in the exchanges, we have a very robust product offering outside of the exchanges. As I mentioned, one of the tools that we're using are to build value-based products. We've seen most of our small group growth in those products already, so we think we're very well positioned to also have a robust offering outside of the exchange. \nStephen Hemsley: Steve, do you want to add anything further? \nSteve Nelson: Sure, just one point. It's Steve Nelson. I wanted to just add to Gail's comments, we have a very active and robust rate advocacy process and are engaged continuously with the states. And as you know, it's a challenging rate environment, but so far, as Gail mentioned, early, it's early in the year, but those conversations seem to be effective and very productive. \nChristine Arnold: Oh. So am I hearing that you don't expect an impact on small group margins because you've got these value-based products and you think that you can convert people to them? \nSteve Nelson: Yes. \nStephen Hemsley: Yes, I think that's right. Gail, do you want to? \nGail Boudreaux: No, I think we have a whole portfolio of products, Christine, and I think, our -- we've always had a strategy of offering employers a multitude of options. That's been pretty consistent, at least over the last 4 or 5 years. And while there are different pressures, clearly, it's a very competitive market in small group. We work really hard to make sure that we put our clinical and network assets to work to offer employers a broad range. But at this stage, we're not commenting on margins specifically there. \nStephen Hemsley: If we take a look at the growth that UnitedHealthcare has been able to achieve in the commercial markets that has been in the newer products, that has been in a wide variety of products. So I think that we've been deployed in this posture for a few years now. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Borsch: Yes, I apologize if you mentioned this earlier, but can you -- are you prepared to reiterate your view of overall earnings growth for 2014? And if you could, maybe a dovetail into that, what about Medicare Advantage enrollment? Do you -- directionally, can you say if you think that's going to be up or down based on everything that's changing? \nStephen Hemsley: Well, I thought that in our prepared comments that we had addressed that, so maybe I could restate a little bit for you, Matt. \nMatthew Borsch: Well, yes. I'm sorry. I probably -- I just missed it then. You did, okay. \nStephen Hemsley: It is -- I'll be happy to touch on it. But we were comfortable last quarter with the overall '14 earnings growth outlook before the 2014 Medicare Advantage rate actions were taken. So I think, then, as you stand back and look at the basic overall funding in terms of MA, it has been pressured the last couple of years and is already absorbing ACA mandates in terms of a rate reduction. And then if you believe that sequestration would come on top of that, you would never have expected a beginning point of an 8% net reduction in 2014 rates to occur. And then when they -- basically, as that process cleared and some relief was provided, you still stand back and look at a net reduction of 4% or more against an overall 3% cost trend in the program. So taken together with the other pressures, that's really not sustainable funding, in our view, and it will cost us to reconsider our overall '14 growth rate in this program, to evaluate market exits, to address benefits, to reshape our networks in those markets. And that was not really the premise as we basically leaned into 2014 from a growth outlook point of view. So we are evaluating that at this point in time given the finalization of those programs, really, on a market-by-market basis, to the extent they are actions that we can take to mitigate this continued program and the underfunding and assess whether '14 can absorb that change and still grow earnings. So our long-term view on Medicare is unchanged. We're very strong in terms of the efficacy of the program. The underfunding has been a challenge, and we are reassessing that '14, based upon the rate actions that were taken. And that's why, as we discussed in the previous question, that really our focus, when we look at headwinds for 2014, is around Medicare. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. \nJustin Lake: My question is on the government side. Can you -- 2 things. One, can you tell us how much the Part D seasonality impacted the quarter versus the typical that you'd previously seen because of that shift to the enhanced plan? And then you mentioned the pressure on Medicare margins due to rates. It's clear Medicare margins, [indiscernible] they came down, MLR up this year, going to do somewhat similar -- you've got pressures in '14. You've talked about a 3% to 5% margin. Can you tell us how -- are you there yet? Are you close to it? Do you expect to be there next year? Just to give us some idea on how to size that headwind going forward from Medicare. \nStephen Hemsley: So Dan? \nDaniel Schumacher: Justin, Dan Schumacher. So your first question, with respect to the Part D timing and the implications of that on the quarter, as you look at it in the context of our overall UnitedHealth Group loss ratio, you can think of that in terms of about 50 to 100 basis points' impact to our overall group loss ratio in the quarter. Basically, our revenue is -- -- recognition is being shifted out later in the year, so it's a big impact in the first quarter, moderates in the second, and then it recovers in the third and the fourth quarter. With respect to the margin performance in our government programs, our target margin is in the 3% to 5% range, and some years, we perform in excess of that. And we were -- we are near that range now in our performance. \nJustin Lake: So overall, you feel like you're near that range now? \nDaniel Schumacher: Yes. \nJustin Lake: Okay. And if I could just slip one other in on the recalibration, can you give us an idea of what you think that is? I mean, if I did the math right from what you said, you thought it was 8 before, now it's 4. You got 5% back from the SGR effects. So are you saying you think that's about a 100 basis point headwind from the risk or recalibration, the new model there? Or do you think it's more or less than that? \nStephen Hemsley: No, it think it's more than that, Justin, substantially more, which is why we're commenting on it. Dan? \nDaniel Schumacher: Yes. I think, Justin, as we look at the impact of that across the industry, we would size the recalibration more in the order of magnitude of around a 2.5% impact. \nJustin Lake: And I would assume it's higher on maybe HMO plans that code better, have higher acuity. Could it be -- I've heard industry experts say it could be as much as 500 basis points for a real good IPA-based HMO versus maybe even less than 250 for a PPO that's maybe less well coded. I mean, is that about right? \nDaniel Schumacher: I'm not going to comment on specific product offerings, but I will tell you, you're right. There is certainly variation as you look across products and geographies in terms of the impact of recalibration, but not to -- not likely the order of magnitude you're talking about. \nJustin Lake: Okay. So not as wide a spread. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. \nAlbert Rice: Maybe just to take a minute to talk about the OptumRx situation. Have you sized the cost that you're incurring this year to transition that in-house? And does that spread evenly over the course of the year? And is there early commentary on the selling season for them and what that looks like? \nDirk McMahon: Well, I would say a couple of things. So first of all, how is the transition going? We migrated 400,000, and the first of the year, 400,000 members converted. We actually also added 500,000 new members to the platform at the beginning of the year. On 4/1, we just added 2 million members, so we've migrated 3 million members so far. From a run rate standpoint, it'll be $200 million in operating profit. On a run rate basis, we still have some ramp-up costs and development costs in 2013. We haven't specifically sized those externally yet, but we'll -- that's really where we sit. \nAlbert Rice: But you'll likely... \nStephen Hemsley: That was Dirk McMahon, by the way. And you'll likely carry those into the third quarter as you go through that, and then they'll start to peel down in the fourth quarter and into '14. \nDirk McMahon: Yes, that's the important point. We have development and ramp-up of personnel costs throughout the first half of the year. And as Steve said, they'll peel down, and we'll hit our full run rate in 2014. \nAlbert Rice: Any comment about the selling season so far? I know we're still a little early. \nDirk McMahon: We've had some -- we've sold some cases already, of course. What I would say is our proposal buying is up. It is a little bit early. We've seen an increase in proposals over last year, and I guess I -- that's all I'll comment at this point. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. \nChristian Rigg: I just wanted to come back to the revised commercial MLR guidance. I want to make -- is the 80 basis point decline entirely due to the risk to ASO conversion? And then with regard to the quarter specifically, year-to-year, the MLR was down 40 bps. We don't have the prior year development by segment. I'm just try to get a sense for, one, in the change of guidance, is that all related to conversion? And two, what would the MLR have been without the conversion in the quarter? \nDaniel Schumacher: Chris, it's Dan Schumacher. So with respect to the commercial loss ratio and the impact of the funding conversion, it was around 80 basis points in the quarter and on the full year. So that's why we've revised our full year medical care ratio guidance to 81.2% plus or minus 50 basis points, so down 80 basis points from our Investor Day guidance. As you look at the influencing factors year-over-year in the commercial loss ratio, certainly that played a meaningful role in it. We also had the absence of leap year, which is more pronounced in the commercial business, and then pushing the other way would be the change in development as well as the large rebate true-up that we recognized in the first quarter of 2012. So those are the major impacts in the commercial loss ratio in the quarter. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. \nDavid Windley: So I wanted to stick with commercial loss ratio. The -- couple of hospitals have come out and talked about low volumes in the first quarter. Would you say that -- lower than they expected, anyway. Would say that they were more in line with what you expected, or is it too early to see enough development in the claims to reflect those low volumes in the first quarter? \nDaniel Schumacher: Dan Schumacher again. As we look at our medical cost performance in the quarter, we were very pleased with it, and it paced out as we expected. So as you look at both the composition of it from a unit cost and utilization perspective as well as the elements by cost category, we're not seeing any meaningful change in that from what we said in Investor Day. \nDavid Windley: So your cost trend guidance and the buckets within that guidance are essentially unchanged. Is that -- do I understand that correctly? \nDaniel Schumacher: Correct. \nStephen Hemsley: And we really aren't necessarily standing on claims. We have good visibility with respect to particularly inpatient settings and so forth, so again, unchanged, but we're not sitting and waiting for claims data. That's the only thing I'd like to correct to that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Dowling & Partners. \nAna Gupte: So coming to the quarter, you've talked a lot about the headwinds for the next year. I'm trying to get an understanding of what is your strategy for 2013 and 2014 on the share-versus-margin tradeoff in '13 and how that might play out into '14. Is this... \nStephen Hemsley: I didn't hear this clearly. Could you just restate it again? \nAna Gupte: Yes. So the notion of the share-versus-margin tradeoff between Commercial versus the government businesses. You've expanded margins in Commercial. I understand it's largely leap year and MLR true-up and all that, but the surveys are showing that you and other companies are pricing up in Commercial. So you're certainly moving toward margin over share. If you look at Medicare, on the other hand, Part D, you came out with a $15 product on Part D. You've had outsized share gains Part D, outsized share gains in MA. And what is your target margin? And why should it be 3% to 5% in Medicare when, with an 85% MLR and the MLR flow rate, you can do better than that at a 10% SG&A? \nStephen Hemsley: Well, that's a very good question. But I also would maybe level set this a little bit that we try to keep our pricing and our approaches to the marketplace in a consistent, stable approach year-to-year, so pricing essentially to our cost, trying to innovate and advance a variety of products to meet the different needs of the marketplace. So it is maybe more broad and more balanced than your question suggests, and we are out to optimize the performance of our business and the performance of our margins, no matter what the circumstances are, in the context of maintaining sustainable products and sustainable offerings in the marketplace. And I agree with your point that we should be able to get above target margins at full scale and at full operating performance in mature markets. And I think in many respects, we do that both in the commercial and Medicare sectors. And now after that kind of commercial announcement, I'll hand this over to Gail and Jeff and so forth to kind of respond to the pricing. Jeff? \nJeff Alter: Jeff Alter. Yes, I think Steve said it well. We have a very long philosophy around commercial pricing, which is we price to our forward cost trend and really don't play too many games around that. And that has served us well over the years, and we believe it will continue to serve us well, maybe even service us in a much better way, as we get into the '14, '15 time frame. So I don't think we really are discussing a tradeoff. We just -- we have a disciplined pricing methodology that has served us well, and we continue to employ that as we go forward. \nStephen Hemsley: And while we always have to pay attention to it, the fact is we've had very steady, consistent growth in both self-funded and actually, on a relative basis, market share gains in the risk-based because of the level of contraction in that marketplace and maintaining margins. And then on the Medicare side? \nGail Boudreaux: Well, I think we shared -- I mean, the issue on Medicare, as we shared on this call, is really the underfunding of the program, and we worked very hard on both the clinical side as well as the network optimization, and then finally, our cost structure. That's been an area of focus. So as I think about all of our government programs and our target margins there, we work to be extremely efficient while improving service. So the operating cost is a lever, and then our clinical programs are important to delivering value to beneficiaries. \nStephen Hemsley: And I'd just throw in that basically, these are very well-established, well-penetrated programs in the marketplace, almost 30% market share in Medicare Advantage. And the underfunding pressure is really more intense in the Medicare Advantage product line. So it's not like Medicare across-the-board supplemental offerings, Part D offerings are really different. It's the funding, overall funding philosophies of the Medicare Advantage platform that are -- that need to be strengthened. \nAna Gupte: So just one quick follow-up on that. On MA, as you're doing your product bids, which need to be submitted in June, and all this underfunding you're alluding to in 2014, should we expect that you will be, as we're modeling out 2014, that your margins will get better because you bid more conservatively at the expense of enrollment growth? Or will it go the other way in that you're willing to -- in your optimization, you're willing to gain share and keep losing margin? \nStephen Hemsley: Maybe I will start out by saying, first of all, it's -- like anything in health care, it's a market-by-market proposition, which is why we need to be very thoughtful about how we go forward in this. In some markets, we'll take actions that will be more conservative and more pulling back. In other markets, we may not be -- feel necessary to do that. It also brings in dynamics of network positioning and so forth, so it is a much more multifaceted than simply what our benefit would be in a particular market. And I think that's why it takes time, and there isn't kind of a single-gear response to your question that we'll price like x and calculate market share. Although I would say that, based upon the funding level, you'd have to -- we've been clear we will be pulling back from markets, and so we don't expect the growth in the MA product line, the MA product line, in 2014 to be as robust because of the actions we're going to have to take to, as your point, preserve margins. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. \nScott Fidel: I just wanted to stick on MA, and just interested if you can talk a little bit about utilization trends observed so far in the new membership that you've added so far this year relative to the more mature MA membership that you already have. And then maybe just touch on the lives that you've added in California, particularly relative to some of the PPO products that members were previously enrolled in with competitors and how you're seeing the utilization trends in those members. \nStephen Hemsley: Dan or Jack? \nDaniel Schumacher: Sure. Scott, Dan Schumacher. With respect to our utilization in MA, I will tell you that it's pacing as -- about as we expected. Certainly, our new growth tends to have a higher first year loss ratio, and that improves in the second year. And that improvement comes on the maturation of the revenue as we get more complete diagnoses as well as our clinical programs begin to take hold and those results begin to emerge. So from a utilization perspective, it's pacing as we expected, but obviously, our new growth comes with a higher loss ratio. \nJack Larsen: Yes, and I would say -- Scott, Jack Larsen. The overall portfolio or profile, I guess, of new membership we got was very much in keeping with our expectations. As you pointed out in your question, it's only been 2 months, really, of development with these new members. And so far, I don't think we're seeing anything unanticipated. \nScott Fidel: Okay. Then just as a quick follow-up. Just interested if you can maybe give us some initial comments just on the CalPERS contract that were announced, and then maybe just talk about some of the changes that CalPERS might have made with the new structures that make you more comfortable about participating in CalPERS risk business given that historically, when the public plans that participated used to be a pretty volatile book of business. \nJeff Alter: It's Jeff Alter. It's really hard for us to comment on CalPERS right now. We're pleased. We thought we had a very strong offering for that RFP. We're pleased that we were selected as one of the 4, and we're actually in the second phase right now of negotiations, so very hard for us to comment on that. \nJohn Penshorn: John Penshorn here. [Operator Instructions] \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Carl McDonald with Citigroup. \nCarl McDonald: Was hoping you could walk through the mechanics of sequestration, touching specifically on how much you're assuming you're going to be able to pass through providers in the hit you're talking about and how long you think it will take to fully offset the impacts. In other words, on that last piece, just go into if it's going to be as big of an impact in '14 as you think it's going to be in '13? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. \nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Carl, it's Gail Boudreaux. So as you know, sequestration results in a lower reimbursement of 2% for our Medicare Advantage and Part D program. We've shared this before. We have some natural hedges to that. In Steve's opening comments, we talked about the impact. Our goal, what we're going to be doing is we'll be offsetting our reimbursement where our payments are tied and indexed to fee-for-service Medicare, that will be offset. And then our lower payments to capitated providers. Those that are not as tied to that, we'll be working, obviously, to manage through that as part of the overall program. But obviously, given the time to implement, that's why we've identified the $250 million to $300 million impact in 2013. \nStephen Hemsley: Some programs don't have any, like Part D [indiscernible]... \nGail Boudreaux: And Part D doesn't have any in there, so that's part of the issue. \nStephen Hemsley: And we'll get more absorption as this goes on. We'll get this more absorbed into the marketplace. So the impact, going forward, should dissipate. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. \nJoshua Raskin: I don't want to belabor all the other points. I guess just a question on the repurchases. I know we'll see it in the Q, but could you give us an update on maybe the monthly repurchase numbers, and maybe more specifically, how much was done after February 15? \nDavid Wichmann: Josh, it's Dave. \nStephen Hemsley: This may be the first question we've ever been asked on monthly repurchase activity. \nJoshua Raskin: It was an important quarter, I think. \nDavid Wichmann: Well, as you -- we repurchased about 9.9 million shares in the quarter. And as you would expect, we try to repurchase -- our mechanisms are such that we repurchase more when the stock price is down. And so as it tailed off, our repurchase activity accelerated. I won't get into specifics about what we purchased in the last half of February or through March, but ... \nStephen Hemsley: We're methodical, so... \nJohn Penshorn: But we're very methodical about what we do. And certainly, as our stock price goes down, we're more heavily in the market. \nJoshua Raskin: But you guys have discretion on that, right, based on your corporate outlook and things like that? That's just not a mechanical calculation based on stock price, is it? \nDavid Wichmann: That's right. We do have discretion with respect to that. As you recall, Josh, given the Amil transaction, we were trying to meter to bring in a debt-over-debt-plus-equity at 35% by the end of the second quarter of the year. Overall, we said we'd do $2.5 billion to $3 billion of share repurchases. So we're edging up towards the upper end of that range for this year. And so that, obviously, mathematically, would increase our repurchase activity for the balance of the year. \nStephen Hemsley: So it -- we are on plan, and we are the levels that we would have anticipated for the quarter. We are regular and methodical in the marketplace. And I would say when we -- what changes is the pace of it. So we pace it in terms of that, but we are basically at this on a regular basis. This is a methodical program. The pacing of it changes, and that's all. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. \nMichael Baker: I know you commented on the exchanges. I was just wondering, in terms of that, as you continue to evaluate them, how much of a factor is it as it relates to some states now considering taking the Medicaid expansion and running through the exchange? Is that a factor for you guys or really not meaningful in light of the broader picture? \nStephen Hemsley: I'll -- maybe I'll have Steve Nelson comment on this. But what the beauty of our diversified model is, is that we basically cover all the markets. And we've said, actually, probably as much as 2 years ago, when it became clear that this kind of a marketplace channel would become established, that we really are covered on it on both sides, from the Medicaid side and the commercial side, so... \nSteve Nelson: Sure. Michael, Steve Nelson. States are evaluating a lot of different alternatives to -- they're struggling with how to cover their uninsured, bring down the cost of Medicaid programs. So you've seen just one alternative that they're considering alongside a variety of things. And we're very engaged in those conversations with the states and bring a lot of capabilities. And the advantage is, as Steve mentioned, we have broad capabilities not just in the Medicaid program, but across all of our products. And so the exchange decision and conversation is one that is outside of just Medicaid or commercial. So let me just ask Jeff to comment on the exchange strategy. And with respect to -- Nevada, I think, is one in particular that has required us to participate in exchange as part of our Medicaid contract. \nJeff Alter: Sure. It's Jeff Alter. Yes, as we've said in the past, we're going to gauge our participation based upon how we assess each one of those local markets. And I would say that part of that assessment is our commercial teams working very closely with the -- our Medicaid teams coming up with the value proposition for not just one or the other, but for both. And that is part of our decision-making process, as we pace through market-by-market decisions. I will reiterate, though, that as we said in the past, we believe that there's going to be some pacing with exchanges, and it's not just a '14 event. It is a market that will develop and mature and be part of the distribution of small business as well as covering individuals and, perhaps, in some states and some markets, Medicaid population. And as of that market develops, we will make those decisions together. \nOperator: We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group. \nSheryl Skolnick: I'll try to be quick with this question. One of the things that I think the market's focused on, and appropriately, as you have this, is the issues around MA. But some of the commentary and I think some of the concern we're seeing is a perception that MA is the single either largest or only growth driver in the business. Perhaps you can help us to put this in the appropriate perspective and view it with the appropriate level of concern, which is, is it one component of growth? Is it the only component of growth? Can you parse out the growth for us that you're seeing, if not in 2014, then a year like 2012 or 2013? Help guide us in our thinking about the potential impact of changes in MA versus the performance of the rest of the business. \nStephen Hemsley: I think we tried to suggest that the performance of the rest of the businesses is really quite strong. That the business, the Optum businesses not only exceeded expectations for the quarter, the momentum is growing there. And it wasn't in isolated Optum businesses, it was across the entire expanse of that portfolio of businesses and offerings. And we see them as a meaningful growth element and an increasingly growth element for us in 2014 and beyond. And that is really unchanged. I think what's -- what we will have been pleased with is how rapidly this has gotten traction and the substance of it, how solid the business is maturing. The Amil business is another platform that we think has significant potential and where we would be looking to continue to align our combined capabilities and potentially continue to invest to build that to be an even more meaningful platform going forward, 2014 and the years to come. And then the UnitedHealthcare businesses, just take a look at the growth, which is why we came back to the $5 million over the last 3 years. And the broad base of it, growth in every single offering, meaningful growth. We think market share gains across each of them. And it's not just a current year phenomenon, this is 3 years or more. And that doesn't even include the $3 million that we'll be reporting next quarter on the TRICARE business. So the focus is to optimize those businesses across their expanse, and that was the whole purpose of the diversified business model in the first place. And Medicare is one that is getting more than its share of attention because of the fundings posture that it's experiencing. And that one is really focused to Medicare Advantage. We will work through that as well. It is just a more severe funding posture than we would have anticipated given all the elements that have hit the Medicare Advantage program over the last year or so. So does that put it into perspective? \nSheryl Skolnick: It does. I guess what I was kind of hoping for was something more quantitative than that, which might help us think through how much might be at risk. But I don't suppose I'm going to get that, am I? \nStephen Hemsley: Well, I think if you were going to get it, I would have put it in -- carefully put it in the prepared comments. So what I did carefully put in there is that we are assessing this very seriously in terms of evaluating to what extent we can overcome the headwinds of Medicare Advantage with all the other elements of our business and produce growth in 2014. And that's our goal. \nOperator: Next, we have Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. \nKevin Fischbeck: I wanted to stay on this MA side of things, because I'm still a bit confused, a couple of points here. I think it really it really comes down maybe to expectations. It sounds like, versus what we were expecting anyway, the MA MLR, was disappointing. But when you talk about it, the things that you highlight as far as lack of development, as far as Part D seasonality, as far as PPACA cuts, it sounds like all those things you actually highlighted last quarter, and so they were all known things. Did you think that Q1 was in line as far as you feel on the MA side of things, and that maybe it's just a perception side from our side of it? Or was Q1 a little bit weaker than you thought on MA particularly? And then 2, the comments about 2014. Although I understand the rate for 2014 is not a good rate, it is it more or less what I think everyone thought it would be back in January. Obviously, we got hit with a worse proposal, and then it got fixed kind of back, I think, to where we all thought it was going to be. So I'm really trying to understand why the tone has changed so much from the view about 2014 growing, when to me, really, the only thing that's changed in the MA reg is really the coding adjustments. Is the coding just really that big of an issue as far as being the unexpected part of the final role versus where we were before to cause you to say, \"Yes, MA, were not going to be able to grow it, and maybe our whole earnings number is at risk for 2014\"? \nStephen Hemsley: So that's a quite an involved question, but -- so let me see if I can provide a simpler response and answer. We're very happy with our MA business. We have a very good growth. We have very good products. We have great positioning into the marketplace. It is perhaps affected by contrast to the prior year quarter, where we had meaningful reserve development and never anticipated we would ever -- we didn't anticipate it in the first quarter of '12 to have that level of reserve development. We certainly didn't expect it to repeat in the first quarter here. So I think the health of our MA business is quite robust. Our concern is the forward looking. And that may be an expectation issue because, when you take a look at all the elements of -- that have hit the funding experience of the MA program, I think the very significant factor was, in lieu of that background, starting out with a negative 8% and then basically coming out with a final, which is, in essence, a relatively negative 4%, maybe even a touch higher against a 3% overall trend, strikingly higher than -- so the year before was 1.5% in that zone. That would have been more manageable. So it is really overcoming that funding posture going forward that then begins to cascade through a variety of things. To respond to that, you need to think about benefit adjustments that are more dramatic than what we have typically liked to manage in the marketplace, network adjustments that are more dramatic. And so I think the difference is, I know that some people were relieved that the SGR came through and that -- focus on that element. But when you stand back and look at the total funding status of that program, it's down 4%, and that is significant. \nKevin Fischbeck: But that's not what you were -- down 4% what we were kind of assuming the number would be if you throw in all-in. But you're saying that you -- when you made that comment before, you were thinking maybe similar to the way it's been the last couple of years, which is maybe down 1.5%. \nStephen Hemsley: If you are thinking of supporting the program, if you think about that as perhaps the best offering of Medicare in the marketplace, the one that seniors have high satisfaction with and strong growth and strong response and one that manages costs, the posturing of funding, that is what we're taking -- is what we're discussing. Think it is the expectation, Kevin. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Halper with Lazard Capital. \nSteven Halper: Yes. As you look at the development of the state exchanges, understanding that you're being very deliberate in pursuing those opportunities, can you sort of update us on where you think the whole program stands? I know it's a general question. But more specifically, the federal government looks like they're under increasing pressure to get this thing done. And do you foresee any scenarios where the administration has to back off and say, \"We need another 6 months or 1 year to get this done.\" And just your views on that? \nStephen Hemsley: We really don't have any insight on that. We are presuming that these programs and these capabilities will go into market as scheduled. That has been the posture throughout, and we are acting to be ready to respond to those. So we are not seeing or believing or suggesting anything to the contrary. We're presuming that it is, going forward, as planned and as scheduled. \nOperator: We'll take our last question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. \nPeter Costa: Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But can you just go over the operating cash flow? It was fairly very weak in the quarter. When do you expect to reverse itself in the second quarter? And what exactly caused the weakness this quarter? \nStephen Hemsley: Dave? \nDavid Wichmann: Peter, it's Dave Wichmann. Thanks for your question. The operating cash flows were actually stronger this quarter than they were in the comparative quarter last year. And they came in line exactly as we expected. The cash flows at UnitedHealth Group, at least, are seasonally down in the first and second quarters, and they are stronger in the third and the fourth. The thing that really affect that are the timing of a risk adjustment payments, which generally come in the third, and then also the Part D timing, as an example. So but that's -- we're -- we expect to follow pretty much a pattern similar to last year. Operating cash flows for the year should be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, which is 1.3x or more times net income. \nJohn Penshorn: This is John Penshorn. Dave, I think last year, we also had some timing differences around some of those government receivables in the second quarter. They came in early. So it may even be a little more second half biased. Is that fair? \nDavid Wichmann: That's right. \nPeter Costa: Okay. And then you didn't change the guidance on your consolidated medical loss ratio. I assume that's really just the offset of sequestration versus the commercial account conversion. Is that correct? \nJohn Penshorn: That's right, Peter. \nPeter Costa: Okay. and then you talked about recalibration being 250 basis points. Was that over 2 years, or was that over 1 year? \nStephen Hemsley: No, that's 1 year. So that's your 3-part 1-question limit, Peter, so thank you very much.\n So wrapping up our call today, I'd like to recap just a couple of points. Our enterprise is performing well. In the first quarter, we delivered significant growth in people served, in market share, in revenue across all of our businesses and internationally. UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, military businesses, as well as Amil, all continue to diversify and steadily grow. Optum's momentum is accelerating as the market for health services expands, and it's expanding, we think, at kind of exponential levels. And we believe no other company has the positioning, the resources, the people to take on the challenges of health care and succeed in this marketplace and in our mission. So thank you very much for joining us today. We'll see you next quarter. \nOperator: This does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 21, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company's Web site. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We entered 2015 with momentum from a strong 2014 finish and with more growth opportunity and fewer impediments than we've encountered over the last few years. We expect the strength of our performance capacities to become more visible in 2015 and even more so in 2016 and beyond, as we begin to perform more consistently to the full potential of this enterprise. In 2014 both top and bottom-line results exceeded the upper range of our original forecasts for the year. 2014 revenues grew 6.5% to exceed $130 billion and earnings grew to $5.70 per share despite material and well documented burdens from the ACA. UnitedHealth Group's performance in 2014 was highlighted by diversified growth, strong operating and medical cost management and continuing advances in service, innovation and enabling technology, positioning UnitedHealth Group to better serve more people and better respond to the demands of our evolving healthcare system in the coming years. Cash flow from operations in 2014 exceeded $8 billion or 1.4 times net earnings, with fourth quarter cash flows more than $2.4 billion a strong 1.6 times net earnings reflecting the core strength and quality of our business and earnings. In 2014 we raised our dividend by 34% to an annual rate of $1.50 per share. We repurchased $4 billion in UnitedHealth Group shares and return on equity once again exceeded 17%. As we take a more detailed look at 2014 results, UnitedHealthcare's revenues grew 5.3% to $120 billion. This past year, we experienced outstanding growth in Medicaid and better than expected performance across our Medicare portfolio, balanced off by challenges in the commercial and international markets as we entered the year. Beginning with Medicaid, organic growth of more than 2 million people over the last five years, including an exceptional 1 million new members in 2014, reflects a decade of strategic and operational decisions that have prepared us well to serve this ever expanding population in the states that entrust us to administer these programs. The Medicaid market was the first created by and aligned for society's desire to expand care for the uninsured. We have tuned our medical management and consumer engagement techniques to address the needs and experiences of these consumers. Leveraging the in-market personal care approach we use today with dedicated on-the-ground resources embedded within the communities we serve. Our footprint in the Medicaid market continues to grow. Now reaching states where nearly 60% of the Medicaid community resides. We combine a strong benefit value with deep trusting relationships serving the states and the people who rely on these programs and benefits. Today our community and state business is well balanced, serving people in more than 100 separate state programs, from children with young families, to duly eligible citizens with the most complex medical conditions. We continue to steadily grow serving Medicaid with about 60% of our 2014 growth from market expansion and approximately 40% from traditional sources. With year-over-year market share gains in existing programs and participation in new program launches. We expect to continue this pattern of broad-based growth in 2015 with revenues expected to grow 15% to 17% this year. In the senior and retiree market, strong execution drove meaningful growth for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, which added 295,000 seniors in Medicare supplement products and 215,000 people in standalone Part D. In Medicare Advantage, seniors continued to value and choose the modern benefits and support services they receive from managed care. And as you know, sustained government funding shortfalls for Medicare Advantage have hurt seniors, cutting back their benefits and causing disruptions, as products and markets were withdrawn across the industry in 2014, including more than 150,000 seniors impacted by our 2014 market and product exits. Despite this pressure, we grew to serve a net 15,000 more seniors in 2014, a small but hard won achievement. We\u2019ll be back to much stronger growth in 2015 as Medicare Advantage is expected to grow by 200,000 to 300,000 individuals. With Medicare Supplement continuing its long standing growth pattern adding another 250,000 to 300,000 people. As we will continue to serve seniors with our leading market position in Part D, we see an overall Medicare revenue growth rate of 6% to 8% in 2015. As expected, commercial and international markets were more challenging for us over the past year, but we believe this is beginning to turn as well. In Brazil, we grew revenues by just under 9% in 2014, with revenue lift provided by pricing changes and efforts to expand our geographic presence. Price increases clearly pressured membership levels, but are consistent with realigning our products for a sustainable marketplace going forward and we expect stronger market conditions in 2015. At the same time, Amil care delivery system of more than 30 strategically positioned acute care hospital facilities and over 50 clinical practices continues to grow and perform strongly. We are advancing more modern analytics, services and technologies across Amil\u2019s unique integrated benefits in care delivery platform to better analyze and manage costs, strengthen fundamental pricing and improve operational cost structures. Amil has exceptional brand equity. People recognize the quality of Amil\u2019s hospitals and care facilities and consistent value its medical and general benefits offer. Overall we expect revenues at UnitedHealthcare\u2019s global businesses to grow 5% to 8% in 2015. UnitedHealthcare commercial revenues retreated 4% in 2014. In 2015, they will increase and the year is off to a strong start. Consistent with the strategy, we shared with you over a year ago we participated modestly in the individual exchange market in 2014 with the expectation of more significant participation as the market matured. This year we are offering products in 23 state exchanges that are home to 54% of the U.S. exchange market population. This includes eight of the 10 largest exchange market states and 15 states, where we also offer complementary Medicaid plans. We\u2019ve enrolled more than 400,000 individuals through individual public exchanges, with four weeks of marketing still to go. We are ahead of schedule reflecting the brand value and trust in the UnitedHealthcare name. Growth in UnitedHealthcare\u2019s small group and middle market group health business, benefit businesses is also better than we had anticipated in a competitive but generally rational market landscape. The self-funded Employer business is positioned for stronger growth and sales performance in 2015 as well, as we continue to consistently deliver the combination of excellent service and innovation, low medical cost trends and flexible customized approaches, valued by the sophisticated large multi-market customer. Looking at the broader picture, UnitedHealthcare has consistently grown by offering differentiated value, service and execution to its markets. We\u2019ve grown organically by more than 8 million people in the past five years. We should grow to serve over a million more people in 2015, continuing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s track-record as the fastest growing health benefit company in the nation. We are confident UnitedHealthcare is positioned for continued growth including revenue growth of 6% to 7% in 2015. UnitedHealthcare delivered strong operating and medical cost performance during the last year. UnitedHealth Group\u2019s consolidated medical care ratio continues to be the best overall metric describing medical cost performance across UnitedHealthcare\u2019s diverse benefits businesses. That consolidated care ratio of 80.9% improved 60 basis points in 2014, and we expect it to remain stable in a range of 80.8% plus or minus 50 basis points in 2015. Medical cost trends in the commercial business were in the 5.5% zone for the year, with great consistency and execution on medical cost performance across the UnitedHealthcare businesses. Hospital usage per capita was lower overall again in 2014 and was lower across each of the UnitedHealthcare benefit businesses. Moving to Healthcare Services, Optum had a remarkable year in 2014 and is positioned to continue to perform strongly in 2015. Revenues grew by 25%, operating margins expanded to 6.9% and earnings grew by 32%, once again above the upper-end of our expectations for the year. Optum surpassed all of its initial 15-by-15 target, return on invested capital, margins and earnings all well ahead of schedule. In 2015, earnings are on pace to triple, since we embarked on the one Optum growth initiative a few short years ago. The fourth quarter was exceptionally strong with earnings growth of 53%. It was also something of a milestone surpassing $1 billion in operating earnings in a single quarter for the first time. Throughout 2014, Optum increased the quality and depth of its strategic relationships in collaboration with clients and partners. It combined good solutions with good execution for the complex problems faced by large sophisticated customers. This included Optum\u2019s assistance for the continued advancement at healthcare.gov and several state exchanges during the year. The one Optum commitments to greater alignment, consistent performance and cross-business simplification continued to develop well and resonated with people and customers Optum serves. A quick profile that each of Optum business looks like this. OptumHealth businesses are gaining momentum in the wake of investments made over the last several years. We expect strong growth in earnings performance in the year ahead. OptumHealth revenues increased by 11.9% and operating earnings grew by 15% in 2014, all while growing the numbers our practices operated and patients and payors served in the care delivery business. Today Optum servers over 2 million consumers through owned and affiliated physician practices. On the consumer side, Optum is aggressively deploying better approaches and new technologies for consumer engagement, health enrollment and personalized consumer service and support. At OptumInsight, 2014 revenues grew 10.9%. Operating earnings grew by 21%. And the external contract backlog rose nearly 20%. OptumInsight\u2019s $8.6 billion backlog provides a clear indication of the future revenue performance and services. A prime example here is the unique Optum One analytics platform, which brings together a clinical, plain demographic and care management data to provide both backward and forward looking views of patient populations, which are ripped with a rich and distinctive clinical encountered data set of over 55 million lives and expanding rapidly. We expect to increasingly drive positive impact for care providers and the consumers they serve. OptumRx grew revenues by nearly $8 billion or 33.2% and operating earnings grew by 67% in 2014 as benefits were realized from the transition of the UnitedHealthcare commercial pharmacy business. OptumRx won external business awards to serve well more than 1 million people in 2014 and is tracking to a similar level of growth in 2015. The secular trends toward more complex and expensive specialty medications play directly to Optum\u2019s strength in synchronizing and integrating medical and pharmacy benefits, providing uniquely personalized service. Optum is advancing this approach with UnitedHealthcare commercial customers in 2015 and expects to see further market interest in its capabilities in 2016. Looking forward to 2015, our expectations remain consistent with those we shared with you at our investor conference in early December. We are off to a strong start with Optum pursuing large strategic relationships and the UnitedHealthcare\u2019s domestic medical membership, some 250,000 people ahead of our Investor Conference outlook as we close 2014 and with continued strength into early 2015 as we discussed earlier in our remarks. For UnitedHealth Group, we are projecting high single-digit percentage revenue growth in 2015, with earnings growth potentially reaching the double-digits at the upper-end of our earnings range. Following established patterns, we expect first quarter earnings to decrease sequentially from this quarter but perhaps not to the levels reflected in current analyst estimates. From there we expect the second quarter to rise sequentially and quarters three and four to have smoother progression than in 2014. We expect performance to further improve in 2015 in a number of key areas. And let\u2019s spend a minute on those areas of focus. We expect to grow at a very solid pace, capitalizing on market opportunities and commercial benefits, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the continuing momentum of Optum. Amil\u2019s performance will strengthen in 2015, led by balanced pricing to address medical cost trends and the use of new approaches, analytics and technologies to improve the total performance of both benefits in the care delivery businesses. We are committed in 2015 to growing, strengthening and deepening customer and consumer relationships at the enterprise-level across the UnitedHealthcare and Optum. In this way, the breadth of services and capabilities can be dedicated to meet the needs of the largest and most sophisticated customers of healthcare from the federal government, to the U.S. military, to individual states, national employers, leading hospital systems, life science companies and to increase our focus on national health systems in other countries. This year we expect to significantly increase the number and quality of these important relationships that we are privileged to serve. Excellence and consistency in operational execution will remain an important focal point, everyday, all year long enterprise-wide. Already in late-December and January, we quietly on-boarded over 5 million people to our newly developed rally consumer engagement digital health platform. And almost 6 million to Advocate For Me, our consumer support and service technology. And nearly 400,000 physicians are now served through our cloud-based link service platform with a goal to reach 600,000 by year-end. We expect to further advance these and other next-generation consumer-centric healthcare tools in coming months, together with updates to our rapidly growing portfolio of mobile applications and cloud-based services, these technologies will serve to enhance and modernize our overall consumer and care provider experience in 2015. The key focal point within this area is our commitment to achieving four star or better performance for at least 80% of our Medicare Advantage customers by 2018 and 2015 is the year this work gets finished for 2018. We expect to perform well on medical cost for our customers, we deliver to our customers and members a valuable package of cost-effective network options and simple, useful information about quality and treatment choices supported by consumer outreach and effective medical management. In 2015, we foresee our volume of care delivered through value-based contracts exceeding $43 billion and as we help deliver improved cost and quality transparency. In 2015 we will hold the strong financial disciplines. We expect to return capital to shareholders through a rising dividend and consistent share repurchase, while we maintain a discipline M&A outlook to further strengthen our capabilities and scale to benefit customers and consumers. Our brand equity and recognition will mature in 2015 with Optum and the UnitedHealthcare each refreshing their efforts to reach consumers and thought leaders across their health system. We spoke at the December Investor Conference about a fresh vocabulary for our enterprise, words like consumer and care provider value, precision and consistency in our work, simplicity, driving the last mile in the integration of data, services and transaction processes, rapid adoption for innovation benefits serving consumers and care providers, flexibility, adaptability and a more urgent pace of change. These things will become much more than words in 2015. Every year brings challenges and 2015 will be no exception, how we meet those challenges will define the character of our enterprise and its leadership team. We expect to continue to build by focusing on serving our customers and serving you as our shareholders, all year long, guiding continued momentum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. We thank you for your interest this morning, and we will now return to your questions, just one per analyst please. Thank you.\nQuestion-and:\nOperator: Floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) And we can take our first question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: My questions are on the commercial risk market, it certainly looked like membership stabilized in the fourth quarter here and Steve you talked about being ahead of plan early in the year. Can you expand on what is driving that change in membership trajectory and give us an update on the pricing environment in general? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure, I think this morning I am going to ask Dave to kind of take point on the UnitedHealthcare elements of questions. So, Dave you want to take that and then engage the team?\nDave Wichmann: I\u2019ll just maybe just make a couple remarks then I\u2019ll quickly turn it to Jeff. Thanks for noticing the progress we have made in the commercial risk market in the fourth quarter that carried over into Q1 as well and as you look at it, it is both on and off exchange and I think you\u2019ll hear from Jeff that we have very disciplined pricing as part of that as well, so Jeff?\nJeff Alter: Good morning, Justin. It's Jeff Alter. Yes, we had a really nice quarter in '14 and a really nice start to '15, primarily driven by our new products we have put into the marketplace in reaction to the beginning of 2014 in some of our challenges around price points. So, we worked really hard, tried to create products that were tied to network design and benefit plans that saw a different value proposition to many of our markets. We first began to see a churn in on membership profile around much better improved persistency of existing accounts, then we saw some of our value around affordability, helping our experience rated accounts and then as we moved into '15 I think our exchange expansion also helps create some additional products portfolio advancements off exchange that have been selling really well. Your question around pricing, as Dave mentioned our pricing remains consistent and stable. I think that is also helping us as others are -- our pricing maybe a little bit to fix the shortfall in there, past pricing efforts and I think the market remains as stable as we have talked about, competitive and no real change to that portfolio of pricing across the various markets that we serve.\nOperator: We can take our next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, maybe if I could ask you there to build on that and stay in the commercial market territory and maybe you can just tell us what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the evolution of the small group market, how much erosion if any you\u2019re seeing with coverage whether that\u2019s going to be exchanges or not? And then perhaps more broadly in commercial what you\u2019re seeing within group retention with the economy strengthening?\nStephen Hemsley: Jeff?\nJeff Alter: We, again '14 we were minor players in the exchange so we don\u2019t have a lot of information. I will tell you that I think it\u2019s well within that range that we have talked about over the last couple of years a few percent of that small group market eroding into the exchanges at least at this point. I think the growth in the exchanges both in '14 and in '15 are really driven by the uninsured and that expansion through the subsidy. So we have not seen a significant erosion of our small group business, just a reminder over the years that business has gotten to the point where roughly maybe 50% or 55% of those employers cover that\u2019s down from maybe 60%-65% in the 90s so this is going to continued erosion of that market over the years. I think you had a second question around our pricing environment?\nMatthew Borsch: Well, it was really around the -- whether you\u2019re seeing some in group iteration, whether you\u2019re seeing trends stabilize and to what extent perhaps as a result of the strengthening economy?\nJeff Alter: Our in-group attrition has flattened that is probably due to the economy and then earlier in the year we did have some in-group attrition that was related to the ACA that has leveled off.\nMatthew Borsch: Alright, thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: We\u2019re really seeing growth on the exchange off the exchange and in the self-funded marketplace too.\nMatthew Borsch: Correct.\nStephen Hemsley: So we\u2019re really seeing pretty broad-based response to the offerings you\u2019re putting out in this point of time.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Thanks. I was going to shift to Optum, Optum and in particular Insight had a really good fourth quarter margin. I wondered if you could elaborate on that for us and the sustainability of that. And then speaking about the Optum margin progression over the next few years toward the 8% goal?\nStephen Hemsley: Larry?\nLarry Renfro: So Dave it\u2019s Larry Renfro, I\u2019m going to ask Bill Miller to participate in this question as well. So I think you probably recall that we had gone through our business plan this year from the start talking about how the fourth quarter would end with a couple of things going on. We had a great fourth quarter with the $1 billion in earnings that Dave talked about, but we were positioned for that quarter to have seasonality that\u2019s our 40-60 split on our business for the year and the planned investments we expected to kick-in and to start to pay-off and OptumInsight would be a part of that and that\u2019s Optum360. And then we had a third area of simplification and integration on our products and my comment on that is that everything worked as planned. We exceeded slightly the expectations we gave you at our December Conference. So we\u2019re off to a very strong fourth quarter and a great start. I would also say that the question on the 8-by-15 we were on target, we feel good about that. The momentum going into 2015 is very strong obviously for us, but it\u2019s also very strong for our number one customer being UHC. So we\u2019re still firm and the ways that we\u2019re good with the 8-by-15. Bill any comments on Insight?\nBill Miller: Yes, obviously it was a very strong quarter and I think it sets us up very well for '15 and beyond at backlog growth I think there is clearly a recognition that a few of the key things that we\u2019re bringing to the marketplace and have invested in are maturing, there is acceptance for example of the 360 side of our business which we talked a lot about which is our revenue management platform. We\u2019re well on our way to the customer acquisition that we target, but more importantly and what\u2019s exciting is the results that we\u2019re generating for our clients are starting to come through in terms of their financial and operational performance. We\u2019ve made investments in data and strengthened our hand particularly from a clinical data standpoint that has clearly differentiated us. We had a record quarter and expect another record year with sales, new client acquisitions and revenue from our data differentiation both in the provider marketplace and in the life sciences arena as well. Clearly we\u2019ve added critical clients on the government side, working with several states on exchanges. And then finally I would say we\u2019re really happy with our entry into the physician management business, where we\u2019re going into practices, health systems, helping them turnaround and help drive better performance quality in their physician practices. We entered that market last year. We\u2019re very confident that that is going to be a strong contributor for the future of OptumInsight. And so all of those things combined together I think show a lot of diversity in what we do, a lot of areas to grow and feel pretty confident not only about 2015 but beyond.\nOperator:\n. :\nPeter Costa: You put forth on the Investor Day a view of cost trend rising 50 basis points faster than it did last year, some of your competitors have put forth views of trend that's a little bit ahead of that. Why should we not be concerned of perhaps some of the improving view and membership on the commercial business, is it because you have perhaps underpriced that business? And specific to that in terms of cost trend can you talk about how your view on specialty pharma in particular Hepatitis C drugs, is evolving this year relative to last year?\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, Peter it\u2019s David and you\u2019ve got a lot in there. I am going to have Dan respond to you, I will just maybe comment globally on our ability to manage medical cost and trend. I think it's no surprise that we have been able to create distinction there, vis-\u00e0-vis our competition for some time. We do a very good job of controlling utilization and an excellent job as well in terms of taking a full review of our cost structures and putting it into our pricing which is the discipline we've applied for years now and I think it's consistently produced good results. So Dan I\u2019ll ask you to comment further.\nDan Schumacher: Good morning, Peter, it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. So, let me handle first the medical cost sides, talk quickly about pricing and then a little bit on Hep C I think those are the three elements you are interested in.\nPeter Costa: Yes.\nDan Schumacher: From a medical cost standpoint just kind of looking at 2014 broadly, we\u2019re very pleased with our medical cost performance. And in the fourth quarter in particular we again came in a little bit better than what we had expected and that's true in our commercial business, as well as in our government businesses. As we look at the utilization under that more specifically, that continues to be very well controlled, Steve did mention that again this year we were able to drive an absolute reduction in our hospital usage per capita, we did that in each business and that was the sixth consecutive year we've been able to drive an absolute reduction in hospital in patient usage per capita. So when we put that all together from a commercial standpoint our cost trend for 2014 came in actually a little bit better than the 5.5% that we had guided to at the end of -- at the beginning of December as well as the low-end of the range we guided to a year ago. As we think about our trend into the future, we have assumed that we're going to see a moderate increase in utilization in each of our benefits businesses and that outlook is what informed our pricing, as well as our benefit planning. And I'll tell you with December behind us and the majority of January behind us as well, we're not seeing any indication or evidence of an increase in utilization. So we feel very comfortable with our forward outlook, commercial cost trend for 2015 is 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Sitting here today, we have 75% of our revenue for 2015 locked-in and the vast majority of that revenue comes from retained accounts those are customers that we have experience with and we understand their performance, so we feel very comfortable with not only our cost trend outlook, but also in relation to where we're positioned from a revenue standpoint in our commercial business. Lastly you asked about Hep C. Obviously that's a category of significant focus for a lot of people as of late. In 2014 obviously we revised our expectations for cost coming out of the first quarter and I would tell you that we tracked very much in line with that over the balance of 2014. As we look to 2015 we do expect an increase in those costs in each of our businesses, we've reflected that and captured it in our outlook. So, we feel comfortable with where we are positioned.\nPeter Costa: Can you give us some specifics on how much cost increase you expect in 2015 and precisely what you are doing regarding negotiating between the various drugs in Hep C?\nDan Schumacher: What I\u2019d tell you Peter is that we're constantly working to manage cost and drive greater value. In this space we're pleased to see competition. As we look at new product launches particularly in very high cost categories we have a very rigorous process, it's a process that evaluates the clinical equivalency of the drugs. We look at the effectiveness of each drug. We design clinical programs to ensure appropriate use. And then we obviously are looking at the PDL and formulary implications and then we're negotiating relationships that really drive the best value for our members and our customers. So, we don't talk specifically in this form about manufacturer relationships, but rest assured we're all over this.\nPeter Costa: Thank you much.\nStephen Hemsley: So, Peter just to maybe to close that out, just to be clear and taking Jeff's comments earlier and Dan's comments now I think it's really our product positioning exercise that and possibly some firming of the market that's caused us to advance our business. The other thing I\u2019d -- so I think you can conclude that we're not under pricing the business. The other thing you can look at is our relative MTTR performance for the fourth quarter versus the full year. And if you look at that you will see that that we're performing better in Q4 than we did for the full year we have performed very well for the full year, but you can see some acceleration in performance as well. So hopefully that closes out that issue we\u2019re not surprising.\nOperator: And we can take our next question from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAndy Schenker: So if I\u2019m doing my math here correctly let\u2019s say you guys are forecasting about 19% to 20% growth in value-based care or care delivery on your value-based contract, maybe if you could talk about a little bit how that\u2019s split between commercial Medicare and Medicaid? And also how those value-based contracts are impacting both your enrollment, are you seeing outsiders enrollment in those products and then also around your expectations around cost trends? Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Okay I\u2019ll have Dan comment on this obviously it\u2019s a key area of focus for us to align incentives with delivery system really anchored on advancing quality of healthcare first but also improving the affordability of it, Dan?\nDan Schumacher: So your math is right. Yes we are expecting about a 20% increase in the concentration of value-based reimbursement. And going from -- we ended the year at about $36 billion of spend in value-based arrangements and we\u2019re looking to drive that north of $43 billion in 2015. And in terms of the underlying businesses, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in all three of our businesses, so I wouldn\u2019t highlight anyone individually. We\u2019re looking to make progress across the spectrum and across the benefits landscape. And we\u2019re seeing contributions to enrollment as a result of those relationships where we partner more distinctly with certain delivery system partners. And on the cost side, we\u2019re also seeing the outcomes there. We talked at the Investor Day, I know we had a breakout seminar to talk about driving 1% to 6% aggregate savings from our value-based reimbursement approaches, and then within that obviously the numbers can be significant based on how they\u2019re designed and as well as how tightly they are aligned around quality and performance and outcome. So we\u2019re very pleased with our progress there. We\u2019re focused on it in 2015 and we\u2019ll be in '16 and beyond.\nStephen Hemsley: I think it\u2019s important to note the orientation of the quality. And the fact that the structure actually drives volume towards the better providers that enter into these performance contracts and that we\u2019re progressing these contracts into more sophisticated forms where they\u2019re actually taking on even greater performance responsibility overtime.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTom Carroll: It sounds like a very confident 2015 outlook. I wonder if you could share with us a bit more commentary on your operating cost ratio. Fourth quarter\u2019s result was relatively high, driven by the obvious, but do you think you see that improving in 2015 much like the rest of your business? And where should it go over the next three years? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Hey Dave do you want to address that?\nDave Wichmann: Tom, Dave Wichmann. So a couple of things, first our operating care cost ratio for the quarter was a little bit elevated at 125 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you know this is mainly influenced by the insurers fee which amps up that ratio by about 120 of the basis points, but what has been pretty persistent in our business is the mix has shifted more towards services. And when you see that mix shift, it tends to put a lot of pressure on this ratio. And so then that increases it even further and then our productivity efforts bring it back down and we\u2019ve seen productivity well managed across our business not only offsetting those impacts, but also inflation broadly. As we look to 2015, the same dynamics play out. We have a little bit of an uptick in the insurers fee, which further presses this ratio, but we also see continued growth in Optum and in our fee-based business overall which tends to press this forward as well. And then we continue to offset that with productivity improvements year-over-year. And we do expect the ratio to be somewhere around 17% plus or minus 30 basis points for next year. And we believe our running physicians supports that.\nTom Carroll: Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next please, next question. Moderator, do you have another, we have answered all the questions this morning? So we may be having some technical difficulties we\u2019re going to. Hello?\nOperator: One moment please, we\u2019re having technical difficulties.\nStephen Hemsley: Well, UnitedHealth Group is still here, I don\u2019t know about the rest of the world at this moment.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nChristine Arnold: Optum360 and particularly for OptumInsight seems to be tracking kind of ahead of even what you were expecting last month. Is there any change to your Optum expectations relative to what we saw at your Investor Day? And then also what are you expecting in terms of margins on your individual memberships on the public exchanges? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Well that\u2019s an interesting combination question Christine. So I\u2019ll have Larry take the Optum side and then we\u2019ll respond to the margins on the public exchange business.\nLarry Renfro: Christine I believe that we are right on target with where we planned to be right now with Optum360 from what I\u2019ll call the planned investment side, as well as the implementation operation. I think you know we have Dignity Health and NovaSure as two of our prime customers here. And nothing has really changed from the investor conference. We were positioning everything to happen in the fourth quarter just as it came through. I don\u2019t know Bill if you have any comments?\nBill Miller: No, I think much has changed. I think our business will depending on what happens with the ICD-10 changes this year, they didn\u2019t happen last year we overcame that, if they don\u2019t happen this year we are prepared one way or another, but I think we are optimistic and see certainly a pipeline that would lead us to believe that not only are we on target but we have got a chance to work ahead but I\u2019d say nothing has changed since the investors conference. And I would say just in terms of customer acquisition, we have always said kind of across our business that we were looking for these eight to 10 rich and deep relationships and I think if you look across all of the customers that we have acquired not only in 360 but beyond, we are halfway to that goal, and we feel very good about achieving that and certainly we don\u2019t see anything in '15 slowing us down to achieve that.\nLarry Renfro: Christine, maybe I could it\u2019s Larry again, let me talk about the 10 relationships that Bill mentioned. We have named two, as we go forward some of our customers they do not like to be identified because of competition, and so some of the visible ways of looking at that half that we have right now would be to look at Optum360 it would be to look at our business in the government solutions area, and you could look at Optum One our data analytics area and you could look at Optum Lab. So there is some other metrics that I think are going to be important to look at from this customer acquisition standpoint. And I am going to ask John Rex maybe hit some of those metrics as well.\nJohn Rex: Good morning Christine, John Rex here. So a few other things that we\u2019d looked at in terms of helping illustrate how we are progressing towards that goal of, be it larger relationships. The average, if we look at since the last couple of years average deal size within OptumHealth is up 80%. Revenue from our top-25 customers within Optum is up 2.4 times. The number of customers with over 100 million in annual revenue has doubled. We\u2019d point to external backlog going up nearly 20% and a pipeline that about doubled over the last year. So those are other metrics we look to, to help illustrate the impact that we are having and gaining these types of relationships.\nStephen Hemsley: I\u2019ll let Jeff respond to public exchange question.\nJeff Alter: Good morning Christine, it\u2019s Jeff Alter again. On in build exchange we built for our initial years to margin of 1% and 2% without any reliance on the risk orders, but we believe longer-term it\u2019s 3% to 5% business and like everything else well endeavored to be in the top-end of that range, as we go forward.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Just staying on the public exchanges, can you maybe give us a little bit of an update on how enrollment is tracking? I think you talked about it being in excess of 400,000, so just wondering if you\u2019d expect to sort of exceed the 400,000 to 500,000 range. Maybe if there is any disproportion in enrollment in any state that you are in? And then lastly recently in California, it sounds like you tried to get in statewide for 2016 but were denied, is the plan just to kind of revisit that in 2017 or are there alternatives you are seeking to still get into that market before that? Thanks.\nJeff Alter: Good morning Ralph, it\u2019s Jeff Alter again. So let\u2019s start with, yes we have had about over the 400,000 level in signups. We still feel comfortable within that range that we gave in at the investor conference between 400 and 500 by at this point I might think more around the 500 and depending on how the next week or so plays out, we could be that, but right now we feel comfortable within that range. The good news for us is we are growing where we said we would grow, which is growing a little bit more in some of those markets than we thought. So at investor conference we talked about some of the bigger markets where we thought we could grow and do well and that\u2019s where we are growing and doing well. So along with our plan that is where the growth is coming in. Now obviously in California we are disappointed, we wanted to bring more choice and options to the residents, to California, we believe competition is good for them, unfortunately we were not able to get agreement from that Board to be in all markets, we did get granted a few markets where there are and as many carriers as they would like, we will -- we are reviewing that now so we might be in California in '16, but in a small handful of markets and we will go back in '17, we believe choices and competition are good for all markets including California.\nRalph Giacobbe: And you anticipate that you\u2019ll expand your portfolio markets in the next year?\nJeff Alter: Yes, outside of California we are working now to expand our footprint into the other markets that we happen to -- we didn\u2019t serve in '15.\nRalph Giacobbe: But you\u2019ll do that in measured ways, it's not all those\u2026\nJeff Alter: Yes we are reviewing those markets now we\u2019ll make some final decisions and let you know.\nRalph Giacobbe: The other thing that\u2019s nice is not only just selling right in the markets that you wanted, but you also sold the products that you thought would sell, right?\nJeff Alter: Correct.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Maybe just ask about the Medicare Advantage obviously you're looking forward acceleration growth I think 200,000 to 300,000 enrollment though was the target at the Investor Day it looks like in January with some of the open enrollment season in Europe 165,000 adds please comment on what you're seeing so far in the open enrollment season and whether that\u2019s really ahead of your expectations inline and any sort of qualitative comment about the market environment and then any early thoughts on the 2016 rate notice?\nDave Wichmann: It's Dave, I think we\u2019ve -- the team has done a nice job of really reestablishing growth in the Medicare Advantage individual aligned but -- and we have continued our very nice growth on the group MA front as well, but I\u2019ll ask Steve Nelson to comment overall on your questions.\nSteve Nelson: Good morning A.J., it's Steve Nelson. Yes we are very pleased with not only how we ended the year but how we performed in AP. As Dave indicated, we drove really strong growth in our group Medicare Advantage business and I would say market leading growth actually, so really pleased with that. But we expect full year growth in our individual membership as well and that\u2019s particularly -- we\u2019re particularly excited about that because of the work we\u2019ve done with reshaping our network and you're seeing premiums broadly into our portfolio, and we are able to grow in the markets that were key to us such as Florida, New York and Texas and Southern California. So really off to a nice start and I would say also we\u2019ve saw some really good results and nice start to Medicare stuff as well. And across those two products really again off to a good start, good place to be, in fact maybe a little bit ahead of what we were thinking and so we feel really good about the ranges that we offered in last December and still get about those ranges. In terms of the 2016 rates, there is a lot of variables that go into the final rate as you know and so you don\u2019t really speculate on that, but I will offer that our position has been -- that it\u2019s just a very successful and valuable program to seniors and it\u2019s had great results in medical costs and improving outcomes. Member satisfaction is up and the program is growing. So, we remain strong advocates for our seniors and their healthcare and we hope and expect that the rates when they are finally published will be fair and appropriate. Overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the positioning of our Medicare business and how we\u2019re heading into 2015.\nStephen Hemsley: We may have time for about two more questions. So, we could take a look at that, maybe two more questions. So next please.\nOperator: Yes. We can take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Maybe just two on the MA side of things, can you talk a little bit about the stars and how your analysis of what stars has meant for enrollment in 2015, are you seeing better enrollment in the places where you have four stars, are you seeing real issues and competitors have really moved up on the stars in the individual side in 2015? And then also and obviously you\u2019ve grown group very significantly for 2015, do stars matter as much when we think about the group business or is that something that overtime you think that it will impact how group perceives the product as well?\nStephen Hemsley: Maybe I\u2019ll start on this I\u2019d like to make it clear that we believe stars matters and that we\u2019re focused on improving our performance in stars and I think we have been very consistent on that theme. It's not clear that, that has had really an impact with respect to how the product is marketed or acquired in markets, but we do believe that it is important -- overtime obviously important from a financial point of view, important in terms of our relationship with CMS who basically established those performance guideline. So, I want to make it clear that we are committed to stars performance but it\u2019s not clear and I maybe see Nelson to comment that that has had really a particular impact in terms of market response to product offerings right?\nSteve Nelson: Sure. No, hi, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. You\u2019re right Steve stars obviously is a factor but it\u2019s one of many and it\u2019s very -- the benefit of planning processes is one that has a lot of factors in it and we take all those things into account as we look at the results that we\u2019ve achieved in AP that is very much in line with our expectations and stars doesn\u2019t particularly spike out as the core driver to any of those results again it\u2019s across so many factors and a lot of including your brand positioning, your brand strength, strength of the distribution, the engagement you have with providers and again that is how you design the product. So there is a lot of factors in there, on the group side stars is important it allows you to price competitively and our group membership has enforced our plans and so that adds to our ability to grow that membership and thus contribute it to that.\nKevin Fischbeck: Well I guess the question is, if 2018 feels like a long way away in many respects so do you think that you\u2019ll be able to go nicely even until you get to that target you don\u2019t need to get four stars to continue to go in the MA business in the meantime?\nSteve Nelson: No, we don\u2019t. And one thing that really hasn\u2019t been mentioned this morning is that, we are clearly in the zone of our growth expectations for MA and we\u2019ve actually advanced premiums in a significant way and to basically to be able to go through that right Steve?\nStephen Hemsley: Right and so advantage is pretty impressive.\nSteve Nelson: And I think bodes well because I think the large portion of establishing premium products in markets a lot of that work got done this year.\nOperator:\n. :\nJoshua Raskin: I want to get back to the commercial business and I guess the question is just sort of about the landscape of employers, commercial employer contracts, basically what are they looking for in terms of products and then have you guys quantified the Optum impact whether there is a cross-sell of Optum products, or you mentioned Rally and Advocate For Me and a couple of these others, you\u2019ve measured this in new wins or higher retention levels and just broadly what\u2019s changing in that landscape where United is now seeing sort of that inflection point on commercial growth?\nStephen Hemsley: So I\u2019ll have Jeff respond to that, I do think that the content of the Optum product in the UnitedHealthcare offering clearly in the way in which supply clearly makes a distinctive difference, but has a lot to do with the way in which it\u2019s applied in the offering, but Jeff?\nJeff Alter: Good morning Josh, it\u2019s Jeff Alter. So I think again from most, everyone of our clients and employers in general this is a very important benefit for them to believe so they look for the value that can be provided, but it\u2019s also one of their more expensive items so they look for a partner who can work with them over the long-term to keep affordability in mind, but also deliver great products, service and innovation and that\u2019s when if you think about the combination of UnitedHealthcare and Optum together working in partnership with the clients and their consulting and their brokerage create that plan that works for that employer across sort of a very long time stamp. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver anything at any point for that client as their business changes and their dynamics change. We\u2019re able to bring in consumer products that Optum builds, obviously our close tie to OptumRx now that specialty medicine is becoming a cross-factor having the close relationship that we have with OptumRx to embed that inside the medical benefit is vitally important for the value proposition that the employer is looking for. And then across the spectrum into OptumHealth our disease management wellness programs, our consumer engagements, employers have spent considerable amounts of money to have disease management wellness programs and are looking for more engagements and the work that Rally and OptumHealth does to go beyond just by creating an offering but actually get that engagement and get that uptake to keep people healthier and engaged in their wellness is vitally important. So I think what we\u2019ve seen is the marketplace has stabilized over the last year or so is that that view from employers looking for a longer term partner who can work with them to create an even more valuable benefit plan an offering for their employees but also be mindful of the cost factors that are involved in it.\nStephen Hemsley: Yes, something to really match the breadth of their offerings and the innovation dynamic and the reliability of continues innovation, continues focus on technology, so that you are building value year-after-year-after-year which plays a lot to the retention rates you have too. So good question and great response, so thank you very much for joining us this morning kind of to sum up 2014. UnitedHealth Group had a clearly a very strong year in '14 and momentum of the business grew throughout the course of the year, so that we ended the year perhaps, our strongest point and have brought that strength into the beginning of 2015 and through consistent execution and consistent focus on performance, serving customers, the people that we serve continuing to drive innovation, matched with a strong financial disciplines we expect our growth to accelerate in 2015 and beyond. We thank you very much for joining us this morning and we will see you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s program, thanks for your participation.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 16, 2014, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we will review our 2014 third quarter and 9-month financial results, results which have been consistently in line with or ahead of the outlook we shared with you nearly 1 year ago. We're seeing steady progress across our businesses, and over the next 2 years, expect our overall business performance to further strengthen and accelerate in both top and bottom line growth. Our top line performance this quarter suggests an improving environment for our offerings, combined with steady consistent execution. Revenue grew 7% year-over-year, led by growth in senior and public sector benefits and across Optum's portfolio of Health Services. Consistent execution is evident in our performance in managing medical and operating costs, successful state Medicaid expansion, moderately improving Medicare star rating, and the value clients are realizing in Optum's provider, payer and government markets, and all of this is in the face of unprecedented healthcare reform across the United States. Our third quarter revenues were $32.8 billion, and earnings per share grew 7% to $1.63 per share. UnitedHealthcare results clearly strengthened with Optum again contributing 30% of our enterprise-wide operating earnings. Operating cash flows of $3.2 billion were exceptional at twice our net income level despite remitting $1.3 billion in federal ACA taxes during this quarter. This morning, we are affirming our 2014 revenue outlook of $130 billion and raising our net earnings projection to a range of $5.60 to $5.65 per share. As always, our goal is to perform in the upper end of our range. We remain focused on executing a deliberate quality and cost agenda because improving healthcare quality and affordability is core to delivering value at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. On any given day, we average 27,000 members in the hospital and another 14,000 at skilled nursing facilities. We have nearly 2,000 clinicians across the nation working with attending physicians to help keep our members on course for optimal medical outcomes, successful discharges and to avoid unnecessary readmissions. Optum expects to perform 1 million Medicare house calls and home visits this year to engage our members, understand their health status and needs, close gaps in care, and advance clinical care paths and services. Over the past 5 years, our commitment to affordable quality care has become ever more integrated, targeted and refined. Modern plan designs harness greater patient responsibility with online tools and consumer engagement services that help people make better choices and decisions to get the right care at the right facility for the right cost. We serve nearly 6 million people in consumer-directed health plans, up from 2.9 million people just 5 years ago, and these consumers have set aside $2.7 billion in healthcare funding through health banking and investment accounts with Optum. These consumers and those in similar consumer-centric programs are motivated to engage and make the best choices about their health and healthcare. Consumer engagement includes making quality and pricing transparency tools available right at people's fingertips, right on their smartphones. These tools tap into our Premium designation quality networks, a commercial benefits program we began in 2004 that now helps link people to nearly 120,000 network doctors, recognized for consistent superior quality and efficiency. These doctors practice in clinical areas that generate more than 80% of our consumers' medical cost experience, and the results are consistently outstanding. Our premium cardiac physicians have 28% fewer repeat procedures and a 29% lower complication rate for implantable cardiac device surgeries. Our premium orthopedic surgeon have 41% fewer repeat procedures and a 17% lower complication rate for knee surgeries. There are more examples like these, demonstrating that getting an engaged consumer to the right doctor makes a meaningful difference. Our commitment to affordability extends to the care delivery side. Value-based contracting has become foundational to UnitedHealthcare today, contracts that align care provider incentives around healthcare quality outcomes, appropriate use of services and total cost of care. Our contracts with value-based medical spend now total nearly $35 billion per year, up from less than $13 billion just 3 years ago and on the path to $65 billion by 2018, if not sooner. The modern health system is being shaped around aligned incentives, supported by transparent information and consistently high-quality clinical services. These changes are helping our nation in turn to achieve optimal evidence-based utilization and cost. We are among the leaders shaping this next-generation healthcare system with Optum working hand-in-glove with care providers in local markets, helping them improve consistency, quality and cost structures so they can preserve and grow their patient basis as their market shifts to performance-based revenues. Our progress is apparent in UnitedHealthcare's year-by-year decrease in hospitalizations per member in every major product category, including in 2014. Over the past 6 years, UnitedHealthcare has realized accumulative 26% reduction in inpatient use per Medicare member and a 16% reduction in inpatient use per commercial member while continuing to improve overall quality of care. To begin a brief but more detailed discussion of third quarter results, we'll start today with UnitedHealthcare. Third quarter revenues grew 6% year-over-year exceeding $30 billion. UnitedHealthcare earned more than $2 billion in the quarter driven by overall revenue growth and an efficient operating margin of 6.8%, even considering the growing mix toward lower margin public and senior sector customers. Third quarter was again led by Community & State, where we grew to serve 250,000 more people. We are now on course to grow by just under 1 million new Medicaid members this year. This record level of organic growth is well balanced with about 60% from health reform market expansions and 40% from established states under new programs that complement established approaches as well as natural growth within the traditional programs. And Medicare continues to be a growth contributor as we approach organic growth of 500,000 people across all products in 2014, a strong and consistent outcome in a year where we took necessary steps that caused some membership losses to position our Medicare Advantage products for future growth and to benefit seniors in the years ahead. Today, we have a more focused and aligned network, supporting Medicare Advantage, a Part D program qualified to serve low-income seniors in 97% of the markets nationally for 2015 and a rising star quality that will continue to advance. For the 2015 payment year, we expect more than 37% of our MA members to be in plans rated 4 stars or higher. We expect a similar percentage in 2016 and sharply improved performance in 2017 and '18 based on efforts launched earlier this year and establishing themselves across our markets. The open-enrollment season began yesterday. We believe our products are well positioned locally. Our sales and marketing resources are properly staged and supported, and we expect solid growth in our Medicare Advantage, our Part D and Medicare supplemental offerings in 2015. In the commercial markets, we remain focused on pricing discipline relative to cost trends, balancing margin and market positioning, all with an eye towards consistency and sustainability for both customers and consumers. The multi-quarter decline in risk-based enrollment has slowed, and the modest decrease in self-funded products were due to employment attrition. In the individual market, we remain on course to participate in nearly 2 dozen state exchanges in 2015 consistent with our original public exchange strategy. In Brazil, pricing increases reflect new baseline costs in delivering expanded mandated healthcare benefit leading to a conscious reduction in membership this year. Despite this decline, Amil's revenues were strong in the third quarter with international revenues increasing 19% year-over-year. Turning back to medical costs, our third quarter commercial care ratio was 79.1%. The consolidated care ratio was 79.7%, a decrease of 90 basis points over last year's third quarter. Earnings were strengthened by continued favorable reserve development across the business as our affordability initiatives continue to perform well. Moving to our Healthcare Services platform. Optum's third quarter included a healthy balance of growth, earnings performance and focused strategic market activity. Through the first 9 months, Optum revenues have grown 26% and earnings from operations by 24%. We believe the fourth quarter will be strong for this platform, and Optum remains on pace to contribute roughly 1/3 of UnitedHealth Group's 2014 cash flows from operations, all while investing significantly in future growth. In the third quarter, Optum's revenues grew 21% year-over-year to $12 billion. Earnings from operations grew 27% year-over-year to $865 million. Operating margins rose 1 full percentage point from second quarter and 30 basis points year-over-year to 7.2%. OptumRx led this quarter's results. Revenues grew 27%. Earnings from operations grew 65% to $326 million, and operating margins were above 4%, improving 0.5 points since the June quarter and 1 percentage point year-over-year. The market is responding to the value of synchronized pharmacy and medical benefits where OptumRx uses data, technology and an integrated service model to address the total medical experience in related costs rather than solely the pharmacy silo. We have seen a number of new opportunities with employers for 2015, and we believe we have been awarded more than our fair share of that new business. This growth is additive to the growth that flows naturally from the businesses of UnitedHealthcare each year. OptumInsight's growth was led by Optum360 revenue management and government exchange services. We continue to deliver services in the development and operation of federal and state healthcare exchanges and look forward to continuing to leverage Optum's expertise to serve our government partners in this important work. With the passing of this quarter, we have fully cycled through last October's regulatory pullback in hospital clinical compliance services. To put the magnitude of this pullback in perspective, OptumInsight's underlying operating earnings growth would have been more than 15 percentage points higher than the 6 percentage point growth we reported this quarter, which only highlights the strength and momentum of the diversified product offerings we offer in this segment, including the commercial version of our hospital clinical compliance capabilities that is gaining traction with hospitals in the market and is becoming a future growth driver. And our position as a valued service provider to hospitals further advanced with the recent acquisition of the MedSynergies organization. MedSynergies has deep expertise in revenue management for hospital-employed physicians and medical groups. Connecting MedSynergies with our Optum360 inpatient focus creates an end-to-end revenue management offering for large sophisticated integrated care delivery systems. Coupling these with Optum's clinical software, analytics and workflow tools gives us a comprehensive and market-leading solution to serve delivery systems covering both administrative and clinical domains across the full continuum of care settings. Within our Optum's analytics businesses, we expect to end the year with more than 50 million lives of longitudinal clinical data, up 50% in a year, and easily one of the largest such resources in the country, if not the largest, and it supplements our 155 million person administrative claims data repository. Increasingly, we are harnessing this sophisticated data resource for advanced analytics across multiple platforms to meet growing market needs around managing the health of populations. OptumHealth reported an 11% operating margin in the third quarter with earnings from operations up 16% year-over-year. These results were led by our Collaborative Care businesses. Today, Optum touches 2 million consumers through our Collaborative Care physicians and clinical professionals who are prominent leaders in their local markets, recognized for clinical quality. As our medical groups transition to Optum technology, we further improve their execution on behalf of the patients and payers they serve, help grow their business and generate superior financial returns. More broadly within OptumHealth, we look to meaningfully improve clinical outcomes and patient well-being across multiple settings: outpatient, within institutions and in the home. We expect Optum overall revenues to be at the upper end or perhaps above our target of $45 billion to $46 billion with earnings from operations near the upper end of our previous outlook of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. Optum's future growth should continue to be strong, supported by our $7.7 billion contract revenue backlog and exceptional levels of customer pipeline activity. To summarize, 2014 performance remains consistently strong through the first 9 months, particularly considering the ACA headwinds this year. Revenues have grown year-over-year by 6%. We have increased our full year net earnings outlook to a range of $5.60 to $5.65 per share, and this earnings outlook accommodates expected fourth quarter seasonality, strong Optum performance to close the year and fourth quarter investments in growth, including strong Medicare Advantage marketing and the launch of our individual products on health exchanges in 19 new states. We expect 2014 cash flows from operations will be around $8 billion, possibly more. Our growing earnings capacity this year positions us well for 2015. At this distance, I would offer that the consensus earnings estimates for next year do a pretty good job of calibrating our 2015 outlook reflecting the combination of opportunities we expect to pursue and the challenges we expect to manage. We remain fully committed to consistent fundamental execution with the objective of realizing as much of our true potential as possible in every endeavor. We will provide details of our 2015 outlook at our Investor Conference on December 2 in the context of our long-term strategy and our opportunity to serve people and to build value. So now I'll turn this call back to our moderator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] So thank you very much. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of JPMorgan.\nJustin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: My question is on the commercial business. First, can you talk about your early view on exchange positioning in terms of products and price relative to peers, and how we should think about profit targets here given the losses in '14 that we see across the industry? And then just a quick comment on New York's small group and how we should think about over 2015 given the pushback on pricing seen from regulators.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Okay, Justin, we'll respond to your 2-part question. I will offer some perspective that we are trying to participate thoughtfully in exchanges and have not -- don't have -- have not built excessive expectations on that. I think Jeff will talk to exchanges and then maybe to New York.\nJeff Alter: Sure. Good morning, Justin. It's Jeff Alter. So on your first question or your first part of your single question on public exchanges, I would say it's keeping with our strategy that we waited to see what was going on in '14 and then are using that knowledge. It built a different platform for exchanges. So when you think about where our products are positioned, many of those products come with a network construct that's probably nontraditional to what you might expect from UnitedHealthcare. We feel good about where we're positioned. We are targeting profitability in '15, probably a little bit lower than that 3% to 5% long-term range that we've talked about but still profitable. And from what we know today, we feel pretty good about where we're positioned in many of the exchanges, particularly the largest states where we expect to grow the most. New York, I would say, nothing's changed too much in New York from the competitive environment that we -- we're in the middle of this year. The rate actions -- the rate approval actions by the regulator pretty much give us, for the most part, the same competitive marketplace in New York for 2015 that we have today. We're fortunate to have a broad portfolio of fully insured business across the country, and we're managing through some of those regulator responses right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe I could ask about Medicare Advantage. If you could just -- I realize you'll go into detail at the December 2 Investor Day, but maybe you can just talk to the scope of the benefit changes that you made and if you can characterize how they look to you at your initial look versus what the competition has put out and maybe directionally, if you think that you'll be able to grow membership and earnings next year.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, I think we feel pretty good about it. Steve, you want to comment?\nSteve Nelson: Sure. Hi, Matt, Steve Nelson. Yes, we really like our position going into 2015. Benefits shaped up about as we expected. We have -- we think we're positioned very well to grow in 2015 meaningfully at sustainable margins. Other software, we did add premiums, which was a important step to the long-term viability of this product, and -- but we are very thoughtful about that. We added premiums in markets where premiums already existed, and we added about -- to about 1/3 of our members. In 1/3 of those cases, we added 0 premium alternatives. In places where we didn't do that, we enhanced our benefits in meaningful ways that we knew based on our research would be important to seniors. So we feel very positive 1 day into open enrollment, and we expect to grow meaningfully at sustainable margins.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And the earnings growth? Sorry.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, we expect to grow earnings across the board for 2015. Actually, we think all of our businesses are really better positioned than they were as we entered into '14. And really, the underpinnings of our '15 outlook, obviously, they -- different contributions, but we're expecting growth completely across all our businesses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you talk about your expectations for cost trends going into the end of the year and then to next year and how you expect to be pricing for that cost trend for next year in the commercial side of the business?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Sure, I think Dan Schumacher will respond to this.\nDaniel Schumacher: Good morning, Peter. Thank you for the question. On the medical cost side, I'd tell you, in the quarter, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter both in aggregate as well as across each of our businesses. And frankly, it was a little bit better than we expected, and you can see that in the care ratio. You can see it in a little stronger prior-period development relative to the last couple of quarters. Each year, we set a trend expectation, respectful, mindful of underlying medical costs, and then we endeavor to outperform it, and we have strong medical cost management disciplines that we apply, and you're seeing us outperform that this year. As you look at our full year commercial cost trend for 2014, we expect to perform at the low end of our range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, possibly a little bit better. As you look into next year on the cost side, we expect similar themes, and we'll go through the specifics of that with you at the Investor Conference, but certainly, a major component of that will be unit cost, as it is every year. It represents anywhere from 2/3 to 3/4 of the underlying cost trend, and that's something that is founded on negotiations that are happening each day every day. So we've got very good line of sight on that. With respect to pricing, I'd ask Jeff Alter to comment on that.\nJeff Alter: Morning, Peter. We've had a very successful long-term pricing discipline, so nothing's changed in our philosophy. We continue, as Dan mentioned, to be very mindful of cost trend. It's the #1 driver of our premium, and we've got a lot of programs in place to outperform those medical forecasts. That's a big underlier, and there's a lot of other things that make up the price: provider network, product attributes, business mix. But we're not changing our discipline. It's been very successful for us, and we expect it to continue to be very successful for us into the future.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just to clarify, are you guys saying that you expect cost trend to be the same next year as it was this year? Or are you just saying that -- similar to this year?\nJeff Alter: Similar themes.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, Peter, similar in approach. We tend to view our costs as we enter the year. We tend to endeavor to outperform them. We continue to be -- to see medical cost trends and inflation going forward, and we position ourselves to price accordingly. All of that is completely consistent with the way we have approached the business for the last several years, no different, and we don't plan on changing that in '15.\nJohn S. Penshorn: Peter, it's John Penshorn. We'll be fully detailed on this on December 2. We're really not trying to walk through 2015 today. So I think we'll be able to fully answer that question here in just a few weeks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen.\nChristine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: You've had great growth in Medicaid, and David suggests that the expansion population's pretty young and healthy. Could you speak to where your Medicaid book of business is coming in this year and your expectations for next year with respect to that book?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, Austin, do you want to comment?\nAustin Pittman: Yes, thanks for the question. Well, first of all, we're very pleased with the growth. We are honored to have the opportunity to work with this new population, help them guide through the healthcare system. We expected higher utilization in the expansion population. In almost every case, we got paid for that higher expectation of cost, and that's what we've seen. So we expect long term for the population to perform in that 3% to 5% margin and are very confident about the continued growth.\nChristine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And what do the rates look like for that population next year and the profitability for that book directionally?\nJohn S. Penshorn: Sure. Again, we expect the rates will be appropriate for the population and support long-term sustainability. We work hand-in-hand with our states across all the markets to ensure that on an ongoing basis that that's the case, and everything seems to be showing up as we expected.\nStephen J. Hemsley: And we have long said that the margin ranges for those businesses are in a 3% to 5% zone, and that's kind of how they're playing out.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Windley of Jefferies.\nDavid H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So slightly nearer-term question. If I look at the ranges and point estimates that you've given on factors like your medical cost ratio for '14, operating costs at kind of 16, 7 and even to a lesser import, your tax rate, it would seem that one or more of those would need to trend below what you've most recently said to get to your guidance range. I'm wondering which of those I should focus on as performing better, if you could elaborate, please.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Well, my reaction to that question is I would stand back and look at the totality of the business. If you take a look at the spectrum of UnitedHealth Group, and that's who we are speaking to, you have the continued performance of the Optum business. We have a very strong Medicaid business in terms of its growth. We have an international business that we think will make a meaningful contribution going into next year. We have been historically very strong in our operating cost disciplines and have structured those programs for across the expanse of our businesses. I think we have nice momentum coming in our Medicare business and our commercial business. So I wouldn't lay it out to one factor or try to basically triangulate on a ratio that, really, when you have a business as diversified and as expansive as this one. So that's why I think that that's perhaps the perspective you should look at as into '15.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.\nSarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Optum's always been a source of growth. But this quarter, it really seem to stand out particularly in growth in the external revenue for OptumInsight as well as improvements in the OptumRx margins. Maybe you touched on it briefly in the prepared, but I was hoping you could dig in a little bit further and talk about some of the programs you have in place driving that and how we should think about the potential of continued improvements there.\nStephen J. Hemsley: We'd be pleased to. Larry, can you start that off?\nLarry C. Renfro: Sure. Sarah, it's Larry Renfro. Let me break it into 3 areas, and I think it'll -- we'll get -- as John has said many times, we'll get more into detail about this at the Investor Conference, but this might help you get ready for the Investor Conference. Obviously, last year, at the previous Investor Conference and into this year, we've been talking about investing in the future, especially in OptumHealth and in OptumInsight. We had that all planned, and we've absorbed, obviously, the impact, and all of our financials are in line as we continue to finish off the investment or the development in these new programs. I think in the third quarter, you saw that OptumHealth went to a 14% top line growth and 16% bottom line growth year-over-year. You also saw that the OptumInsight went 4% up on the top line and 6% up on the bottom line. So what you're starting to see is what we said would happen during the year that our investments are starting to tail off, and as a result, really, our outcomes are starting to kick in. So we believe that, that will create a strong fourth quarter as Steve referenced in his remarks. The second part of this answer is that we are obviously going after 10 large accounts that we have identified that we would do by 2016. We have probably as many sales metrics as we do financial metrics in Optum, so we are in line with all those sales metrics as we go forward. I'd say, too, that you might want to look at that would really tell you something would be our backlog. That backlog is at $7.7 billion, up 20 -- 21% year-over-year, and our sales pipeline, that's up 166% year-over-year. So that's the second part of the answer. The third part on the growth would be the 5 areas of focus that we're really concentrating on now, and this would be in the future as well. That's medical groups, Optum360, the PBM, international and the government business. So I think that if you kind of go back to the question you asked, I think we're pretty well positioned for growth, and we're pretty much hitting on all these programs.\nSarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division: Got it. And just a follow-up, the margin improvement in OptumRx, should we think about this as being the new bar for that segment? Or is there further upside from this?\nLarry C. Renfro: So OptumRx had a great quarter. And I think if you go back to this, what we were talking about a few minutes ago in terms of investing in the future, that's what we did a couple of years ago when we built a platform and started the process of moving the business in health. That's been a great move on our part. What I would say is what the margin really does is validate the guidance that we've been giving, that 3% to 4%, and I think we'll expand upon that more at Investor Day.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Dirk, you want to add anything?\nDirk C. McMahon: Yes. Sarah, it's Dirk. What I would say is if you look at the third quarter, the major driver of the better margin was things that we did in executing a direct purchasing acquisition strategy. Really, at the gross margin line is where we have favorable uptick in the quarter...\nStephen J. Hemsley: And those should be sustainable.\nDirk C. McMahon: Correct. And as Larry said, we'll stick with 3% to 4% in the long term op margin perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nRalph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: In the release in your prepared, you suggested and talked about sort of retrained utilization, and obviously, the MLR performance would suggest that as well. Just hoping you can maybe provide a little bit more on specific inpatient and maybe outpatient metrics, if you're seeing any change on sort of QE [ph] levels. Any measurements there would be helpful. And then just last quarter, you said MLR would track at the higher end of guidance. Is that still the case?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, we don't actually ever get into those kinds -- that level of granular statistics, but I think we can give you some commentary to give you some sense.\nDaniel Schumacher: Sure. Good morning, Ralph, this is Dan Schumacher. On utilization, specifically, as we've mentioned, we continue to see very stable trends across our businesses, which is to say that we see the same comparable increases in 2014 as compared to 2013. As you look at the componentry underneath it, obviously, pharmacy is higher in the hep C category, and that's being offset -- more than offset by better performance in inpatient, in particular, followed by physician and outpatient. Our medical cost management plays a very significant role in this. As I've said earlier, we do set expectations and then endeavor to outperform them, and we're doing that this year. I think some of the other things that are probably contributing to the performance in utilization is certainly some greater consumer responsibility and higher concentrations of value-based reimbursement, and again, those are things that are a significant focus of our enterprise. So overall, very stable utilization pattern. I think, perhaps, people ask how do we know, and looking at external data and so forth, and I'll tell you, as Steve said in the prepared remarks, you look at -- we have 41,000 people in any given day in a facility, and we have 2,000 people, they wake up every morning, and they look at who's going to be admitted, who has been admitted, how long they've been there, what they're being treated for, and most importantly, working with them, their family and their caregivers on appropriate discharge plan so that they can be successful when they leave. And all of that is enabled by near realtime technology, and we're going to have an opportunity to show that to you at the Investor Conference. So that's what we're seeing on the utilization front.\nRalph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, thanks, and then just MLR guidance?\nLarry C. Renfro: MLR guidance, again, I think we'd reiterate comments from last quarter, which is to say we'd expect to be near the higher end of the range on both the consolidated and the commercial ratios, albeit a little bit better than what we were thinking leaving the second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of UBS.\nAlbert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Maybe just to ask you about the international business. It looks like there's acceleration in top line performance at Amil this quarter. I know there were some issues around government changes down there and utilization and so forth. Are you pretty much back to where you want it to be at a normalized operating trend? And then more broadly, I guess you guys have been mentioned in several international sales situations. Can you comment on your appetite for international deals at this point and whether your thinking's evolved in what you might or might not do?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, we are basically coming around the bend on a full year in terms of the changes in Brazil, and I think that they are -- we see some pretty positive sense in terms of that marketplace. And I'll have Dave comment on that and the others.\nDavid S. Wichmann: Thanks, A.J. Thanks for the question. I think what you're noticing in Amil is what we notice as well, is it's beginning to show tangible results from the various initiatives that we put in place largely in response to this ANS regulatory change, which happened just over 1 year ago. As you know, there was a lag on the market's ability to respond to that change. So one of the things we had to do was ensure that all of our plans were in good standing, get our renewals up, and so even in the face of declining membership, which is largely around dealing with high costs of block of business, if you will, we are showing strong revenue growth, which is largely a reflection of the activities we have underway with respect to getting renewals in place in response to that regulatory change. We're also pursuing managing our costs, and they're coming out, and we're making, I think, all the right changes to the business, and notably, our hospitals continue to perform very well as well. So it will take some time, A.J., to work our way through this. It will be maybe all the way to the end of '15 till we get to what I would characterize as a more normalized level of profitability in the business, but we clearly see line of sight towards that. As it relates to the international markets and our appetite there, yes, we are active predominately in Brazil, predominantly in the healthcare delivery space, predominantly in the long lines that I described before, which is to move beyond the centers of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro into the contiguous cities, if you will, and then also to pursue growth in the Northeast part of that country. Our efforts there have gone very well. And then, of course, we have other interests internationally, but I'd say most of those are aimed towards the South America and Latin American markets. And then as we think about more broadly across the globe as well as in those 2 markets, we see great opportunity for Optum, which we are just beginning to pursue.\nOperator: Next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays.\nJoshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to take a step back just on the benefits business and the M&A landscape, and it's been, I think, 2 years now since there's been any major M&A on the benefit side, and it's been even longer for United. So I'm just curious, is there a reason for this pause? Is there something in the market that changed with reform? Is it just an unsure landscape as to who the winners and the losers are in some of the benefits business? Just maybe your perspectives on M&A, maybe even broadly beyond UNH, just in the benefit segment specifically.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Yes, I'll just comment that, perhaps, the highest levels certainly with the healthcare reform efforts that have been going forward, I could easily see this marketplace being fairly occupied in making sure that this is -- everybody in this space that they are prepared to and responding to the changing regulatory landscape and to make sure that they're pursuing the opportunities and managing the challenges that those regulatory changes brought forward. And I think that it continues to go forward. I think it's been a very successful first year across the industry in terms of how that has been responded to.\nJoshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And when are you left occupied with those responses?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Well, I think my view is that this year was, by far, the most amount of changes, but they're going to have to be digested in the marketplace over the next 2 to 3 years. But I would not necessarily suggest then that there'll be a time when there will be market activities around M&A -- begin to pick up and so forth. I'm not sure I would necessarily -- when we take a look at the expanse of our business, we are well diversified across our benefits business, continue to be interested in growing that and making sure it continues to innovate and drive value from an organic point of view and to be in a position that where we see opportunities to expand that business that makes sense, that lie into our strategic path, that bring capabilities, that bring market positions or scale. That we will -- we would have an interest, and I would imagine others will as well. We have opportunities to also allocate capital to services and to international markets, and we will have to assess those as well. So I don't think it's -- my sense is that it requires a little bit more thoughtful reflection than just when will the reform run its course or not. And I think that I'm impressed that across the space, the businesses have been mature in terms of how they responded, and I think everybody is focused at the opportunities at hand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.\nScott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just to add 2 quick ones, just first, how much of the $200 million and the targeted Optum investment spend has now been completed through the 3Q? And how much remains for the fourth quarter? And then just secondly, just I know it's very small for you guys in the overall context of things, but just interested on Texas Medicaid. That's been one of the states that has still been reticent to cover the industry fee. And we've heard some mixed feedback from different plans on whether they expect to get paid on that or not. So definitely very interested in whether you've heard something from Texas on whether you're going to get recouped for the industry fee this year.\nStephen J. Hemsley: So that will go from one side to the other. So John, you want to respond to the first?\nJohn Rex: Yes. Scott, John Rex here. So yes, correct. We've talked in the first half about the investments that we've been making, particularly within the OptumInsight and OptumHealth businesses, and we sized that up in the first half at $140 million, talked about $200 million or more for the full year in terms of anticipating in investing those businesses. So in the 3Q, we would have invested an additional $60 million, so we hit our $200 million. I do anticipate that we will continue to spend in the fourth quarter, albeit, at a diminished rate. However, that is within the scope of our guidance where we've talked about our comfort with the high end of our $3.2 billion earnings range.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Austin?\nAustin Pittman: Sure, thanks for the question. I guess, first of all, I'd comment that we had great progress, as you know, in getting arrangements and agreements in place with our states on the recovery of this fee. There is one instance, as you mentioned, that we don't have written agreement yet. We do expect to be paid. We expect all of these to come in before the end of the year. We haven't recorded revenue in that one instance, but we feel very good overall.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.\nKevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple quick questions on the individual exchange business. I want to clarify something first. You said that you expect it to be slightly below kind of the longer-term margin in that business of 3% to 5%. But I think in the past, you've talked about pricing that business to profitability kind of excluding the 3 Rs, not relying on them to make a profit. And I would think that if you are pricing that way, then with the 3 Rs, you would be at least at the -- that average number. So I just want to clarify that before a follow-up on the exchanges.\nJeff Alter: Kevin, it's Jeff Alter. Yes, so we're not exclusive of all of these Rs, so we would not rely on corridors. We will, obviously, rely on the reinsurance and the risk adjustment. Risk adjustment is a big part of it. So while we will get into that 3%, probably closer to the 5% as the market matures, we also recognize that it's still a market in development, and our competitors that are already in the marketplace, we need to be able to come in at a price point that attracts a little bit of growth but still profitability, and then build into that marketplace. So this is a long-term build for us but -- so just clarifying, we will not rely on corridors, but the other Rs are important parts of that business, and risk adjustment will always be an important part of that.\nKevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So is this a clarification then or is this something that now that you've seen the pricing and everything else that it's a little bit different? Or -- I just wasn't sure.\nGail Koziara Boudreaux: Kevin, this is Gail Boudreaux. I just want to sort of add on to Jeff's comment about what he said. I mean, it's not so much a clarification. It's always been our long-term strategy. We see this market as a really good growth -- long-term growth opportunity. As we said in the last several calls, we don't expect to rely on subsidies as part of that, and we are pricing to profitability. But in any new market, as you enter a market, we don't necessarily think that we'll see our 3% to 5% earnings range in the first year. And again, remember, 75% of this market has yet to develop, and we are seeing it firm and stabilize a little bit, but it's still only the second year in the market. But overall, we went into this market with an expectation of earning a profit in it.\nKevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, because that was going to be my real question, was just how do you think the [indiscernible] market is going to evolve in 2015? I mean, do you think the CBO target of $13 million makes sense? And then how do you think about your positioning as, I guess, a strong second mover versus the incumbents? I mean, in retrospect, if you had known that membership would be 7.3 million, would you have been more aggressive in year 1? Or I guess just any thoughts there.\nStephen J. Hemsley: No, no. We like where we are, or we would have played this just exactly as we have. We think the second vintage will be better. The third vintage will be better after that. This market will form. It will be different market by market. It will take time for it to evolve. It will eventually evolve into about the profit margin range that we have been discussing. We're not going to comment on CBO. We have no idea from that point of view whose projections are correct. So far, all we can say is everybody's projections have been wrong. And so we will just play this and participate as we see this market evolve, which has been completely consistent with our perspective on this, and we do anticipate too that we will participate in this a way that is sustainable from a growth and profitability point of view, but we don't have that kind of mature margin assumption in your first couple years of participation, and we really don't have a lot of this into our 15-year outlook, but this is really just our introduction. We expect to participate. We expect to grow, but we're not expecting tremendous profit out of that first year participation. So I think that's ought to be the way you think about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.\nAndrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So one of your peers just pulled out of the Delaware Medicaid program over a rate disagreement. I believe you're the only other MCO in the program. So first of all, do you expect to enroll the 130 members next year? And then more broadly, how are your rate discussions going for Medicaid next year in the areas of pushback on rates?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Austin?\nAustin Pittman: This is Austin. Thanks for the question. We do have an agreement in place with Delaware. We look forward to continuing to serve the people of Delaware and stay focused on being ready to do that. I won't speculate on -- at this early date on where that membership will play out, but overall, we continue to feel confident in our relationships with our states, our ability and proven track record in working with states to really serve those populations and deliver that long-term sustainability in that 3% to 5% margin.\nStephen J. Hemsley: And the states see value in that. These are complex programs. They're invested in them, and Medicaid programs are continuing to establish themselves very well.\nAustin Pittman: Yes, I think the great growth that we've seen this year and our ability to work year-over-year with states is a reflection of the trust they've put in us to serve their populations.\nStephen J. Hemsley: And I think Medicaid has been one of the strong successes of the ACA effort.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners.\nAna Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division: The question's on the employer market and mix shift potentially in 2015 given the data points of Walmart, which dumped, I think, 30,000 workers. Some of your competitors are talking about small group under 10 dumping into exchanges. But on the flip side, the private exchange market and adoption's been slower from the recent [indiscernible] data points, and there's an employer mandate 1/1/2015. So are you looking at '15 as a big year of mix shift? And is there potential for disproportionate share gains for you because the band stickiness is not that great? And what are you assuming in your soft 2015 EPS guide of kind of in line with consensus?\nStephen J. Hemsley: That's quite a question. Gail, do you want to start?\nGail Koziara Boudreaux: Sure. That is quite a question. There's a number of things embedded. Let me first talk about the mix shift question you had, and take it in a couple of parts. The first, let me deal with your question on small employer dumping. We don't -- we have not seen a lot of that. We don't really expect an acceleration in that given how reform has laid out in some of the offerings that are still in the marketplace. So I don't expect any significant increase in dumping, although we do expect some decline in the mark, which has been happening over time but not a significant dumping. In terms of the overall market, you mentioned employers getting rid of or taking down their part-time employees. Let me start with our expectations around the large marketplace. Overall, the national account marketplace has been -- we feel positive about that marketplace. We're pleased with our competitive position in it, and we do expect better results in '14 than in '13. We had a stronger close ratio. But with that, getting to your second question, we do have a very focused strategy when there's an opportunity in exchanges to help convert some of our self-funded business to fully insure the exchanges, and we are seeing some of that, which comes out of our commercial enrollment. And the other sector of the market that's happening is the retiree population is moving from the self-funded book of business, particularly in our national accounts, to our Medicare advantage, our Medicare supplement and our Part D products. And again, we've been very successful in that in '14, and we expect to be successful in '15. That's been a very specific strategy. So those are the kind of changes going on in the market, and we feel good about our positioning in that.\nStephen J. Hemsley: I'd say just the expanse, the diversification of our benefits offerings suggest that even if there are shifts in the marketplace, we're really well positioned to accommodate those shifts and I think pretty agile in that context.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.\nCarl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: On the cost trend, so sub 5% last year, a little bit under 5.5% this year. Can you walk through what's accounting for that, call it, 50 basis point increase this year versus 2013?\nDaniel Schumacher: Sure, Carl, this is Dan Schumacher. One of the primary elements of the increase year-over-year is reform related. We talked about that at the investor conference last December, that as people moved into richer plans complied with community rating and so forth that was one of the elements that -- principal elements that drove the increase.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Thank you. So I think we will close, and as we close today, I'd like to remind you that 2014 performance across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare remains strong through the first 9 months of the year, and we expect to continue that consistent performance through the rest of 2014 and to remain in line with or ahead of our outlook that we shared with you today. And in 2015 and beyond, we expect our overall business performance will further strengthen and accelerate both top line and bottom line. And we look forward to sharing more detail with you around 2015 performance at the Investor Conference on December 2 in New York. So thank you for your attention today. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.

I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here's some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 17, 2014, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we will review our first half 2014 performance within the context of the goals we set for this year and the opportunities we see going forward. We see the next 18 months as important given that by January 2016 the ACA will largely be in place and we will be entering an election cycle that will set the stage for shaping the next phases of health reforms. For decades, the trend has been for greater private sector engagement in meeting ever increasing national healthcare needs. These include the foundation of what is today Medicare Advantage, the launch of Medicare Part D drug benefits, the formation of accountable care organizations, steady migration of Medicaid to managed care, the expansion of benefit coverage to the uninsured under ACA exchanges and expanded Medicaid programs and the improvements to the healthcare.gov and many state based exchanges. UnitedHealth Group businesses have participated strongly in each of these developments and we remain focused on making these efforts successful and sustainable as they continue to evolve and settle into the fabric of our national healthcare system. We continue to execute steadily on that change agenda and we believe an improving environment in 2016 and beyond will support acceleration on our earnings growth rate. This morning, we are raising our 2014 revenue outlook to $130 billion from the previous forecasts of $128 billion to $129 billion. We are strengthening our 2014 earnings projection to a tighter range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share. The increasing earnings momentum we expect in the second half of 2014 should position us to grow both revenues and earnings per share in 2015. Advancing our performance in this 18 month timeframe will remain challenging but achievable, anchored by strong Medicaid growth, steadily strengthening Medicare and international performance, deeper entry into new, more established public exchange markets and continuing strong growth and earnings momentum at Optum. These elements are visible as well in second quarter results reported today. In the second half of 2014, UnitedHealth Group grew revenues 7% to $32.6 billion and earned $1.42 per share. Optum contributed nearly 30% of our enterprise operating earnings this quarter. Solid cash flows from operations of $1 billion for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the first half of the year were approximately one times net income, in line with our 2013 patterns. As our strongest cash flows come in the back half of the year, we continue to project a range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion in cash flows for full year 2014. Reviewing our results in more detail, starting with UnitedHealthcare. Second quarter revenues grew 6% year-over-year to $30.1 billion. The quarter featured earnings from operations of $1.8 billion, driven by a strong operating margin of 6.1% even with the growing mix of public and senior sector businesses. UnitedHealthcare is seeing significant and accelerating growth in Medicaid. 380,000 more people in the quarter and 635,000 through the first half of the year. Coming from expanded access to Medicaid in about half the states we serve, the launch of Florida's planned Medicaid expansion, and core program growth from already established markets and programs. In Medicare, we grew to serve more than 400,000 more people across all products in the first half of 2014. A very solid and balanced performance considering the market actions we needed to take last year in response to reduced Medicare program funding from CMS. In the core senior medical products of Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental benefits, we have grown the number of seniors we serve each year for than a decade and this year should be no exception. There is no question the private sector provides significant value to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare has been and will continue to be a growth business at UnitedHealthcare. We are privileged to serve one out of every five American seniors. Today we serve 3 million people in Medicare Advantage plans and 12 million across all product types. We expect to deliver overall Medicare growth for years to come, driven by favorable demographic trends and our strong local market cost and value positions, supported by deeply integrated Optum resources in pharmacy services, primary care delivery, health calls, data analytics and compliance. Our Medicare Advantage business works with senior focused care providers under rising levels of well designed shared risk and performance based payment arrangements to deliver more effective clinical management in concert with well-targeted and executed home visits. From the seniors' perspective, we offer market leading access to quality care across a broad spectrum of venues combined with the attractive benefits under strong brands with convenient broad-based distribution. Commercial membership continued to track with recent trends. Pulling back in risk-based products as we remain focused on pricing discipline and endeavoring to strike the right balance in protecting margin and giving back some past growth. In self-funded products, our momentum is steadily strengthening. We are winning national account business and retaining key customers we are privileged to serve. We are pleased to return to serve as a core benefit option in the State of Georgia in 2015. Customers are still announcing final decisions and our pipeline is much stronger than this time last year. We feel positive about our January 2015 position at this early stage. In the individual market, we plan to grow next year as we expand our offerings to as many two dozen state exchanges. This approach is consistent with our long stated plan to take a prudent first year position and then build and expand in 2015 and 2016 as these markets become more established. By participating moderately this year and then watching closely and listening, we have learned about pricing, networks, regulatory structures, distribution and the consumers mindset regarding public exchanges. These data points help and form our positioning for 2015 which should be a better risk vintage for the public exchanges. We believe public exchange markets must be sustainable on their own, so our participation will not overly rely on risk corridors or assumptions under risk sharing provisions. The Congressional budget office estimates that more than 75% of the exchange market is yet to develop. And we believe there will likely be meaningful membership activity in the market after the initial experience of this year and as second year pricing is presented. So we plan to grow steadily from this point forward, advancing our participation in a measured manner in public exchanges in 2015, 2016 and beyond. Bringing together this year's developments across these various product categories, our original forecast for U.S. consumers served is proving fairly accurate in total with greater incremental losses in full risk commercial benefits which we discussed last quarter, offset by exceptional growth in Medicaid which should come in well in excess of 800,000 people this year. Turning to Brazil. Amil has seen clear signs of steady recovery from a surge in utilization beginning in the last half of 2013 in response to aggressive, new government mandated access standards. Our premium rates are improving and are catching up to the increased levels of medical services. We are deploying capital to continue building out Amil's franchises in to Rio, Sao Paulo in northeastern Brazilian market, which nicely benefitted our membership numbers this quarter with 110,000 net growth. In our view, Brazil remains the most fertile market for health benefits and services outside the U.S. and we expect our focus and efforts in this large, high potential market will reward our shareholders for years to come. At UnitedHealthcare, we continue to project a 6% commercial medical cost trend, plus or minus 50 basis points for 2014. Our medical costs remain inline with our plan and remain moderate. The consolidated medical care ratio for the second quarter was 81.6%, 10 basis points higher than last year despite less reserve development and a shift in the mix of our business towards government programs resulting in upward pressure in the ratio year-over-year. These factors were mostly offset by 100 basis point reduction from the implementation of billing of the ACA fees and taxes. Second quarter results were led by the public and senior sector where revenues from federal and state based programs continued to develop positively. Public and senior sector earnings are running slightly favorable to our original 2014 outlook. We are constructively supporting innovative ways to universally improve the quality and affordability of healthcare for consumers. In one example, we and several other healthcare companies are collaborating with the not-for-profit Healthcare Cost Institute to develop and provide free access to online healthcare transparency tools that offer consumers the most comprehensive and accurate information about the price and quality of healthcare services so individuals can make more informed decisions about their health and healthcare. HCCI's transparency tool will be available in January 2015 and HCCI plans to advance more free services for consumers and other key healthcare stakeholders in the quarters and years to come. Last fall we took a more intense focus on improving our Medicare stars performance for Medicare Advantage. We made changes in people, organizational alignment, business processes and funding and resource allocation which we believe are yielding positive results. We project our stars performance for 2015 payment year will be better than expected and will steadily improve in 2016 over 2015 and even more meaningfully in 2017 and '18, creating a steady, multiyear upwards progression. Our commitment is to maintain a baseline of no fewer than 80% of our seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans rated four stars or higher every year. At Optum, we are tracking to deliver record revenues and profits again this year, driven by market demand for our broad portfolio of capabilities and solutions. Second quarter results are on plan with Optum's margins on course to strengthen again in 2014. We expect margins will reach approximately 7% this year even as our pharmacy services business grows at an accelerated pace. These advances are consistent with our original forecast last fall and Optum's 8% by 2016 commitment. We remain focused on building a scalable, end-to-end services platform. Healthcare system participants are beset with more complex challenges then they have ever faced. Their needs have grown well beyond the standalone product offerings that are characteristic of this fragmented market. Optum has integrated services and capabilities to better meet and anticipate the emerging needs of the market, whether around advanced analytics and population health, deeply integrating pharmacy and medical management for more effectively delivering and documenting clinical care. These markets each represent multibillion dollar growth opportunities unified for customers in a flexible, modern comprehensive and fully scaled services platform. The growth in revenue, backlog and pipeline and the increasing number of larger, deeper and more sophisticated Optum relationships demonstrates steady progress in converting these opportunities into revenues and provides visibility and near-term growth and an indication of strong long-term future we see for this business. At the same time, Optum continues to have opportunities to improve its basic operating performance. We continue to better integrate and align internally, focusing on delivering higher value products and services with greater efficiency, better leveraging resources and competencies and information analytics, technology and clinical care, and improving our cost structure and operational efficiency. These efforts are equally important to achieving our long-term earnings goals. Continued investment remains central to Optum's long-term growth. The quarter carried $80 million in investment costs as we deepened capabilities in areas such as consumer engagement tools and distribution services, next generation analytics that uniquely combine administrative and clinical data at scale, next generation medical care review and compliance analytics and services and international versions of product and services that have become established here in the U.S. We will be investing startup costs in major Optum360 relationships and Optum technology outsourcing arrangements and moving forward on services focused to the needs of targeted international markets. These investments continue throughout the year but should have less noticeable effects on results in the fourth quarter of 2014 as Optum's overall growth and performance accelerates and we benefit from the impact of the more seasonal businesses. In the second quarter, Optum's revenues grew 28% to $11.7 billion. Earnings from operations grew 23% year-over-year to $728 million. Operating margins declined slightly to 6.2% due to the planned investments just discussed and the exceptional growth of the OptumRx business. OptumRx again led this quarter's performance. Revenues grew 42%. Earnings from operations doubled while operating margins expanded a full percentage point to 3.6%. We process more than 150 million adjusted scripts this quarter, up 30% year-over-year. Our cost to fill a mail order script decreased 30% over the past year and we expect to drive increased consumer value through higher volumes of mail order business. We had exceeded our goal of 1 million new consumers served from business awards a spectrum of customers in 2014 and have some early awards in hands for 2015 with good a prospect pipeline. This growth is additive to the natural organic growth led by the in-sourcing of UnitedHealthcare's pharmacy business over the past two years. OptumInsight's growth was again led by strong performance in government sponsored services. OptumInsight is providing services to five separate state exchanges in addition to its continuing role with the federal exchange. By the midyear point, computer-assisted coding offerings from our Optum360 Revenue Management Organization were installed in more than 50 customers who operate more than 220 facilities. And the pipeline continues to grow. On the downside, the regulatory pullback in hospital, clinical compliance services continues and has pressures revenues and earnings for that product offering. And at OptumHealth, we are continuing to build out our local care delivery organization. Today our physicians and clinical professionals touch 2 million consumes with high levels of clinical quality to our local clinics, which are prominent leaders in their market. All in, Optum delivered an exceptional second quarter and first half with improved earnings and capital returns compared to a very strong prior year. We expect Optum's earnings to accelerate in the second half of 2014, especially in the fourth quarter as they have in the past years. Driven by strong revenue growth, achieving performance incentives from customers, the accumulating benefits of operational efficiencies and structural cost efforts, and favorable seasonal patterns at OptumInsight and OptumHealth. Optum remains on page to contribute roughly one-third of UnitedHealth Group's 2014 cash flows from operations, all while investing in future growth of this business. To summarize, the first half of the year was strong with revenues growing by $3.5 billion or 6% year-over-year. First half earnings of $2.52 per share position us positively for the full year growth. With a strong second half growth performance from Optum and seasonal strength in UnitedHealthcare's second half operating margins, expected to help accelerate our earnings and bring us to a strong close. We see 2014 revenues at about $130 billion and net earnings in the range of $5.50 to $5.60 per share, with cash flows from operations in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion. We are intensely focused on continuing to execute evermore sharply on the details and fundamentals in every aspect of our businesses and in everything we do for the people we serve. We will provide a full view of our 2015 expectations at our annual investors conference in New York City on Tuesday, December 2nd. So thank you for your time this morning and we will now take your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of JP Morgan.\nJustin Lake - JP Morgan: Questions on medical cost trends. I know you indicated trends inline overall, but given the recent data points out there, I was hoping you might have some color to share in terms of real time Rx trends, hospital discharge planners etcetera. And then just a quick follow up on your Medicare Advantage comments in the prepared remarks. Is it reasonable to expect you are in a position to grow membership here for 2015. Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Yes. So Dan Schumacher, you want to comment. I don\u2019t know if we can get into that level of detail but I think we can add some color.\nDaniel Schumacher: Sure. Good morning, Justin. This is Dan. With respect to the costs, obviously in the quarter we were very pleased with our medical cost performance. And as Steve mentioned, our underlying cost trends remain very well controlled. We continue to make improvements in our medical cost management and a lot of that, honestly, is in strong partnership with Optum. Whether it be payment integrity, local care delivery, our partnership with OptumRx and so forth. And so as Steve mentioned, on the full year we still expect our cost trend to be in the 6% plus or minus 50 basis range. We would like to expect that to be closer to the lower end of that range. With regards to what's happening in the quarter and our early data, nothing would suggest that we are seeing any kind of surge. So as we look at daily hospital census data, as we look at prior authorization for outpatient and inpatient procedures, pharmacy fulfillment, all of those things wouldn\u2019t point to any sort of surge in the quarter.\nStephen Hemsley: Gail, (indiscernible) now if you want to talk about MA.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Good morning, Justin. This is Gail Boudreaux. In terms of your question on Medicare Advantage. First of all, we really alike our position around Medicare and feel that the work that we have done over the past year has put us in a good position. So overall we are looking to grow. We will provide you a lot more detail obviously at our investor conference but we do feel that the work around network product positioning value has put us in a good place and I feel positive about Medicare.\nStephen Hemsley: Do you want to add anything?\nUnidentified Participant: I think you said it well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs: I was hoping maybe you could talk about the -- what you are seeing in the pricing environment as an update from last quarter in the traditional commercial risk business and maybe not relative to the 280,000 commercial risk lives that lapsed during the quarter.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure, Jeff?\nJeff Alter: Good morning, Matt. It's Jeff Alter. Really nothing has changed in the pricing environment that we discussed in the first quarter. The pressure remains in mainly New York and a couple of other small group markets. You know I would just remind you that a part of that, or a large part of that 280,000 member loss which related to our individual footprint. We had mentioned in our investor conference that we were going to lose individual business throughout the year because of our pullback in a lot of markets. And I think we are beginning to see changes and some good momentum in other parts of our business, other than those few pressured markets. And as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks, really encouraged by the national account season and then our win back of the State of Georgia and couple of other larger public sector accounts.\nMatthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Has your view changed at all with respect to -- you are looking at 2015 being a quiet year for contract changes?\nJohn Rex: Matt, could you clarify what type, I am not following. It's John Rex.\nMatthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Well, I think that the question earlier in the year had been, with 2015 are you going to see significant carrier switching, particularly for the large accounts that renew on a calendar year basis. And I think you had said, you thought it was going to be a relatively quiet year for that. Now with your backlog increasing, has that view changed at all?\nGail Boudreaux: This is Gail. In terms of your question, a couple of things. Steve mentioned in the comments and I think Jeff reiterated, in the large case market we feel pretty positive about what we are seeing in that marketplace and the momentum we have. You saw we just won the State of Georgia back, which I think is another positive. In terms of in-year switching, we are very pleased with the pieces that we locked in as part of last year and that provides us a nice long-term run rate. So overall, and we see there are some positive emerging dynamics, but again, we are early into this cycle right now so I don\u2019t want to comment for next year but I think it's pretty consistent with what we have said on the last call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.\nPeter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo: Your guidance for commercial loss ratio back in December was 79.2, plus or minus 50 bps. You noted on the first quarter call that the pressure from SOVALDI and the New York pricing market was pressuring the overall consolidated loss ratio towards the higher end of the 80.5, plus or minus 50 bps, but never, I think, specifically noted what the impact was on the commercial loss ratio. So it's hard to tell right now whether the commercial loss ratio is trending about where you expected it to be or is it more worse than you expected it to be. Especially since it looks like there is some gains from favorable revenue adjustments on the government business. Can you talk to sort of the puts and takes relative to the Medicare business -Medicaid business, and the commercial loss ratio relative to your expectations?\nStephen Hemsley: So I will have Dan answer that, but that\u2019s quite a question so we will kind of do it in a summarized form\nDaniel Schumacher: Sure. Thanks, Peter. So obviously in the first quarter we talked about both our consolidated loss ratio and the implications underneath that our commercial loss ratio would be near the higher end of the range that we had provided at investor day. And as we look at the second quarter in light of that revised expectation, we see things tracking well. So our commercial business is tracking in line with those expectations coming out of the first quarter and we are doing a little bit better in the government business on the care ratio.\nPeter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo: And can you specifically say what the revenue impacts were from the favorable true-ups in the revenue development in the government business?\nDaniel Schumacher: I am not going to share specifically the revenue developments but just to provide a little bit more color on the revenue developments. They are not something that -- they are not uncommon for us, particularly in the second quarter. And so what you are seeing is a combination of finalization of our 2013 Medicare revenue that has pulled through to our 2014 estimates and we also have true-ups in our state based programs. So we have got true-ups obviously related to the industry fee as we get that, as well as normal retroactive rate adjustments. So all of those things are representatives out there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays\nJosh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital: So just getting back on Medicare Advantage. I appreciate the comments that Gail made around, you guys will look to grow in 2015 and you look your positioning. So is that indicative, I guess it's sort of a two parter so I will admit I am cheating upfront. Are you done with provider renegotiations and network work? And then I guess more importantly, is Medicare Advantage a growth business from an operating earnings perspective next year?\nStephen Hemsley: Steve Nelson, why don\u2019t you respond to that?\nSteve Nelson: Sure. First in terms of just overall positioning. Our Medicare Advantage business as Gail mentioned, we really like the performance so far and we have made quite an investment in stars, in our clinical programs and network. And these things have to work together in order for this to continue to be a growth business for us. And so in terms of network specifically, we have done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of shaping our network and concentrating our numbers with high quality and highly engaged providers. That work will continue but I would say in kind of a, more of a different format. We are going to be working more with providers inside our network to further concentrate that membership and expand our ACO footprint, engage more heavily in capitation and other kinds of value based contracting within our existing network, as opposed to actually reducing the number of providers. So it's a little bit of shift towards working with providers already on our network but working closely with our network and shaping it and focusing it in this way as it's going to part of an ongoing process and really important as we continue to improve our stars, our clinical performance and our member satisfaction.\nStephen Hemsley: I think we are very positive on this. We have taken the steps that were necessary and they were the most disruptive and I think at this point forward we are now positioning this business in a way for good long-term sustainable growth, star compliance. And so while we have continued to be working on this, we are very positive about where this base will go.\nJosh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital: So to recap, you are not making -- so all of the heavy lifting and the big changes around providers and things that really impact the member, that\u2019s kind of behind us. The rest of it's going to be kind of behind the scenes, more capitation the better. So I know that\u2019s what gives you comfort on the member side but is it also fair to say that, okay, from that perspective it sounds like you are getting a more efficient network and that earnings growth should be and you sort of reset margins over the last couple of years that it's more conceivable to see earnings contributions from that segment as well?\nStephen Hemsley: So I think you're fine on all those levels. I do think that we have to be attentive to Medicare Advantage funding levels because that has been a pressure point and so forth. But in terms of the things that would be disruptive to the business, Steve, I think those have run the course....\nSteve Nelson: Yes, I think you summarized it well. And we think the earnings range for the government business we have talked about for us, between 3% and 5%. And we are in that range this year and we will continue to be in that range. That\u2019s our view and I am obviously not giving specific guidance for next year but more to come. But that\u2019s how we think about it. Really great performance and I am excited about the competitive positioning looking forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.\nSarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities: I was hoping you could provide some color on utilization levels of the newly insured? And it would be really helpful if you could break that out to the newly insured on the Medicaid side, so would work or expansion members versus the commercial side, the exchange members that were previously uninsured?\nStephen Hemsley: We will. And now keep in mind we have a very low profile in exchange, but Gail and team, you want to respond?\nGail Boudreaux: Sure, good morning, Sarah. Steve -- first let me reiterate what Steve said around the public exchange membership. We have got a very modest footprint there so I wouldn't draw any conclusions from our early experience in that sector. On the Medicaid side as you've seen we've gotten tremendous growth. We're really pleased with it. We did expect to see increases in utilization and we also got higher rate sales for that and it's tracking very much in line with the expectations we had. So overall, I think very much in line and we're, again, extremely pleased by the growth that we are seeing not just across the expansion but new states wins as well as expansion of our current existing membership footprint.\nSarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities: And can you just clarify, I think you guys mentioned you're not relying on three R's for 2015. Does that also mean your guidance assumes no receivables for 2014 for the three R's?\nDaniel Schumacher: Sarah, it's Dan. On the three R's, we have nothing on corridors and risk adjustment and we have very modest reinsurance that\u2019s assumed recovery, that's immaterial.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck - Bank of America: One quick clarification before I get in to main question. Did you say Steve that you have expected 2015 stars to be better than expected? I didn\u2019t quite understand that comment.\nStephen Hemsley: Yes. We are expecting to track progress in 2015 and build progress from that in '16, '17, '18. So we are committed and see forward progress in stars.\nKevin Fischbeck - Bank of America: You don\u2019t mean what we know of already. You don\u2019t mean the '14 data for '15, you mean '15 for '16 to be better than expected?\nStephen Hemsley: Gail, you want to respond to it?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. When the stars were published last year, we had a sense of where our membership was. We have made significant improvements in our group business which will help improve our actual '15 results.\nKevin Fischbeck - Bank of America: Okay. All right. So it's a membership growth within the high star rating plans?\nStephen Hemsley: That\u2019s right.\nKevin Fischbeck - Bank of America: Okay. And then just, so the main question is on the exchanges. You mentioned that your year one was about kind of watching and learning and then year two is more about growth. Can you just give us a sense of some of the things that you have learned? Because you are making a really big move. You are going to do a couple dozen states. You have really moved in. What's given you the comfort and the confidence that this business, since you are still relatively new around the claims development, that it is going to be stable into next year and that this is the year to move in rather than waiting another year to get even more information.\nStephen Hemsley: Well, I will also have the -- so this will be a team response. But, again, this was consistent with how we positioned this right from the beginning that we would observe the first year for the most part and then endeavor to participate. And we will see how we ultimately participate as we go through the balance of this year and get ready for the next year selling season. But the size of the and response of the exchange, we expected growth in it and so forth plays into that thinking and recognition this is going to be an established sector in the healthcare benefits marketplace and that we have to chose to participate at some point of time. It kind of wanted to make sure that we don\u2019t go in too late. So I think, we are thinking this is about the right time.\nGail Boudreaux: This is Gail Boudreaux again. The only thing I would add is, getting back to Steve's comments, we have felt it was a good long-term market. What we have been able to observe and learn over the course of the market as we know the existing pricing, we know the network constructs, we know the consumer behavior on what they picked in these different markets. We have a better understanding of the regulatory structure and the distribution cadence. So from those factors, we are looking at the market as an opportunity. And again more than 75% of that market is going to emerge, we feel that those markets that we are looking at now are much established. So that\u2019s the background around our thinking on exchanges but again we have always thought it was part of our strategy and plan, that this is a good long term market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.\nAndrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley: Moving over to the operating costs, they were actually meaningfully below our expectations and down year-over-year I think once you accounted for the charitable donation despite the pressures from the industry fee. Could you perhaps discuss the level of investments in the quarter and what other savings may have drove down that ratio?\nDave Wichmann: Sure. We are quite pleased, Andy, with the operating cost ratio for the quarter. Obviously it's got a lot of pressure because of the implementation of the insurers fee in the second quarter which of course, it wasn\u2019t in place last year. We are really seeing the advances in our contributions from our PBM business, which is benefitting not only from scale efficiencies but also significant productivity advances, both around just regular process management as well as the implementation of technology. So Dirk and team have done an excellent job there. Otherwise, as we indicated in the investor conference, we were pursuing somewhere around 70 to 80 basis points of annual productivity improvements and we in fact achieved those in this quarter. So really what you are seeing is just raw productivity and scale advantages coming through our businesses as we project it. In terms of investments, I think we outlined those in the script with respect to the types of things that Optum is investing in. It's really investing in growth and I think that growth is really manifesting in terms of its pipeline expansion year-over-year. Kind of very nice job there and as indicated those investments were about $80 million in the quarter. On top of that as you might suspect, there are significant investments going in across the business so to respond to the implementation of the ACA provisions as well as growth -- more broadly -- are preparing for growth more broadly both in the exchange marketplace as well as in Medicaid.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna.\nChristian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna: Just wanted to come back to hepatitis C. Obviously it hasn\u2019t been talked about nearly as much on this call but can you give us a sense for how the expenditures sort of tracked from Q1 to Q2 and sort of the pace of expenditures you are expecting in the back half of the year given the potential for some new drugs coming to the market. Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Dan?\nDaniel Schumacher: Sure. Good morning, Chris. Our Q2 spend for hepatitis C was in line with our revised expectations coming out of the first quarter. We will tell you that in the first quarter, our new patient volume peaked in all of our benefits businesses and I think we have got strong controls over the appropriate use. So as we think about the cost related to hepatitis C and its treatment, we have that accounted for and accommodated within our full year trend outlook as well as in our care ratio guidance.\nChristian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna: Okay. And then if I could, how are discussions going with the state Medicaid partners with regard to the drug. Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Austin?\nAustin Pittman: Sure. This is Austin Pittman. First of all, again, this is the cost of the program we expected to be fully reimbursed. We are very pleased and making strong progress in our discussions with our state partners in securing that reimbursement.\nOperator: Our next question comes from A. J. Rice of UBS.\nA. J. Rice \u2013 UBS: Maybe a two part thing on Optum. First of all, I know you have talked around the investment spending and said it was $80 million in the second quarter but that by the fourth quarter it should have less impact. Is that because that $80 million run rate goes down or is that because of the leverage of spending. And then more broadly, just on OptumRx. You mentioned some positive related to the 2015 selling season. I wondered if you can expand more on, is Optum out there actively pursuing business across the board. Do you have your integrated model fully in place now or you can talk to people about total cost, or is that still something that will come in future selling seasons.\nStephen Hemsley: We will be anxious to answer that question. Larry, you want to take it?\nLarry Renfro: A.J., it's Larry Renfro. I will start with the question on the planned investments and then I start to take up the PBM question in terms of the sales. So when we began the year and had our plan put together, we expected to spend about $200 million in what I will call planned investments for the future. It's a very very similar model to what we have actually done with the PBM and I think you know over the past few years we spent some dollars in order to get the platforms up to speed and we are kind of using that same playbook. So for the year it's $200 million. We have spent year-to-date about $140. So obviously we are overweight in the first half of the year and we will start to see that go down as we head into the fourth quarter. So financial targets and so forth, this is all planned. There is nothing out of the ordinary. So we are online or inline with everything that we are doing. So again, let me say that again, it's $140 million year-to-date that was planned year-to-date out of a total of $200 million. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. So A.J., thanks. A couple of things first. Steve mentioned that we had a nice year in 2014 with respect to our growth. As we look at our pipeline for 2015, our pipeline is up double-digits compared to the same time last year. It's not a ton of business changing hands. If you look at what we have closed this year versus the same time last year, we are certainly ahead. We do feel that our synchronization message is resonating in the market as we go in and we talk to our prospects. It's all about bringing together the medical, the lab, the pharmacy data. Try to optimize outcomes and lower cost. We think we also have a good service offering and I think we do a pretty good job managing specialties. So all of those are contributing to our success.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.\nScott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Just wondering given the broader entry into the public exchanges in 2015, what your strategy is for surmounting the auto enrollment policy that would seem to give an advantage to incumbents? Is it more that you just expect so much more growth in the exchange market that that's not really an issue? And just wondering whether you think that that policy is a bit anti-competitive for new market entrants or that it just benefits the market in terms of reducing likely the overall amount of churn in the market?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure, Jeff?\nJeff Alter: Good morning, Scott, it's Jeff Alter. On the first part, there is going to be, as Gail and Steve mentioned earlier, still a large amount of the population that we expect to be in those exchanges, we will call at the end of the cycle and we expect to take a large part of that new business. But just on the existing population. You know there is a lot of leverage around the subsidy and price changes, so as competitors change prices, it does tend to move the subsidy dollars around pretty strongly. So we believe there will some, there will also be shopping even though people don\u2019t have to shop. I think just the natural consumer play at an exchange is going to cause a shopping experience and we feel we could get some part of that membership shift as it goes along. We are obviously not going to comment on the anti-competitive part of anything.\nScott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank: And just as you see some of the initial rate filings now coming out for the exchanges in the individual market when, how would you say that those are coming out so far relative to your expectations in terms of the competitor filings.\nStephen Hemsley: I think they are within our range of expectations. You are seeing competitors you might have relied a little bit on the three R protection and as that protection goes away, they have to adjust their pricing. And we are seeing that. So nothing that we have seen to date surprises us or changes the approach that we have taken with our own pricing. We are very comfortable with our pricing and just keep in mind that that pricing is driven not only by our forward view of cost but also, as we have mentioned, we have observed the marketplace. In 2014, we are bringing different products to market in some of these exchanges than we would have traditionally brought. Some more HMO. Much tighter alignment with Optum and some of their programs to help us manage the diseases the health of those members and creating a different -- in some cases a different dynamic with the network.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen.\nChristine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company: Could you paint us a picture around Optum360? What kind of investments are you making specifically there this year versus next year? What's the potential? What does this look like a couple of years from now? I am having a hard time visualizing the benefit of the financials and precisely what the model looks like?\nStephen Hemsley: Yes, Larry, you want to start?\nLarry Renfro: Sure. Christine, I am going to hand this off to Bill Miller who is the executive that runs the OptumInsight and where Optum360 sits. And we will not specifically talk about our customers. Maybe I can frame some of the size of our potential accounts and where we are headed and I will let Bill then to talk specifically about Optum360. I think you know that when we set priorities for 2014, we talked about, really one of the priorities going after, and Steve mentioned it earlier, for the larger, deeper relationships and more complex relationships. And last year we aligned with an organization on the west coast to build revenue cycle management and we are starting to build that. So I am going to give you four, four areas that I would say that will kind of depict what we are trying to do and the size of that. Our external backlog right now is up 20% and that\u2019s up to $7.5 billion. Our pipeline is up 122% and continuing to grow. I will say that the government business is in that and if you look to that as a standalone, that's about $1 billion. Probably about $6.6 billion in that total pipeline. If you looked at our top 25 accounts and the revenues that we have had over the past since 2011, our revenues are up 2.5 times. And our accounts that had values of over $100 million are also up 20% year-over-year in the number of accounts that we have. Obviously Optum360, we have a strategy that we are not going to get into detail about because it is an extremely competitive strategy that we are deploying. That's why the amount of investment that we are actually putting in in the first quarter and we will start to see in the fourth quarter, I should say the first half of the year. And we will start to see the benefits of that in the fourth quarter as we talked a few minutes ago with A.J. Also be able to note that we are overweighed in our spend during the first six months of the year. So let me let Bill talk specifically about Optum360 and some of the things going on there.\nBill Miller: Yes, Christine, good question and thank you. So as far as painting that picture, I think the picture is, that\u2019s a very big market, a fragmented market. And we see ourselves I think very well positioned to drive a lot of efficiencies for health systems that are struggling with that fragmentation. We also bring I think a very strong attitude not only from a technology standpoint which we have served the market with for years, but all the services and processes needed to take out cost and operate a revenue cycle with far more efficiency that\u2019s going to be required in an environment where hospitals are continually pressured on their margins. And I think the other thing that we keep top of mind in terms of that vision of the future is we feel uniquely positioned to help drive out the friction between payers and providers, and we also do understand that in the future the role of the consumer and the patient experience associated with their care, their billing is something that\u2019s very critical and I think it's part of the mission of Optum360. And the investments associated with that are, I think being able to strengthen our technology portfolio along with on-boarding our largest clients and as Larry said, these relationships are growing in size and we really like the trajectory and the backlog that we have built and the pipeline growth that we have seen. Particularly over the last, I would say seven, eight months. John, you want...?\nJohn Rex: No, I think -- just to add, Christine, you talked about -- less obviously you talked about the scope of those investments that\u2019s clearly encompassed in the $200 million that Larry has been talking about for full year.\nStephen Hemsley: And a lot of it is basically implementation on a much more comprehensive revenue cycle, population health, analytics paradigm to change the dynamics in large systems.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.\nRalph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse: I want to go back to the MLR point. Can you maybe talk about seasonality in the business, sort of your thoughts there with sort of the continuation of and high penetration of high-deductible plans? Whether there is a potential that that sort of magnifies the cost picture, I guess in the second half of the year. And then along those lines, MLR guidance I guess is still close to that 81% level. You did 82% in the first half. Obviously it implies 80% in the second half. Is that kind of still a fair way to think about it? Thanks.\nDaniel Schumacher: Hi, Ralph. This is Dan Schumacher. On the seasonality related to high deductible, we continue to make inroads in high deductible offerings. I mean it\u2019s an offering within our portfolio. I wouldn\u2019t say that there is any dramatic shift. I think the normal seasonal progression is what you should expect with regard to commercial and how deductibles play out. With regard to the consolidated loss ratio, our full year guidance was 80.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points and we suggest that that could be near the high-end of the range. And I think that\u2019s exactly how you should think about it.\nStephen Hemsley: So no change there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink.\nAna Gupte - Leerink Swann: I wanted to get some color on the [uplift] (ph) for the small group market in 2015. Now that there is proof of concept for public exchanges, might your competitors and you be more incented to price down because you would still make a margin higher than your potentially public exchange start to trip there offerings of benefits to their workers?\nStephen Hemsley: I am not sure that we got clear on the last part of your question. You want to refine that Ana?\nAna Gupte - Leerink Swann: Yes. So I guess what I am trying to understand is, I am hearing generally the buzz is that small group employers are more likely to dump or reduce their offerings for '15. So would that potentially put more pressure on the pricing as well as the size of the market for '15?\nStephen Hemsley: Okay. Jeff?\nJeff Alter: Good morning, Ana. It's Jeff Alter. We continue to believe that the employer dumping will be somewhat moderated, it was moderate this year. We are not sure next year is any year that would be much different than this year as these exchanges establish. And I would say, as you are seeing some of the pricing normalize which might take another year or so for that to happen. Just on the pricing interplay between the two markets. They are different markets and we look at them around the population that we are serving in each one of those. When we think about pricing there is no, right now in our thinking there is an arbitrage between those two marketplaces. They are different. There are different consumers served in those marketplaces. And our pricing for small groups is solely predicated on what we believe that risk looks like, what that membership looks like and then our responses to that risk. And that would be the same for the exchanges as well.\nAna Gupte - Leerink Swann: And does it include your self-insured competition as well. Is that propensity continuing to self-insured? Continuing as there is (indiscernible)?\nStephen Hemsley: Ana, I don\u2019t know what kind of phone you are on but it's not coming through clearly at all. So you want to try that one more time?\nAna Gupte - Leerink Swann: I was just asking if that is also consistent on the self-insured small and mid-market competition. Is there more movement to self-insured that could create pricing pressure again in fully-insured?\nStephen Hemsley: I don\u2019t think any difference in what has been going on steadily for maybe the last decade but, Jeff, Gail, any response?\nGail Boudreaux: This is Gail. No, we haven't seen any acceleration. There is no, as Steve said, a historical trend to self-insured. There was some early discussion around that moving down market but we haven't seen an acceleration in that?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Carroll of Stifel.\nThomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: So question on your Medicaid performance. You are showing very strong results. So I wonder if you could remind us just kind of what you expect into next year. I mean do you expect outsized enrollment growth to continue into 2015 and additionally, where do you expect pretax margins in this business to settle out given a larger population driven by the Affordable Care Act, as well as new groups like dual eligibles?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Austin?\nAustin Pittman: Sure. Thanks for the question. We are excited about the growth as well. It's been an outstanding year as Steve highlighted in his opening comments. We now expect that growth to be over 800,000 on the year. And I will tell you that the thing that is great about it, is if you look at this quarter's growth, the 380,000 that we grew this year, it's really evenly split between expansion populations as well as what I call core growth. So that\u2019s winning procurement, executing those procurements, implementing new programs within states that we are already in that state and have a relationship, and good strong organic growth. I think as far as the prospects for continued growth, we feel very strong about this business. Particularly if you look at the combined strength of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, our ability to really address state partners needs to deliver value in complex population. So I think the outlook is strong.\nThomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: And margins?\nAustin Pittman: As we have talked about before, we expect this business to continue to perform at 3% to 5% range.\nThomas Carroll - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And that the scale will pull you to the stronger side of that?\nAustin Pittman: Absolutely.\nStephen Hemsley: But that\u2019s do different than where he have been for the last couple of years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies.\nDave Windley \u2013 Jefferies: Wanted to get a little more framing around your SG&A expectations as the year progresses. There has been a fair amount of conversation about investments. Your first half is well below, I think your full year guidance. I guess I am trying at, could we expect that the full year will trend towards the lower end of that based on where you are looking so far this year or are there discreet investments that are layering on there in a fairly significant way to drive that up. Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Yes. I guess a couple of things come to mind, is that we are clearly focused on continuing to be focused an efficient in this. And then there is the selling season in the second half of the year, is a big factor. But, Dave?\nDave Wichmann: Yeah, David it's Dave Wichmann again. As Steve outlined, it's both the selling season in the back half of the year which effects Q3. Kind of the preparatory work in advance of OEP and then in the Q4 the actual payment of commissions and otherwise associated with that business. But also the significant work we do to prepare for January 1st and the incremental volumes form growth in our business. So we always see the back half of any given year as having a higher operating cost ratio then the first half of the year. With respect to where we are at on overall guidance, we said it would be 16.7% plus or minus 30. We are still squarely within that range for the full year.\nDave Windley \u2013 Jefferies: Are there, perhaps around exchange, your significant increase in participation in exchange that you anticipate for '15? Is that in line with what you would have anticipated when you gave guidance originally or is there perhaps more investment to prepare for that for 2015?\nStephen Hemsley: David, it's in line with what we had planned all along. So we always anticipated a more modest participation this year and then ramping in the 2015-2016 time period and that\u2019s exactly how this is playing out.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brian Wright of Sterne, Agee.\nBrian Wright - Sterne, Agee: Could you tell us how much of the sequential revenue growth at Optum this quarter was internal versus -- OptumRx was internal versus external?\nStephen Hemsley: I don\u2019t know if we can but obviously just given the size of UnitedHealthcare that it's a meaningful and the in-sourcing. It's a meaningful element there. Dirk, maybe you could comment generally on your balance for the year. I think you may have that available.\nDirk McMahon: Well, I guess what I would say is, we continue to have a pretty good year as we sit and look at it. Some of the efficiencies that Dave pointed out, we will continue to leverage those as well additional purchasing efficiencies that we have specifically in the generic area should continue to make us expand margins a little bit as we proceed through the year.\nBrian Wright - Sterne, Agee: Yes, if I could follow up on EPS progression. Does the commentary about the acceleration in Optum in the fourth quarter and then getting the Medicare Advantage true-ups in second quarter versus third quarter, does that change the back half seasonality versus more recent years like last year?\nStephen Hemsley: No, I think in general the pattern is consistent year to year. So the relative, kind of 40:60 in terms of the first half through the second half and then the fourth quarter should be stronger than the third. So that pattern holds up.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.\nCarl McDonald - Citigroup: Six months ago you talked about growing earnings in 2015 but not at the long-term target rate. The earnings growth you talked about this morning, is that still the right context to think about? And related to that if there's any major shift in the moving pieces that you've highlighted previously in terms of another year of reforming from the patient Medicare rate cuts, that would also be interesting.\nStephen Hemsley: Yes, I am not sure I got the second half of that but, no, we would expect that our targeted growth rate which is kind of 13%-16%, that 15% would be in that zone, just given the continued adjustments. But then moving 16%-17% beyond, we clearly are focused on getting back to that zone and see a path to that. But the timing in terms of stepping through '15-'16, that\u2019s what we are navigating right now.\nCarl McDonald - Citigroup: I'm sorry, the second half of the question was just if there was any change to some of the bigger moving pieces you talked about previously for 2015 in terms of Medicare rate cuts as well as another year of reform implementation being the biggest headwinds to getting to that long-term growth rate?\nStephen Hemsley: Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say there are new headwinds, which is a very positive thing to be. And I actually think that we are making real progress on the -- I think this quarter's performance and kind of our outlook. We are making steady progress on the challenges that are in the marketplace for us and everyone else. So I don\u2019t think there are any dynamic elements of that. If I go back to the things that I have parsed through in thinking about that, I would say the Medicaid performance and growth is a nice upside. I think our positioning on Medicare, I see us having made a nice adjustment here and are focused on making sure that we are attuned to kind of the next era of Medicare Advantage and Medicare product progression. We see a nice potential in terms of the international market place and good work that has been done in Amil. We are going to keep a positive posture towards the exchange market place and see that in the kind of same margin range as our, let's say our Medicaid business, at a 3% to 5% range. When you look at Optum and its potential and the opportunity for the collaborative care, local care delivery businesses, the potential of the major relationships. Kind of anchoring relationships for OptumInsight and 360 and the ability to kind of diversify and take a new, maybe broader more progressive approach on the PBM. That really does start to tie in medical costs, diagnostic testing and specialty pharma and so forth. I think that to provides a lot of potential to work with, kind of against the challenges that the ACA set in front of all of us and that we are working through right now. So that what gives us a view that we have a lot of work to do but there is lot to work with.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nStephen Hemsley: So with that we appreciate very much your attention today at UnitedHealth Group. Optum, and UnitedHealthcare delivered, I think a very solid second quarter. Growing both revenues and earnings per share. We remain focused on consistent, fundamental execution, innovation, service. We believe we are positively positioned for the full year and a strong close in '14 as well as continuing growth in '15 and beyond. So thank you and we will see you next quarter?\nOperator: This does conclude today's UnitedHealth Group's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

I'll be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here's some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual result to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 17, 2014, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we will review the first quarter results in the context of our full year objectives for 2014. Objectives that include continuing to diversify our services and product offering, continuing to develop and expand our capabilities and relationships and further strengthened and consistent fundamental execution and services to customers and consumers. And we are working towards all these while new national healthcare policies begin to come into the place and new baselines for market behaviors and new market dynamics become realities. We plan to deliver revenues in a range of $128 billion to $129 billion for the year produce earnings in the range $5.40 to $5.60 per share and generate cash flows from operations between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion. UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare and Optum performed largely as we expected in the first quarter. We remained in our plans for 2014 and as usual continue to work through more challenges and benefits for the moment. Longer term, we continue to more clearly see evidence for the growth opportunities for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum as we knew beyond the more negative immediate term impacts of the ACA and its implementation. This is was really the first quarter a full scale operation under the ACA. Everything else in the past three years has been more of a preamble. The ACA's impacts on 2014 had been immediate and significant as we described at our Investor's conference. Nondeductible insurance taxes, ACA prescribed Medicare Advantage funding pull backs, commercial underwriting changes and various other provisions cumulatively reduced our per share, net earnings by nearly $0.30 for this quarter and sequestration cut an additional $0.05 in this quarter. On a full year basis 2014 Medicare funding actions will cut roughly $0.45 per share beyond that. This makes a grand total of about $1.50 per share and externally driven year-over-year pressure fully consistent with our view at our Investors conference in December. The ACA impacts every major line item of our consolidated results and distorts comparisons virtually all performance ratio. This will continue as the year's progresses, a new regulatory and tax baselines are established and settled in, but we think some very important early observations can be made about the ACA's first quarter introduction. First consumers and benefits sponsors are showing by their actions the clear value they see in private sector, managed care products and services. The capabilities of the private sector healthcare community are significant and have proven to be highly adaptable to serving the needs and demands of consumers in all stages and situations of life as well as government and private benefit sponsors and the broader health system. And ultimately there should be advances access to care and the healthcare system as a whole will become more effective and efficient and consistent overtime. Early evidence of these is visible and will produce long-term growth opportunities for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Let's review, how this played out in the first quarter for UnitedHealth Group starting with UnitedHealthcare, whose revenues grew $1 billion or 3.6% year-over-year to $29.3 billion led by membership growth in Medicaid. Over the past 12 months alone, UnitedHealthcare has implemented six new or renewed Medicaid contracts and grown to serve 395,000 new members. In this past quarter, we grew by 255,000 people driven by the expanded eligibility offered in and about half the States, where we serve Medicaid beneficiaries as well as new membership in traditional categories. We expect growth throughout the year and could well exceed the upper end of our outlook of $350,000 to $450,000 additional people served this year. The Congressional Budget Office forecasted 12 million people will obtain coverage through Medicaid by the end of 2016 and we will endeavor to gain market share serving the needs of these beneficiaries and their State's sponsors. Nationally managed Medicaid, is also broadening to serve new patients with greater clinical needs like dual eligible. We believe our integrated and in the market clinical model gives us distinct advantages in serving these higher growth; more complex areas. Our model integrates behavioral, pharmaceutical, medical and social services with the focus on the 5% of the population that drives well over 50% of the total medical cost in the typical Medicaid program. In Medicare, we began the year with growth of 360,000 across all Medicare product categories. As Part D sales were strong and Medicare Supplement also grew nicely. Participation in our Medicare Advantage program was essentially flat down 5,000 people sequentially and well within the range we expected, despite significant market exists and products network adjustments made in response to the 2014 Medicare Advantage rate cuts of more than 6%. We continue to manage our Medicare Advantage products and cost structure with the local market level and we will stay focused on that task all this year and next; given the continued adverse funding climate for Medicare Advantage. Commercial membership also began the year generally in line with our expectation with a sharp decrease in people served through fee-based relationship as well as some expected declined in risk-based business. As expect our individual policy business declined this quarter as we decrease by 90,000 with the advent of the ACA. In the commercial market, we experienced a strong competitive period over early renewals for Legacy benefits, where many small group customers renewed early to avoid community rating and ACA price increases. These decisions were rational, driving healthier groups to renew early. While other groups took advantage of the community rating or that was the best course of action. Over the last quarter, we have seen intensified pricing in several markets including small group in New York, a large market for us. We believe several carriers there including new entrants our pricing well below cost and what we would view as unsustainable pricing levels. If this climate continues, we could see some further pressure on risk based membership beyond the ranges, we anticipated this year. And at Amil, we are beginning to see clear signs of response and recovery from surgeon utilization caused by aggressive access standards imposed nationally by the Regulatory Authorities in mid-2013. We continued to project a 6% commercial medical cost trend plus or minus 50 basis points for 2014. First quarter usage benefited slightly from intense winter conditions across the mid-western and northeastern areas of the country. Offsetting this item was the rapid launch of an effective and very expensive new hepatitis C therapy. The aggressive US pricing practices on this has been well publicized and continues to be quite controversial. We are working diligently to ensure this medication is applied under clinically appropriate standards. Patients were treated across the Medicaid commercial and Medicare Part D categories that cost to more than $100 million to us in the quarter. The Federal Government will bear significant expense in the Part D program because the high cost of this treatment causes the patient to quickly move through the donut hole into the 80% CMS reinsurance quarter. Meanwhile, State Medicaid Directors are at varying stages of concluding whether to include the medication on their approved state pharmacy list and if so, how to pay for it. Stepping back from these first quarter trends are full year commercial care ratio will see pressure caused by a combination of the revenue impact from stronger than expected early renewal activity in December at pre-ACA rates. The under pricing dynamic in New York at higher than expected utilization and cost related hepatitis. The size and diversity and United Health Group tends to mute the effect of the commercial variance on the consolidated care ratio, but we expect this ratio could lean toward the higher end of the 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range, we provided last December. Before I turn to Optum, I want to recognize some of our colleagues with us today who have taken on new roles at UnitedHealth Group. All in keeping with our long standing philosophy of moving talented executives across the enterprise to broaden their experience and management depth. Jack Larsen has moved from the Medicare business to head up our rapidly growing Optum Collaborative Care, which includes our Care Delivery businesses, a perfect transition given his background in Medicare and extensive M&A background. Steve Nelson has shifted from his role leading our local market oriented Medicaid business to heading our Medicare and Retirement operation, where we are putting intense focus on market-by-market strategies around clinical care, network alignment and quality [stars]. And Austin Pittman takes over at our Community & State Medicaid business coming from his most recent assignment leading our overall UnitedHealthcare network and local commercial market leadership before that. Turning now to Optum, it is becoming more evident the capabilities we have collectively built in our services, platform are increasingly recognized in the marketplace. Optum continues to grow and mature quarter-by-quarter. We continue to evolve to meet the needs of the market further integrate offerings, strengthen and grow relationships and align our efforts to the most valuable and sustainable opportunities to make the healthcare system perform better. More participants recognized Optum is in position to help customers engage their toughest healthcare challenges. Our work assisting the healthcare.gov website in the last quarter of 2013 has led to new relationships, new pipelines of potential work and new contracts with the spectrum of customers for 2014. We expect further growth in government services this year continuing this first quarter's trend. Our efforts to help our customers improve their end-to-end performance and their structural cost to move ahead with the launch of our Optum360 revenue management business with Dignity Health. We are developing a pipeline of additional health systems and expect to add business to Optum360 as the year progresses. Optum is seeing positive market response to its broad business process outsourcing capabilities as well. Optum Health is aligned around five key growth areas; prevention, intervention, financial services, distribution and care delivery. Broad capabilities meeting market needs, matched with an efficient, agile, customer focused organizational structure. The relationships we are building, leveraging these critical capabilities and they will be instrumental in Optum's future revenue and earnings growth as the consumer becomes a more significant buyer and decision-maker in healthcare. OptumRx is working a strong prospect pipeline in pharmacy services. Our distinctive focus on managing total cost by synchronizing information and care process across the medical, lab and pharmaceutical continuum is driving significant interest. We are only able to generate this interest as a result of the meaningful investments; we have made in OptumRx over the past couple of years. And similarly, we are making targeted investments in OptumHealth and OptumInsight to seek opportunities in areas such as consumer engagement, consumer distribution services, next generation analytics that combine administrative and clinical data at the scale 60 million people or more and next generation medical care review and compliance analytics. We will also invest startup cost in the assimilation of each new Optum360 relationship. This quarter earnings bear $60 million of these investments, which will continue over the course of the year, but somewhat more waited in the first half. All of these resonate with one theme; new and sustained areas for growth by helping the system to perform better for everyone. Turning to Optum performance for the quarter revenues grew 29% to $11.2 billion and earnings from operations grew 20% year-over-year to $650 million. Operating margins decline slightly due to the exceptional growth of the lower margin OptumRx business as well as the planned investment we just discussed. OptumRx led this quarters reported results with revenues up 43.5%. Earnings from operations up 114.2% and operating margins expanding a full percentage point to 3.2%. We filled 140 million adjusted scripts this quarter up 38% year-over-year. OptumInsight had strong growth in government and sponsored services in the quarter. At the same time, they slowdown and hospital clinical compliance services pressured revenues and operating earnings year-over-year and sequentially. As the Federal Government deliberated over medical necessity processes for Medicare, it's so called Two-Midnight Rule. At the same time, our newly introduced compliance offering serving hospitals needs for clean medical necessity documentation for privately insured patients have seen accelerated growth in sales in and pipeline. We expect OptumHealth and OptumInsight to increase in profitability as the year progresses accelerating into the second half. All in Optum delivered a strong first quarter with improved earnings and capital returns as compared to last year and remains on pace to produce $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion in operating earnings this year. As well as roughly one-third of UnitedHealth Group's cash flow from operations. All, while investing in the future growth in its business. As a whole, we have a solid start to the year, against the increasing headwinds, we described at our investors conference. UnitedHealth Group's first quarter revenues grew nearly $1.4 billion or 4.5% to $31.7 billion and net earnings were at $1.10 per share fully in line with our expectation. Cash flows from operations were strong at $1.4 billion up 34% year-over-year and a good start toward our full-year projection. The biggest challenges in 2014 are the combination of nondeductible healthcare taxes and ACA mandated Medicare rate cuts. On top of sequestration and the government's continued systematic under funding of Medicare Advantage. Including the 2014 Medicare funding issue and other ACA provisions, these impacted our first quarter results by well more than $0.35 per share and will pressure our full year net earnings by about $1.50 per share. We expect second quarter earnings per share will growth this past quarter's results, but as planned will come in below last year's reported second quarter, which benefited from strong reserve development. It did not bear some of the competitive commercial market pressures, UnitedHealthcare faces today and like this quarter, we will have substantial ACA effects. Items we are watching including hepatitis C treatment cost, the full recovery State Medicaid fees, commercial risk-based membership, New York and the overall performance of our Medicare business. And we are always respectful of medical cost trend even though they are basically inline in the quarter. As always, we will strive to deliver the best possible result in both the short and longer term. We expect our 2014 net earnings to land in the existing range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share and we mean that as a range. The items we discussed this morning, might serve temper ones thinking within that range. Standing back from the number, UnitedHealth Group faces an expansive long-term growth opportunity. In the US alone, there is the opportunity to approach and serve the more than 700, the Fortune 1,000 companies not yet our customers. Today we serve, more than 85 million people leaving more than 230 million Americans, we do not touch. There is a growing number of people in government sponsored programs, who are yet to benefit from Managed Care. There is significant upside potential in our PBM market share and there are multibillion dollar, multi-year opportunities that links services, technology and insight to fundamentally health-to-health system perform better for everyone. Beyond the US, we see the same growing opportunities. As the challenges other national health system space around access, control, affordability and affected decision making are in fact the same ones, we have here in the US even as these systems differ. The level of a longer term success, we achieve will depend on two things. First an adaptive and innovative approach to applying our three long standing core competencies of clinical care, organization and delivery. Health information analysis insight and advanced enabling technology. And second the effectiveness of our leaders in our organizational culture. We serve in the sensitive social services arena in the early stage of important market changes and we believe success will come to those, who can build trust, serve with compassion and control costs; while driving higher quality outcomes. We thank you for your time, this morning and look forward to your questions. So we will give you a second to get organized and we will pick up your question. Thank you.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions at this time. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc: Yes, hi good morning. Could you talk about the outlook for Medicare Advantage for 2015? I realized we have to get through this year firs but, in light of the various changes that were made in finalization of the rate. I know one of your competitors has put out a point estimate for the all in rate impact and was wondering, if there was a range that you could offer on a similar basis?\nSteve Hemsley: Yes, sure I think in terms of a range. First of all, we would comment that the final rate notice did mitigate some of the originally proposed cuts for 2015, but in fact when that results is that rates were once again taken down somewhere in the order of maybe slightly over 3% and that really comes on the heels of overall funding decline of over 6% in the prior year and that's against arising overall medical cost trend. So we would bracket that around, let's say the 3.5% kind of range and honestly, if that is somewhat disappointing, we were hoping for and we are positive all in response and so we will be focused on working through and trying to mitigate that as we approach 2015, but I would bracket it in let's say 3% to 3.5% range.\nMatthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc: If I could just ask for one clarification on that? Is that inclusive of the because it's not a rate factor the impact of the increase in the industry fee, at least under the ACA provisions to-date?\nSteve Hemsley: Yes, that is an all in kind of what we see funding deficiency to Medicare for 2015.\nMatthew Borsch \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Lake from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co: Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow-up on the comments around 14 commercial MLR specifically, if those coming toward the higher-end of the range? Can you tell us whether, you think that would likely drive ETF to the lower end of what, being your full year guidance or if you think there are other businesses that could were to offset that and what they might and then just quickly on the MLR side. You mentioned the $100 million of hep C cost in the quarter. Can you tell us what your original expectations were for hep C in Q1 and how you're currently expecting this cost to trend for the rest of the year, thanks?\nSteve Hemsley: It was a little gobbled on that second one. Your second question is a $100 million related to what?\nJustin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co: I'm sorry, $100 million of hep C cost, I think you mentioned up on them.\nSteve Hemsley: I got it, okay.\nJustin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co: For the quarter, how your expectations were for the end of the year for that versus $100 million and how you expect the trend for the rest of the year?\nSteve Hemsley: I got it. Well, maybe the way to frame the care ratio and I will let Gail to drill and Dan Schumacher address this in more specifics but, we saw pressure in the first quarter. It is the first quarter those pressures are coming from a variety of sources. We will endeavor and try to mitigate against that over the course of the year, but we think it's appropriate to alert you to the fact that care ratio will feel pressure because of these factors. And as you point out, we have a very diverse business not only within the UnitedHealthcare platform but in the Optum platform and we have a number of ways to fight back against those pressures and we are endeavoring to do that is early in the year and so we are staying largely within the ranges and kind of giving you a color around, where we see the pressure points. And then in terms of hepatitis C, Gail, Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Sure, good morning. Justin. On hepatitis C as Steve mentioned. We saw $100 million of cost in the first quarter little more than that and that was across all of our benefits business. So Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial and I think what we are seeing in not in consistent with what folks are seeing across the industry, which is higher pent up demand, as there was more patients that were warehoused leading up to the launch hepatitis C vaccines. And so we would expect that there would be some moderation and new patient volume as that initial pent up demand starts to wear off, but I would tell you that obviously these are 12 week and 24 week treatment regimen. So those folks that were introduced in the first quarter, will carry forward into the second. In terms of its relation to our expectation. I won't say that's specifically other than to say that it's a multiple of what we had expected.\nJustin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co: Thanks for the color.\nSteve Hemsley: Next question, please?\nOperator:  Our next question is from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nPeter Heinz Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Yes, I would like to understand a little bit more about what you expect to do about the rising cost of hep C going forward, as you mentioned moderating but you know when it becomes perhaps all [oral] towards to the end of the year. You would to expect to reaccelerate again and in particular for next year. So how you're going to price that into your businesses for next year, do you expect States to reimburse this year or carve it out? So can you build on that a little bit and the other cost item, that you talked about was in New York, can you tell us? How you're going to respond in New York to the pricing pressure there?\nSteve Hemsley: Sure, as you point out. How hep C is addressed really does vary across the businesses based upon the segment of business that we are in, so we will try to respond to several of those and maybe we will start out with Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure, good morning. Let me first address the hep C, then we will talk about the issue in New York. I think as you mentioned first the hep C therapies as you know are very effective and one of the things that we are doing is working to ensure that appropriate clinical protocols and standards are in place, but as noted the price is exceptionally high and as Steve said in his opening comments that controversial and it's putting a lot of pressure on States, CMS and in terms of our day as well as our employer sponsor, so the cost has to be addressed. As we think about actions. In the Medicaid space particularly. First and foremost, we are working with each of our states to ensure that we are aligned with their expectations on their PDL and how they want to handle that and also giving them ideas on risk mitigation from a cost perspective, what we are paying for the Medicaid it is the cost to the program that wasn't priced in. So we are working with our States to figure out that funding gap. We do expect it as a cost of delivering service in that space and would expect that will be reimbursed but the timing is what is uncertain now because accelerated very quickly and as Dan said, in his opening remarks about this because warehousing and the rapid launch, this is something everyone's dealing with across the States right now. In terms of the issue on New York. Let me open up a few comments, I'll just Jeff Alter, our CEO of our Commercial Business to comment. I think Steve highlighted in New York, we have a somewhat I think unique situation in the small group market in particular, where there are new entrants as well as existing competitors pricing below what we believe is the sustainable cost structure and pricing below, what we believe our cost. We've always maintained pricing discipline. We're a market share leader in New York, we've had a long history of several decades of consistent performance in that market, but we do think that there is a market correction needed. We are going to stay very disciplined in our pricing but again because of the dynamic that's going on there. It's something that, Steve and we highlighted in our opening comments.\nJeff Alter: Hi, Peter. Good morning, it's Jeff Alter. Just add a little color to that. As most people are probably aware, we've served that market place successfully for couple of decades. We know that marketplace really well. We've got leading economics, we understand the pricing and we really believe at this point that market has got to come back to a more sustainable level. We are comfortable with our pricing in that marketplace. It's just that others, I'm chosen to well below our pricing and that's going to create an issue in that market place. We will talk to the regulator about it. But in the short run, we are going to maintain our disciple like we have on that discipline that serve just well on that market place, but it will put pressure as we think about '14 as we pace into the other quarters in '14. It will put some pressure on risk-based, our membership.\nSteve Hemsley: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDave Windley \u2013 Jefferies LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to shift over to Optum. Curious how you see, your margins progressing in Optum through the year. You mentioned ramping Optum360 making investments there. I know, you clearly need to see a pretty substantial ramp up over the course of the year to get to that margin guidance range. So interested in progression there please.\nSteve Hemsley: We do expect that, Optum is performing exceptionally well and doing it while balancing investments and the assimilation of new business. So it's impressive performance John, Larry?\nLarry Renfro: John, can start and then I'll [indiscernible].\nJohn Rex: Yes, so just Dave to lead off, I'd say both overall Optum in the individual segment results were in line with the expectations. I think kind of part of what you're alluding to that Dave, is within OptumHealth and OptumInsight earnings were down year-over-year about 4%, 5% respectively here. And what we are doing here is really investing for the future. I would say it's centerpiece of one Optum chapter two. It's all about investing for our future growth. Well I can, draw the parallels to OptumRx and what we did there over couple last few years investing several hundred million dollars into that business and you can now see the results as we are kicking off into 2014. As we look at '14 for ourselves here in OptumInsight and OptumHealth. We'd be looking to invest over $200 million in those businesses this year. All about next generation clinical, administrative, data analytics, collaborative care. Our Optum360 business. We are consistent with kind of look we provided at Investor Day and back to your direct question on progression looking for 40-60 split in terms of earnings progression first half, second half. So get direct to that.\nLarry Renfro: So Dave, it's Larry Renfro but let me make a couple of comments. As John said, Steve said we are investing obviously in future growth. This is all part of the one Optum plan that we put in place three years ago. Where we are continuing to balance growth, investments and cost management. I won't go back over what John was talking about in terms of the some of the examples, but I will mention the PBM because that is the perfect example of something we invested in for a couple of years and we are now starting to see the pay off of that. I'd also tell you, that you could refer to healthcare.gov and the way that we've been working the Federal Government as well as the State as we are starting to partner that's part of one of our disciplines of larger and deeper relationship and we believe that's going to pan out, but the most important thing probably is that $60 million of expense in the first quarter was a planned expense. We haven't [DDA] from our plan and we will reset at this point in time. I think you can look at both business segments and see that the revenues are up. I would tell you that OI or the OptumInsight backlog is up 18% to $7.2 billion and I can also tell you that OptumHealth and OptumInsight's pipeline is 58%. So all this is planned, we are pretty comfortable where we are set with a solid start to the year and believe that will be strong for the rest of the year.\nDave Windley \u2013 Jefferies LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Sarah James from Wedbush. Your line is open.\nSarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up here on [ZUBSOLV]. First if you could kind of frame it, so the $100 million is about 1,200 cases. Could you split that between the three segments then to follow-up on pricing? Is it currently priced into your commercial product for this year? How does factoring it into Part D work and then Gail said that, she expected [ZUBSOLV] to be reimbursed for Medicaid does that retracted to the drug launch or more going forward?\nSteve Hemsley: I think we will respond kind of in more general terms. We are certainly not going to get into case specific across segments. So absent that, I think we can give you a response.\nDan Schumacher: Good morning, Sarah. Dan Schumacher again, with respect to the new patient volume that we're seeing. We are seeing the highest volume on a percentage basis in Medicaid lock as you would expect as well as in Medicare and then follow-up by commercial, but when you translate that through to the impact obviously Medicare is lower because of the reinsurance aspects of Part D. So that gives you a sense of where the volume is coming from, with regard to the reimbursement. I'd ask Austin Pittman to provide some perspective.\nAustin Pittman: Sure. Thanks Dan. So again as Gail mentioned, we are working diligently with all of our States first to get in alignment with their coverage decisions. Second on risk mitigations strategies, where we are covering again. We do expect it to that is a funding gap that will be solved certain issue of timing and we would expect that to be solved for the contract period.\nSarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc: Does that mean retroactive?\nAustin Pittman: Yes.\nSarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc: Yes, okay. Thank you.\nJohn Penshorn: Sarah, it's John Penshorn. Just I ought for caution on estimating number of people because as Steve mentioned the Federal Government is also covering some of this cost through their funding for the Part D program catastrophic coverage.\nSarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc: Got it. Thank you.\nSteve Hemsley: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Your line is open.\nChristine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi, there. At your Investor Day you mentioned that you were targeting 10 or more really large customer relationships by 2016 within Optum and I hear you about the backlog and the pipeline. Could you talk about, where you see those large relationships progressing in and when we might see some of those?\nSteve Hemsley: Sure. We will respond in general terms obviously it's sensitive in terms of these things are active in the market today. So we don't comment ever on specific clients or opportunities but in broader terms. Larry, do you want to?\nLarry Renfro: Sure, I will start and I might ask Dirk and I might ask Andy and [Bill Miller] all three to comment on this. We obviously are talking a lot about what we are doing with Optum360 and that marketplace that is a growth market place for us. The pipeline as Steve said, we from competitive standpoint would not really want to talk about right now. Especially what we are doing on the revenue cycle management side. So I will ask Bill in a second to talk about that. I would tell you on the PBM side. We continue to grow, we continue to see a large number of our RSP's that we are participating in and I ask Dirk to speak to that and on the government side. Obviously what we were doing with the States, what we were doing with the Federal Government and some of the programs that we are involved in, our deals. But also, we are concentrating in the, what I call our collaborative care area that's our care delivery organization. We are going to beat that up bit, so I might ask Jack Larsen to start with that and just give a little feel for what we are doing there.\nJack Larsen: Thanks, Larry. Good morning, Christine. Jack Larsen. We would view the opportunity to investing our line with some of the better performing primary care physician oriented physician groups and other specialty groups around the country as really central to Optum taking on the mission of some of the toughest challenges of the healthcare system. For example today, in our local care delivery organization. We shouldn't think about as our broadly speaking our physician groups. We serve in 19 markets today and we serve just a little over 1 million people as patients. I would expect this to continue to grow, through some of those larger more comprehensive relationships that your questions sort of pointing at as well as grow it organically and at the continued use of M&A which I think, we're pretty good at there.\nSteve Hemsley: Well, maybe Andy you could talk about the government.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure, hi Christine. Very quickly, we've been pleased to have the opportunity to serve both Federal and State Government. I think what they've seen is something that's [indiscernible] of the answer to your question is, they've hopefully seen the technology the general healthcare and the execution capability that an organization like Optum can provide. I think that, we will build relationships both at the State level as well as take our technology out commercially in a bigger and bigger way really substantial relationship where we become a more embedded part of our clients.\nSteve Hemsley: So maybe Dirk on the PBM?\nDirk McMahon: Yes on the PBM, hi Christine. Our pipeline's up a big year-over-year and this really on top of a nice strong sales showing last year. If you look at final [spinings], we've attended. We are certainly getting our ad backs with a big customers. For example this year, I've already attended two final [spinings] where opportunities where in the 0.5 million member range. We are certainly getting our opportunities. We are excited about our pipeline, although I will tell you we are really still early in the season at lot [TBD].\nLarry Renfro: Two more areas, I'll ask Mike [indiscernible] and this goes back to Steven's comment in his opening remark about the 700 organizations that we do not do business with today. Obviously on our consumer solution side, we are starting to really target. So Mike, maybe you might want to comment on those?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure, this is Mike [indiscernible]. So from a employer perspective there's 700 of the Fortune 1,000 that Optum doesn't serve in any way today. We think there is a large opportunity out there for us to take a lot of our consumer solutions directly to those and wrap those services around them. So we are in ramping up the sales force. We are in conversations, starting those conversations with the number of these large employers. We are also starting conversations with a number of associations and other places to try to get to consumers with product and services that we think will really empower them to take ownership at their healthcare in new ways.\nLarry Renfro: So I'll end with [Bill Miller]. Bill, could you talk a little bit about our hospital market.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes, so Christine. Thanks a lot. There's three things that I'll touch on and where these big relationships will continue to grow and foster and our three basic areas as we mentioned. Optum360 and we are in several negotiations with the next phase of clients, we obviously aren't going to expose those right now, but I'd also remind you that business platform is adding clients every day. They may not be the big large multi-year arrangements and many of their if you look at our backlog going 18% to $7.2 billion that's a function of those tools that we have out in the marketplace of subsets of a full blown and the [NDL] being absorbed by many, many clients on a quarterly basis. And those set the stage for large arrangements down the line and some of those are measured in the $10 million to $15 million arrangements over the course of three years to five years, but we will see other very large ones added over the year and then I think we are doing far more work on the ACO side helping hospitals, reengineer themselves to become ready for fee-for-value. So we've had several large transactions in that space and we will continue to see those through the year and then finally, the other area emphasis for us both in our payer, provider. Andy touched on it in the government market is our continue ability to impact the market place from a BPO standpoint. With our technology scale, with our state-of-the-art technology and ready to go technology along with our consulting services. We are finding acceptance in the marketplace whether it be amongst payers or providers to slide in the positions, where we are really managing large chunks of there, if you will core business so that they can focus on taking care of their members. And with our backgrounds both on the payer and provider side. We end up being a pretty suitable partner in those really game changing decisions that governments, payers and providers are making and more consistent basis as margin pressures and talent pressures continue to mount the market place.\nChristine Arnold \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Thank you.\nSteve Hemsley: So I might complete that very comprehensive response, by saying if you listen Optum's challenges are out more around abundance. There are significant opportunities getting those relationships started right, recognizing. They're going to be substantially larger than the relationships we've had in the past that they're going to engage a broader spectrum of services and that they're much longer term. We are trying to be thoughtful about these approaches in each of our businesses there as well as continuing to make sure that we are investing. So that we are delivering ever better value. So they're navigating in that those kind of waters right now which are really great waters to be in at the moment. So next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.\nA. J. Rice \u2013 UBS Investment Bank: Thanks a lot everybody. I guess I was thinking, you hadn't really said much about your views about, with how the whole public exchange for share process played out and now that. We are done with the open enrollment. You got to think fairly quickly about what you're going to do with respect to 2015, give us any updated thoughts and assessments of how it played out and what your posture will be for next year?\nSteve Hemsley: Sure. I'll have Gail and others to respond principally to that. We were involved from the Optum side, so we do have some perspectives from that. it is still very, very early in the life of the exchanges and second year in terms of how they will evolve, will be effectively somewhat by what I call, a lot of spontaneous change over the course of the first year implementation, which we understand that does require some consideration and calibration as we go, but Gail do you want to start?\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Good morning. As you know, we had a very modest footprint in 2014 and as we've said and still believe, we do have buyers to increase that participation in 2015. There's a lot happening in that, we are in the process of doing our evaluation. Obviously, we are looking at how the markets and products are regulated. The networks that we would put in place, but there are some things that we did learn in the first part of the market for us that the size of the overall market is positive and that the configuration of products around sober, is also positive for the market and that there is now some experience and a desire to be, to keep the exchanges stable. So we don't know much about second year pricing. We do enough first year pricing still again, at this stage just reiterate that our [bias] is to increase our participation to '15 and we will share more with you as those decisions are made over the coming months.\nA. J. Rice \u2013 UBS Investment Bank: Okay and great thanks.\nSteve Hemsley: You know, I'd also observe that while we will, if we engaged in readiness. You really don't have to commit until September I think. So we have time to see how this plays out a bit.\nA. J. Rice \u2013 UBS Investment Bank: Okay.\nSteve Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to go back to the comments on intensified pricing. I guess ones, where I make sure is it just in New York or you're seeing it. Your startup in other markets and then second did you say that, in New York it was coming from new entrants and existing competitors and then just the last piece. You're just trying to sort of tying in on how related it is to, the public exchanges plans, maybe pricing that would encourage dumping or is it or are you saying it's just sort of head-to-head off exchange sort of land grab. Thanks.\nSteve Hemsley: I think that Gail and Jeff are perfectly prepared for this.\nGail Boudreaux: Good morning, Ralph. A couple of things because there is number of questions embedded in there. Let me start first with your questions around exchanges in early renewals. One of the first things, is that we've had a very successful early renewals of our small group customers in the fourth quarter that clearly is a big positive for us going forward. In terms of the New York issue, I'm going to let Jeff specifically address it. We talked about it, but it is a unique to New York issue and yes it is both existing competitors well as new entrants, but there is some unique dynamics in that market. You brought a question around what's happening in the competitiveness of the overall market. As Steve said in his opening comments, we have seen in the first quarter again after very successful early renewals of small groups and intensified pricing in some slack markets that is having an impact on our fully insured risk because we have stayed very disciplined in our pricing. So that's really the dynamic that's going on it is select market. And there is dynamic of the early renewal that occurred that having impact on that. New York has some unique characteristics and we wanted to point that up because of those in your characteristics and I'll ask Jeff again to comment on that.\nJeff Alter: Good morning, Ralph. Yes actually, when you think of that New York market place it was probably one of the least affected by the ACA as it is been community rated. Some fairly stable from '13 going into '14 but there were some new entrants into that market place that in our opinion clearly are underpriced what the cost structure is in New York, not only our cost structure but certainly their cost structure. And then over the last few years, we've had competitors that have left the New York market place that chose to reenter the market place in January '14 and we see those competitors also under priced for what the economics would call for it.\nSteve Hemsley: So next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Thanks, I know it's clearly very early here but just wanted to get your thoughts on expectations for the 2016 MA rates, just sort of thinking about some of the factors that benefited the 2015 rates at CMS, said that they may revisit for example freezing the move to the risk adjustment model, then also delaying their proposal one on the HRA proposals. You know I there was hope and expectations at the 2016 MA rates, we can see the sky sort of clear there, but given some of those factors that I mentioned, just interested in your thoughts here on, 2016 MA rates?\nSteve Hemsley: You know, I'm not sure that we offer kind of public perspective on future rate settings that we don't really have any control over. We are aware of the factors and many others that go into thinking in terms of rate setting. We are still digesting 2015 and I really am not going to comment about that rate setting process. If you look back, our [batting] average on that would be pretty poor. So I don't think we are going to set into that, I would just speculate that there is been pretty steady funding pressure in terms of the Medicare Advantage program that it is been hit severely by the insurance taxes. It's been effected by the funding posture in various ways that CMS develops the rates each year and this is now been several years against a moderate but still rising overall cost trend. So we will be very watchful and careful with respect to continuing to advocate for fair funding to the Medicare Advantage segment. It's a segment that serves 15 million seniors, it continues to grow. It continues to perform exceptionally well particularly in comparison to the fee-for-service program. So we would be advocates of thinking that programs really should be more the future of Medicare and funded appropriately for that purpose and that it affects seniors. Our posture there hasn't really changed and it won't change in '16 and we will be hopeful that, to you know the funding perspectives take that into consideration going forward. Beyond that, I really can't really respond to your question.\nScott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Christian Rigg from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChristian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just want to make sure, I understand the messaging on the Hep C sorry to come back to that, but you know Dan I know you said percentage wise you're seeing the most volume in the government segments. But in the press release, the only area where you're specifically highlighted is in the commercial side. So is it fair to assume that, sort of the greatest area of surprise has occurred in commercial or there is been across the board. Thanks.\nDan Schumacher: Good morning, Chris. It's Dan. We've been surprised on the volume, the pent up demand across all three businesses and maybe I'll step through the Commercial Care ratio and how that goes into the consolidated and how you think about Medicare and Medicaid to put it into context around the pieces. So from, as you look at the Commercial Care ratio it was higher this quarter than we had expected and there's really two pieces two it. One obviously Hep C and the other element is the early renewals. So we saw greater volume of early renewals and so customers choosing to stay with their existing plan typically healthier and younger and that led to less premium. So those are two factors that were really influencing the commercial outcome and then when you blend that together with Medicare and Medicaid which had pressure from Hep C but overall are performing well in line with our expectations that meets the impact at a consolidated level. So hopefully that provides greater color on the implications inside each for the businesses.\nChristian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Understood. Thanks.\nSteve Hemsley: And I wouldn't take any undue significance to the order. We just merely talked about commercial first and got it in there first, there was no intent there. Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Sheryl Skolnick from CRT Capital Group. Your line is open.\nSheryl Skolnick \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC: Good morning. I have to say to put this in context $0.35 worth of earnings pressure to come up with this decent quarter with hard work on a big organization and it's appreciated and I respect it very much. The question I have to get away from the important detail of Hep C and some of the other items is, to step back and perhaps take a look at the bigger picture of the company for a second. I noticed that for example you spent $345 million, if my numbers are correct this quarter on acquisition. You're spending another $200 million on investments in the two Optum businesses Health and Insight in order to create platforms in structure and opportunity for further growth, but what I'm really I'm trying to get at it is, what else can you tell us or share with us about your thoughts on capital deployment. Whether it be acquisitions or investment in the business or indeed dividend policy and share repurchase that we should be looking for as not so much offset but positioning the company for growth this year as well as in the out years.\nSteve Hemsley: I offer a response that probably won't be very surprising and then ask Dave, if he has any comments. I would \u2013 our capital postures have been changed and in the broadest sense and they're all oriented towards balance of building for the future in continuing to grow and diversify and enterprise in a thoughtful and logical way and then making sure that we are returning capital to shareholders in a efficient as well as balanced way. So we will continue to invest organically actually first and foremost and you can see those investments play out in our Optum business and there are also investments in the UnitedHealthcare business and I would also offer that a lot of our internal capital spending as you set in the financials are particularly related to technology in continuing to advance in a refine, a better and more modern health system that we can propagate across the country. We continue to balance that with external growth and we continue to maintain a disciplined appetite to continue to grow and expand our business, where we see opportunities to either expand or position a market share that we are looking to pursue market position or secondly cultivate a capability and much of our investment is around bringing capabilities into [bear] and adding them to our portfolio. Optum is a great example of this and our technology is its wealth. And then lastly to return capital by way of a balance between dividends which we have been advancing strongly and will continue to take an orientation to make sure that we are advancing them to a market pay out position and share buyback. Those have served us well and they've been very consistently applied and it provides a nice balance in terms of being able to continue to advance, expand and diversify the business and capture that growth, which is really the sustaining longer term growth and opportunity as well as maintaining a discipline over capital efficiency and maintain appropriate and hopefully accretive capital returns and earning returns.\nDave Wichmann: Having that be, virtually impossible to say anything in addition to our shareholders. Dave Wichmann [indiscernible] for a couple of additional comments. First probably as you've seen in this quarter. We had a nice cash flow in the quarter particularly compared to last year and we are managing cash flows and our returns on invested capital very hard and in very disciplined way. The increase in cash flows for this year to the $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion level be invested as Steve discussed. I think you've seen that, we had a very strong repurchase period in the first quarter here. Set 3 billion and 3.5 billion in shares repurchase through 2014 but clearly we are on track towards the upper end of that range at this stage. In the spirit of continuing to return capital to shareholders. As you know, each of the last three years we've increased our dividend by 30% or more that is something that we are committed to reevaluate in periodically. We really look at the outlook of our business, the capital requirements of our business and then also what our peer benchmarks are I don't think it's news to anybody that we have some room to improve there. On the M&A front, you notice there's a relatively modest investments but I think strategically important because they're aligned to, what we said at our investor day. They're really oriented more towards our Optum businesses where we see a stronger growth prospects turn these growth prospects and in that case. We think, we've acquired the leading consumer digital health platform in the country, but in addition to that. We continue to extend our reach internationally with relatively modest but strategically important investments particularly in South America, where we think there's a wonderful opportunity long-term to grow. So with that, I'll end. Thank you.\nSteve Hemsley: Thank you for the question. Next question, please\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJosh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital: Hi, thanks appreciate you guys taking the question here at the end. So I really just want to drill in to this commercial MLR ratio and make sure we are not overreacting to New York and a couple of things. The good guys in the quarter to me would be the ACA fee. So it would be helpful if you could tell what the actual ACA fee was and maybe by segment that would be particularly helpful and then the impact of whether, it looks as though with your payables up four times as much as your premium sequentially. You're probably just assuming that utilization comes back and we will figure that out, when we get to see March, April claims. And then on the bad side, hep C is $100 million of 36 basis points. Obviously not all of that is commercial and so I'm assuming maybe that's 10 basis points. So that certainly is not getting above your range and New York State I calculated you know about 7% your overall premium. So you know every 100 basis points there is seven bip. So I'm struggling to figure out, what's going to drive you above the 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range in Commercial and really want to just make sure that New York is not bigger than sort of 7% impact or something that I'm calculating. Well, we'll respond I think more in general terms and I agree there shouldn't be an overreaction and I would also agree that it is a portfolio of issues and pressures and we are kind of alerting you to that portfolio. So that is kind of context. Dan, do you want to respond?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Good morning, Josh. It's Dan. You add a lot a pieces to that. First I want to clarify, you talked about the commercial loss ratio. The commercial loss ratio guidance is 79.2% plus or minus 50 basis point. The consolidated loss ratio guidance is 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. And so as we look inside the Commercial business. We have two principal pressures, the bigger of which is the early renewal impact and having less premium. Good long-term thing, it impacts our premium in near term and then the second in the order of impact is, the Hepatitis C impact and when you put that together that gets muted on the Medicare and Medicaid side because they don't have those other dimensions we are talking about other than the Hep C. And our consolidated basis, that might suggest that a loss ratio may lean towards the higher end of the range. That's about, also I think ACA fees. Our fees in the quarter, we're in the range of about $450 million on an expense basis and then obviously from a reimbursement standpoint, we have reimbursement in the commercial business, which is higher because it has insurer fees and the reinsurer's fees. We have less in Medicaid because it's just the insurer's fee and then there isn't a mechanism in Medicare in premium to recover that. So hopefully that gives you some more context around the pieces.\nJosh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay, so you didn't even mention as a pressure in commercial overall now. Is that because it's not big enough in terms of magnitude.\nDan Schumacher: That's more of an impact on the enrollment. So you look at a risk based enrollment and some of the pressure we are seeing there and potential forward, that's more a commentary on the enrollment and less on the loss ratio.\nJoshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay. So I guess I'm still struggling to understand the commercial ratios 79.2% plus or minus 50 basis point seeing impact of more than 50 basis points. Again I know hep C is small of the early renewals, I assume have to be a huge impact then much bigger than you guys were expecting.\nUnidentified Company Representative: It's a very meaningful impact on the early renewal side, we saw more than two times the volume, we had expected.\nJoshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay.\nSteve Hemsley: But again, also a good thing in terms of it positions us and how it sustains that members and does it for a good period. So I think, while there is resulting pressure. The reality is, I think a very good business decision and a good outcome for us. Right.\nJoshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right and no impact from weather then because that wasn't mentioned.\nUnidentified Company Representative: I would tell you, as we look at weather in the quarter. It was a very smallish impact. As you look which days were the heaviest in relation to what we see a normal patterns as you look at where our densities are from a population perspective. It wasn't particularly meaningful.\nJoshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Thanks.\nSteve Hemsley: But you've a very good list, Josh. You were listening very attentively and but I think we will conclude our Q&A session for this morning as always. There an opportunity for you to talk to John and Beth and so forth through the course of the day. I just might sum up by saying UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare are tracking to the plans, we shared with you. As we told you in December. We fully expect the challenging conditions throughout 2014 and we are working through the headwinds of ACA implementations, the Medicare cuts, comparative market dynamics etc. we would have had an underlying growth rate of more than 20% absent the impact of ACA taxes in the regulatory provision. We believe we have the right plans and plays to deliver on our commitments and we know the people of this company have the talent, the experience, the innovation and the drive and are determined to succeed. So we thank you again for joining us. We will see you next quarter and this concludes this morning's call. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's program. You may now disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day."}], "2016": [{"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 4, "year": 2015, "date": "2016-01-19 15:29:18", "content": "Executives: Stephen Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer Larry Renfro - Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group and Chief Executive Officer, Optum David Wichmann - President and Chief Financial Officer Dan Schumacher - Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare Steve Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicine & Retirement Austin Pittman - Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State John Rex - Executive Vice President, Optum Jeff Alter - Chief Executive of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual Business John Prince - Executive Vice President and Chief of Operations, Optum\nAnalysts: Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Josh Raskin - Barclays Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley Chris Ray - Susquehanna Financial Group A.J.

Welcome to UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC Filing section of the Company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 19, 2016, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning. Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line with the guidance provided at our December Investor Conference with fourth adjusted earnings per share at $1.40 brining full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share to $6.45. Overall UnitedHealthcare had a positive year and finished with strong fourth quarter growth exceeding 300,000 members and growing across all its markets. Optum delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter with revenues up 70% and earnings up 46% over the prior year. Before we go into the business commentary, let me offer a brief recap of 2015. 2015 UnitedHealth Group revenue grew more than 20% to $157 billion with organic revenue growth of 10%. Our cash flows were exceptional at $9.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Our dividend increased 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share this year. United Healthcare grew to serve more than 1.7 million more people domestically as Optum grew its revenues by 42% and revenue backlog by more than 20%. Excluding the impact of individual exchange compliant products and reserves related to the initiation of a new Medicaid contract, UnitedHealth Group still grew revenues by 19% in 2015 and grew operating earnings 15% to $11.8 billion and that would have produced an adjusted earnings per share of $7, a 16% year-over-year increase again absent those items to give you an idea of the underlying strength of the enterprise. We know the individual exchanges are top of mind to you and Dave Wichmann will discuss these fully in his comments. As we said at the investor conference, the balance of our total business to well more than a 175 billion of it is driving considerably stronger and better position than this time last year. We are committed to delivering a strong 2016 performance year in growth, in financial results and in the quality of our services and net promoter score or NPS performance metrics. 2016 is off to a strong start considerably stronger than 2015. Our initial growth trends are very encouraging and our service performance for new January business is strong. Optum\u2019s revenue backlog and pipelines have never been stronger. Medical cost in the fourth quarter trended slightly better than expected and we are confident, our benefit businesses have appropriately priced our products for 2016. Our operating business platforms drive these results, so I will ask Larry Renfro to review Optum\u2019s performance for full year 2015 and Dave Wichmann to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide some UnitedHealth Group enterprise live comments. Larry?\nLarry Renfro: Thanks Steve . 2015 was without question an exceptional performance year for Optum in revenues and earnings growth. And then our preparations to setup 2016 to deliver well for the nearly 115 million people we serve. Optum\u2019s businesses have strong momentum and are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. Since beginning the one Optum journey in 2011, we have compounded revenues at 23% per year and operating earnings at 34% per year. In 2015, Optum\u2019s revenues of $67.6 billion grew 42%, including organic revenue growth of 13%. OptumRx revenues grew 51% this past year to $48 billion and even excluding the Catamaran combination posted solid double digit organic growth. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to more than $20 billion which is growth of 24% over 2014. Our full year operating margin of 6.3% reflects the increase mix of pharmacy care services revenues drive by OptumRx organic growth in five months of Catamaran business. Both OptumHealth and OptumInsight strong full year 2015 margins are sustainable and we project operating margin expansion for OptumRx in 2016. In 2015, we added to our strategic relationship portfolio which now numbers 10 and we\u2019ve remained focused on developing more of those comprehensive large scale relationships. They leverage Optum\u2019s unique end-to-end capabilities to help solve the broader challenges, customers and prospects are facing in a changing healthcare environment whether they are physicians or hospitals, health benefit sponsors, governments or consumers. To illustrate, consider our Optum360 revenue management relationship with Dignity Health where cash flows have already improved by $1.5 billion and accounts are being settled before eight days faster and where are documentation technology is helping Dignity Health physicians meet demanding ICD10 requirements even as they are realizing a 50% gain in productivity. Our consider OptumCare, our expanding care delivery business in which we are developing some of the most impactful and durable consumer relationships. Today, we serve seven million patients to more than a 150 payer relationships across our physician practices, our community based clinical services and our MedExpress neighborhood care centers. MedExpress operates at the conversions of healthcare and retail measuring success one patient at a time. MedExpress can provide as much as 90% of the care patients receive in the ER and for as little as 10% of the cost. MedExpress mitigates cost for both payers and consumers while providing high quality convenient care. We currently operate over a 160 neighborhood care centers with a goal of operating several multiples of that number five years from now. Today there are OptumCare clinics in more than 270 locations in 26 local markets having recently added pro health in the Connecticut market to that distinctive high performance practice portfolio. Our pipeline for growth is gaining momentum as well. The OptumCare approach, we expect local market norms and expectations and our doctors consistently deliver a high quality results for the communities they serve. We consistently outperform benchmarks around the acute care readmissions and skilled nursing facility stays. More than three quarters of private Medicare patients we care for are in health plans rates four starts or better and more than 96% of our patients would recommend our local care provider office to workers. For patients with complex medical conditions, our integrated care model has proven distinctive results. We deliver on average a 50% reduction in overall healthcare cost for medically complex patients with very high patient and family satisfaction. A number of OptumCare\u2019s high performing practices have been nationally recognized for their performance and council care initiatives including Monarch in Southern California and ProHEALTH in New York metro area. And finally, our healthcare services continued to deliver clear and distinctive value for Medicare recipients and payers with 98% patient satisfaction and more than one million visits to patients in their homes delivered in 2015 and further growth in 2016. With the market momentum we have today and through these constantly advancing capabilities, we expect OptumCare will remain a high growth business for many years to come. As we care other examples in future quarters that reflect Optum\u2019s growing diversification such as our military and veteran\u2019s health services or our pharmacy care services or our technology support services, you should say with even more clarity a pattern immerging. The application of data, technology and services to bring better performance helping health systems work better for everyone. Today revenues from our top 25 customer relationships at Optum have quite rubbled over the last three years. In 2015, the average customer awards has doubled across OptumHealth and OptumInsight and we expect continued strong customer retention at OptumRx, we work to bring the powerful benefits of the OptumRx merger to these clients. Common health organizations continued to enquire about how our capabilities can help them, so we are exploring potentially large and interesting new strategic relationships. In many cases, these parings could further accelerate growth in the OptumInsight backlog which now exceeds $10.4 billion and grew by more than 20% year-over-year. Within the current portion of that backlog, we already cover more than 80% of OptumInsight\u2019s full year projected 2016 revenues. We remain optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. For 2016, we are projecting revenues to well exceed $80 billion which would be growth in the area of 20% and for operating earnings to grow 30% to 34% to more than $5.55 billion. Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and now represents about 42% of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s consolidated operating earnings outlook. Now let me turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive service, product innovation and integrated clinical and network value and the result is strong, sustainable growth. UnitedHealthcare new serves 46.4 million medical members and we have leading market positions in all private health insurance segments of North and South America. Over the past five years, we have grown by nearly 13.5 million people or 40% well diversified across commercial, government programs and international offerings. This reflects the delivery of diversification and consisting competiveness of our offerings globally. UnitedHealthcare continued to strength in 2015 growing to serve 1.75 million more people domestically as they continue to improve its market share. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s full year revenues grew nearly 10% to $131.3 billion. The full year operating margins of 5.1% decreased as expected declining 70 basis points year-over-year due to the effects of public insurance exchange products. Full year commercial medical cost trends of 5.5% came in at a low end of our initial outlook one year ago. Our cost trends reflect a positive, sustainable impact of higher consumer engagement, strong alignment of incentives with care professionals grew value based relationships and improving data collection and application. We are equally pleased with immerging innovation trends in our business focused on advancing the consumer movement in healthcare. Today 25 million consumers are served through our Advocate4Me service model. People served by this innovative approach are more engaged in their health and are more effective in their healthcare decision making and are more satisfied. Today over 23 million consumers have joined our Rally Digital Health applications and we are seeing steady advances in daily active use of these services. Including importantly engagement around selecting primary care physicians better used of urging care over emergency care, screenings and higher adoption of personal health and condition management programs. And today, our Real Appeal digital medical service designed to help manage weight and reduce the onset of diabetes has been deployed to accounts representing one million people in just the last half of 2015 and with an additional half million committed for the first half of 2016. The initial results are encouraging with 46% of participants achieving a meaningful reduction of 5% or more of their body weight within 16 weeks. 5% weight loss reduces the conversion to diabetes by nearly 60% according to studies conducted by the Nation Institutive Health. Give these exceptional results, we plan to make available digitally a broader set of preventative medical services to engage people to live healthier lives to the fullest. Across UnitedHealthcare, we intend to continue to positively impact the quality of social services, condition management, cost and quality transparency, convenient care, wellness and the overall quality of life of the consumers we serve by giving them the tools like these to engage them in their health. Our work is improving the quality of patient care. In Medicare, we help close 9 million gaps in care for the seniors we serve. We will serve 1.7 million members in health plans with higher star ratings in 2017 as we expect at least 63% of our members to be in a four star plan and we will further improve that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. It is not a coincidence we are off to our strongest growth start for Medicare Advantage in company history. We expect to close first quarter with growth of around 300,000 seniors and Medicare Advantage and we are tracking well against our full year outlook of 325,000 to 400,000 people in that growth. In commercial benefits, we combine cheered networks, our clinical strategies, an innovative product designs in ways to align to a wider rate of affordable price points for employers and consumers. Today one third of our commercial customers are served through one of these more affordable plan offerings. That\u2019s double the number from five years ago. And we expect that percentage to more than double again over the next five years aiding to our exceptional growth. In Medicaid, over the past two years, we are secured new contract awards totaling more than 2 million people. Manage Medicaid continues to immerge as the ultimate long terms sustaining solution for states and we believe UnitedHealthcare offers our state customers the most distinctive and comprehensive set of capabilities. Like in Medicare and commercial, we are well positioned for 2016 growth in community and state. Turning to exchanges, we expect to start the year at around 700,000 or fewer public exchange members and expect these numbers will steadily decline over the course of the year. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance over the balance of 2016. We have withdrawn platinum products, increased prices, eliminated marketing and commissions, intensified clinical engagement and medical management with this membership group and reduced operating cost as appropriate. As a matter of prudence, we have increased our premium deficiency reserve by $65 million above our Investor Conference estimates, bringing the total fourth quarter charge to $340 million. 245 million of that charge addresses 2016\u2019s exchange compliant product exposure. This is an addition to the unreserved losses including in our 2016 outlook combined more than $1.5 billion set aside for 2016. We believe we are fully captured 2016 exposure, now based on our actual starting enrollment. And by mid-2016, we will determine to what extend if any, we will continue to offer products in the exchange market in 2017. In Medicaid, the start of the new program in Hawaii has been deferred while the state has also increased the assigned enrollment for each contracted plans which increases our estimate of revenues. We are in constructive discussions with the state concerning elements of an effective and sustainable managed Medicaid program to serve that market. As we look into 2016 and 2017, we believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace and profitably improve its market share. Fundamentally UnitedHealthcare is emerging across the spectrum of consumer driven products, service, wellness, transparency and most important care engagement and clinical quality particularly in government programs. We have room to improve but we sharp focused on NPS and the quality of the work we do in a cultured centered around helping others, we have an opportunity to offer even greater value to consumers, providers and customers are like in the coming years. Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. We are committed to strong performance in 2016 across UnitedHealthcare and Optum in service, in operations, in growth, in earnings generating and in cash flow production. We foresee cash flow is approaching $10 billion and adjusted net earnings of $7.60 to $7.80 per share. Again adjusted net earnings for us is GAAP EPS plus after tax intangible amortization. We encourage everyone to move to adjusted net earnings to enable better comparability among companies and among the analysts community. We expect about 46% to 47% of full year earnings in the first half of the year with Optum at approximately 40% of its full year plan in the first half exactly as you saw it last year and in the past. We expect the rate of our earnings growth to strengthen during 2016. Current consensus street estimates for first quarter adjusted earnings per share might be slightly strong compared to our expectations at the moment. All in, we have a strong view of 2016 and look forward to this year. Steve?\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you, Dave. At our investor conference, we offered a sense of the growing innovation and entrepreneurial activity in our company and the restless drive, our team has to grow and improve performance. On the customer side, we are committed to further elevating satisfaction for consumers, care providers and all our stakeholders to levels more often seen outside our industries to better meet the increasing expectations people and society have for healthcare. When our net promoters scores reflect people being staunch advocates for our products and businesses because of the way we make their simpler and the value we provide as they define and experience it as consumers and customers will be on the path creating truly distinctive and substantial growth and brand equity. We believe a differentiated brand and reputation will drive accelerated growth in market share for our businesses for years to come. Our goal for serving you as investors in 2016 is simple. We are committed to delivering clean, strong results this year back by a growing pipeline of opportunities for 2017 and beyond. We expect distinguish revenue growth, earnings and cash flow in 2016 that continued to reflect the diversity, breath and overall strength of our enterprise and the valuable businesses we are building. Thank you for your interest today. And operator, can we take some question this morning. One per analyst, please. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, hi, good morning. Could you just talk about what the factors were that caused you take increase your booking for anticipated losses in 2016. I guess maybe, I think it was 45 million higher on the exchange side and 20 million higher on the Medicaid contract, if I got that right?\nStephen Hemsley: Yes, you do. And it\u2019s really just purely updating and I think Dan Schumacher can take you through that.\nDan Schumacher: Good morning, Matt.\nMatthew Borsch: Good morning.\nDan Schumacher: So, you are right. We did increase our loss expectations for 2016. And when it came to really as we closed out the year, we took - we took a prudent past year on the \u201815 impact and then we carried that through to 2016 outlook and then we adjusted further for a little higher enrollment expectation for 2016, so those are the elements that played into the increase in both the \u201815 impact and the assumed losses for \u201816 in the individual exchange compliant plan offerings. And then with regard to the Medicaid potion, that\u2019s simple, just a function of a higher enrollment expectation as the number of carries was reduced from four down to three. But when you put that all together in total as we close the year, it was about a $100 million of impact beyond what our guidance had assumed from December and -\nMatthew Borsch: Okay.\nDan Schumacher: So our base business, the vast majority of our business performed exceptionally well and we delivered fully in line with the expectations as we closed out \u201815. And then as we look to \u201816, we\u2019ve incorporated that again fully into our outlook as we reaffirm out guidance for \u201816.\nMatthew Borsch: And if I could just one related question, in the four quarter on individual enrollment, I think your total book is about 1.2 million, how did that change as a result of the maybe in - at the end of the year and then coming into this year as a result of the coop insolvencies and related instability in the individual market?\nStephen Hemsley: So, and I think the last time we talked, we talked about our individual exchange compliant being about 700,000 of that 1.2 million you\u2019ve referenced. As we closed out the year, that came in at about 650,000 lines and then we\u2019ll expect that to grow as we step into January and then it will start to shrink again over the course of the year as some of those enrollment, and will these trade out.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay, thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: And that we just say is kind of an overarching flats and our goal is in this area is to be careful conservative and to make sure that we really capture all this, so that we really do have the rest \u201816. Next question please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.\nJosh Raskin: Hi thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little about Medicare Advantage another CMS data is relatively preliminary but certainly seems like you guys are well on page to beat the 400,000 for the full year at the high end. So just curious, you know doesn\u2019t sound you got much star improvement this year, so what made your products more attractive, is it more retention, is it you know more agents or coming from other plans, just any color on where this is - where the growth is coming from?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. It is good growth as Dave indicated, but Steve Nelson can really respond to that and it is a very positive story.\nSteve Nelson: Thanks Steve. Hi Josh, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. Yes, very positive about the growth that we are seeing coming through the AP and it\u2019s little inside into that growth. First, it\u2019s important to remember that it comes as a result of and after a couple year of really hard work as we repositioned this product to some of that change in Medicare Advantage program introduced premiums, created a more aligned engaged network and relationships with our providers and meaningful improvement in stars as you mentioned. And you know second, we really like where the growth is coming from and so I think Dave mentioned in his comments about 300,000 or so as a result of AP, about third of that comes from Group, so really inside into that pricing in that membership. And then within the individual business, meaningful improvement in our retention also has added to this growth. And this is membership that you know we\u2019ve been engaged with and they\u2019ve been involved in our clinical programs. And it\u2019s very evenly spread across geography and products, but the stability of our products, the evolution of our portfolio is really resonating in the market. And so that\u2019s all contributes to the growth and we expect this as a Medicare Advantage product to continue to grow as we look to 2017 and beyond.\nJosh Raskin: And Steve just a quick follow-up on that, do you have a percentage of how many are coming from previously not in MA whether that\u2019s agents or tradition people service versus how many are coming from other plans competing plans?\nSteve Nelson: It\u2019s a little early to give that kind of color but I would say in general in terms of how we look at the membership, it\u2019s very much in line with our expectations.\nJosh Raskin: Okay, thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.\nAndy Schenker: Hey, thanks. Maybe just going back to the exchange enrollment real quickly, just a few on the membership, maybe if you could talk a little bit about how your positioning or membership growth compared to the existing states versus the 11 new states you entered and then relates that obviously still a little over week left in enrollment, just how your - you know what kind of forecast you are expecting for total enrollment, I assume you are trying to - you assume there is a big jump in the last week or two but just how we should think about that you know 700,000 related to expectation last two weeks? Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Sure, good morning, Andy. So on the exchange enrollment specifically, the 700,000 as Dave mentioned beginning January, we ended the year with just about 500,000 so that jumped up to about 700,000 as of one-one. We\u2019d expect that over the balance of the open enrollment period to grow something underneath about - to about 800,000, something a little sound of that. And then we would expect that to where off as you pace through the year as those members trade out. In terms of the where it\u2019s coming from, I would tell you that the net growth in coming with a greater orientation toward those new states as well as expansion areas but a little bit of mix of both.\nAndy Schenker: Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Okay, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Ray with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChris Ray: Good morning. Thanks. Just on the last question, I got a little confused with the numbers, Dan just on the 800,000 versus 700,000, 500,000 ending the year and 650ish thousand now, can you just confirm, did you end the year 650,000 or was it 500,000? And then my real question with regard to all of this, do you know how many the people that have currently signed up were enrolled with you guys last year versus new membership? Thanks a lot.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. So just to be clear, we ended - we ended the year with 650,000 lives in individual exchange compliant offerings, inside of that 500,000 of them were on exchange. So the balance 150,000 was off exchange. And then as we step into January that exchange component which ended the year about 500 grows to about 700 and then as you move towards the end of the open enrollment period, it grows further up towards 800,000 something sound of that and then works it straight down over the year. The off exchange is more level than what we experience in the on exchange. And then to your last question about mix of enrollment, more than half of the enrollment is new to us and a little less than half of the enrollment is existing enrollment base.\nChris Ray: Right, thanks a lot.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you, next please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Just might ask, focus my question on Medicaid, both, do you update your membership with one player dropping out and eye was had enough move the needle, I guess we\u2019ve had some companies comment on concern about profitability in Medicaid year-to-year, can you give us a play over there? And then finally on that the health insure the question for 2017, if you got an clarity from CMS where as it relates to either Medicaid or Medicare and how they are going to treat that, those dates I guess?\nStephen Hemsley: That is quite an impressive single question A.J. so we\u2019ll break that up into pieces and we\u2019ll start with Austin on Medicaid.\nAustin Pittman: Sure. So hey, A.J. this is Austin, how are you?\nA.J. Rice: Good.\nAustin Pittman: Right, so first of all, I think you\u2019re asking about Iowa. We did increase our membership outlook and assumptions for Iowa as the state moves from four players to three. As far as the sustainability, the program, I think first of all as we state of four, we are really honored to been selected to serve the people of Iowa. We continued to be - feel good about the relationship that we develop at the state. We\u2019re in very productive conversation with them about really tried in true methods to ensure long term stability. And so we feel good about where that\u2019s headed and it will become a long term and very durable part of our portfolio. And with regard to the rates overall, as you know states are always pressured, there is nothing new in that. I think we are very pleased with our business, most pleased with the value that we\u2019ve been able bring the customers into the consumer over the years. We\u2019ve got a very strong management team, very locally deployed, enable to manage these populations and really help people in very vulnerable situations and then deliver value for the long term. So I think we feel good about pressured but stable rate environment and the growth in this market.\nA.J. Rice: And that\u2019s been really distinctive in terms of the rate environments, the same pressures that exist every year.\nStephen Hemsley: Absolutely, yeah. Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. A.J. it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. On the health insurers tax, you know, we miss if I didn\u2019t mention that, from our perspective obviously the tax just increases the underlying cost of healthcare and as a result makes healthcare less affordable. So as we look at the elimination of it for 2017, we are certainly encouraged by that and frankly we\u2019ve been long support, you know that\u2019s permanent repeal. Now with that said, I\u2019ll tell you in terms of the impact, in Medicaid, we expected to be no impact. In the commercial business because that\u2019s prices on a policy year basis and the tax is living on a calendar year basis. There is no impact over three years but there are some differences by year and we expect it actually be a drag on our 2016 earnings. We\u2019ve estimated that impact to be about a $100 million pretax or about $0.06 earnings per share. And then lastly the Medicare of business, the tax has not been part of the rate setting process previously, so we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be for 2017 either.\nA.J. Rice: Okay.\nStephen Hemsley: That pressure is covered in our guidance. We basically observe that in our guidance given the strength of the start of the year. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Just go back to the exchanges. I guess if we shift the premium does it from 2015 as of 2016, are you saying that you expect to lose more money on exchanges in 2016 than either in 2015 and if so why would that be the case I guess you had a chance to price up the core business?\nStephen Hemsley: Well, I\u2019ll have Dan answer this, but I think as a matter of prudence, what we are doing is making sure that we have covered ourselves appropriately in \u201816, so that means we set aside more money between the reserve that have set aside and what we have covered it within our guidance that it\u2019s clearly out purpose. We are really focused on making sure that this item is really covered at \u201816 and so I think that\u2019s what you should read through in terms of our activity. Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So if you move the premium deficiency reserve and reset the years and look at it, you know on the individual exchange compliant plans within \u201815, we launched about $475 million on the \u201815 policy year. And the \u201816 policy year as Dave Wichmann had mentioned, we\u2019ll lose more than $500 million. So, and we\u2019ve got about a 10% increase in the loss assumption balance against about a 25% to 30% growth assumption in the underlying enrollment base. And the reason that we\u2019re able to do that is to the points that you mentioned, obviously we came in with very strong pricing, you know that mid-double-digits. And further we\u2019ve made some strong refinements to our product portfolio, those are the largest contributors. But beyond that, we\u2019re also working every single data, the tuner operating environment as well as focus our clinical interventions in our network orientation around this population.\nKevin Fischbeck: I guess you are saying is the loss of be in - and then you mentioned like path that goes to be new states and new geographies, is that - is that why that the losses, is that why have loss is really at all going up or do you think that the core business is actually getting get worse as well?\nDan Schumacher: No, I think it\u2019s going up because we got enrollment growth and then balanced against that is our pricing, our product positioning, our clinical interventions, our operating environment and then improvements we\u2019re making there.\nStephen Hemsley: And I might point out that, this is what we are providing, we are being careful in terms of making sure that we\u2019ve covered this off. These are not losses that we are sustaining these are but we have protected ourselves against in terms of \u201816.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take the next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.\nPeter Costa: Thanks for the question. Previously you said that you are expecting $0.13 to $0.15 or 200 to 225 million of additional losses from the exchange business in 2016, it seems like that grew a little bit, and you talked about over half a billion now in losses including the $245 million PDR. But my question gets to you know if that\u2019s the right number, the $0.13 to $0.15 and maybe correct me if I am wrong, that would be you know say $0.14 at the midpoint added to your the midpoint of your 760 to 780 guidance, so let\u2019s call that $7.84 of potential earnings, that\u2019s only 12% growth from the $7 number that you have excluding those the individual business item, yet last year you grew 16% to get to that $7 in terms of earnings, which of your core businesses is the one responsible for the slowdown from 16% to 12%?\nStephen Hemsley: Well you know Peter, those are projected numbers. We would think that we could perform even more strongly. So I think that by just isolating that against a beginning of the year range may not be a fair comparison in comparing your 16 to 12. Actually as we take a look across our spectrum of businesses, we really don\u2019t see any of these businesses in a position that they are actually, I would say they are all stronger than they were as we - compared to this time last year as we entered clearly across the board in Optum. The strength of the portfolio from one end to the other has advanced. And in terms of UnitedHealthcare, I think all those businesses have strengthen the - and I think are positioning on the exchange has strengthen. So I think my view on this is that is a pretty positive outlook.\nPeter Costa: The 15%, you are telling, the difference between the 16% and the 12% then it\u2019s PPD but perhaps is that what you would say?\nStephen Hemsley: No, I am not sure you can, it might be - take that one element and then project against estimated earnings range as we go out, we could be even stronger than that.\nPeter Costa: Okay.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.\nGary Taylor: Hi good morning. This is question for Larry I think. When we look at Optum inside, operating income was up a $200 million sequentially, same case last year was up about a $100 million sequentially in the four quarter. Can you just remind us the source of the seasonality in the operating income for OptumInsight, please?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I think we\u2019ll Larry kind of give you some sense of the growth of momentum there and then respond to that specific question.\nLarry Renfro: Garry, it\u2019s Larry. I think that you\u2019ve seen over the last few years that the fourth quarter is obviously a dominant quarter for us that will stay that way. If I had to break it down, I\u2019ll give you three areas to think about. Lot of time since beginning of the year, we\u2019re making investments and those investments payoff in the fourth quarter and you see a little bit of that happening, we\u2019re also in implementation mode they are in the year and those implementation then installations also come true in the four quarter and that enables us to obviously have a stronger position at that point. When you look at the products and services, there are specific products like obviously distribution that goes along with open enrolment but also our pay for performance and incentives will also hit in the fourth quarter. So we don\u2019t see that changing, we see that being the pattern that Optum in general will be experiencing.\nGary Taylor: Okay, thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.\nChristine Arnold: Thank you. Impressive increase in backlog for OptumInsight, can you remind us if you gave us some parameters Investor Day, how to translate that into expected revenue overtime? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Christine, it\u2019s John Rex, good morning. Yeah, when you thing about the backlog $10.4 billion backlog you\u2019ve seen inside some of the guidance points that we provided on that. You should expect about 60% of that to be recognized in the 2016 revenues so that equates about 80% of the full year revenue outlook. Another way to look at that is that the average duration of the backlog runs about 20 months. And these are being fairly consistent numbers and I expect that could be fairly consistent as you look ahead also.\nLarry Renfro: So Christine, it\u2019s Larry. One think I would add to what John said is that as of now about 90% of our 2016 revenue is locked in, obviously that\u2019s part of the backlog.\nChristine Arnold: Okay, perfect, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.\nSarah James: Thank you. I just have one quick follow-up here before my question is, so you\u2019d mentioned earlier that there are conversations with States Medicaid rates are tried in true methods that insurance stability, is that mean, I am wondering this is referencing changes in the risk adjustment methodology that can redo some premium get backs or are you talking about our aspects of tried in two methods?\nAustin Pittman: So, this is Austin. Really I was talking about a whole portfolio of method, so you can think about care coordination, network management, the level of transparency that we address, the rates and immerging experience overtime with States. And so you could narrow it down any one, we get a very long term history of 20 and 30 year relationship, so a lot of success in how we work with States and so that\u2019s what let us to feel so confident and comfortable with where we do with Iowa and really with our whole portfolio States.\nSarah James: Got it. And just I know some of your peers are trying to get those risk adjustment seems back, is that was an indication that United where those well but it sounds like based on other aspects that you are negotiating right?\nStephen Hemsley: Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t comment any further in - any further detail about the specifics of any conversation with any State.\nSarah James: Got it. Then in the past you\u2019ve talked about opportunities for growth on Medicaid outside RFP cycle like States assigning our PSS or covering in other products, do you still see that as a possibility and is there anything near term?\nStephen Hemsley: So, let me comment on the pipeline overall which I think is very strong. You know States continue to move and look to managed care as solutions for their healthcare needs and that movement continues as States have really embraced this. I think that activity, in fact I think we expect to respond to over 20 RFPs this year that will be implemented in \u201816, \u201817 and on into \u201818. So again when I say the pipeline is strong, it\u2019s very strong. That\u2019s heavily weighted towards more complex population, so that\u2019s really what you are talking about when you speak to LTSS and the movement of those complex populations from fee for service and to managed Medicaid, we\u2019ve got one of the largest books business, in that space we\u2019ve got a very long history at dealing with these very vulnerable people and delivering real value to those individual, so - as well as value to the States. So I think we feel and Dave mentioned it in the opening comments, I think uniquely positioned between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to really serve these populations and help them live healthier lives year-over-year and deliver value back to the States and the process. So I think our outlook for that continued movement even within States where we\u2019re already providing traditional tenant population managed care to continue grew into those complex populations.\nSarah James: Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho U.S.A.\nSheryl Skolnick: Thanks so much. First let me step back, I mean against the backdrop of a somewhat challenging situation that exchanges, let me in this stand fall complement everyone from UHC to Optum to senior management the way you performed and handled during 2015. I am impressed by especially the fact that somewhere I sit that privacy made with the cost structure as well as positioning the business. I remember United having a better cost structure, better positioning going into a growth year in a very long time if ever than you\u2019ve go now. So let me ask a question about one of those things that interesting to me that you performed well on which is the cash flow. It\u2019s I guess multi, part one, why the strength; two, does this change in anyway your thoughts around share repurchases versus deleveraging versus investments in the business for 2016; and three, you know if you are going to - it seems like 2016 guidance is perhaps a little bit more conservative, it\u2019s not a little modest on the cash flow, and I was just wondering what you think might change?\nStephen Hemsley: Dave will touch on beginning of that and then we\u2019ll get into the share buyback, invest, et cetera as part two.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Sheryl. First thank you for the recognition of the hard work this team has done this year particularly in the last half of the year to get this cost structures aligned and to really position its business for growth in 2016 and beyond. Our cash flows were exceptionally strong I think you know from past calls and discussions that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re very, very, very focused on cash flows and in particular managing balance sheet elements of our business and the strength of the cash flows are the departure from what our original expectations where really around collecting receivables more quickly and paying claims more in line with what our contractual requirements are as opposed to paying it early. So just better working capital management and really contributed to that. As it relates to within what our priorities are for that is around share repurchases, deleveraging and investment, we are going to continue to maintain a very balance posture with respect to those things. Obviously it\u2019s important that we continue to deliver the business as we had indicated that we would over the course of 18 months following the Catamaran transaction and we continue to be committed to doing so. Part of that is that our expectations that will continue to curtail our share repurchases at least for 2016, you know less extreme circumstances arise but for 2016 to about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in cash use. And as you can probably suspect by the activity that\u2019s underway in our business, we continue to be a strong investor and new capabilities organically in our business but also through quested means. As it relates to 2016 and the cash flow, it\u2019s certain jumping off about $9.7 billion cash flow year with stronger earnings expectations for 2016, you would expect would achieve higher cash flows. And as a result, we used language of $9.5 to $10 billion in cash flows are now taking closer to $10 billion. And we\u2019ll take a hard look at that over the course of the first quarter and reassess whether not we can push that number forward. But clearly the business is operating well from the balance sheet management perspective, we\u2019ll do all we can do to move that the cash flow number forward.\nSheryl Skolnick: Excellent, thank you so much.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. I just had a one follow-up first on the exchanges. At the Investor Day, I know you talked about assuming around negative a 15% margin in the exchanges, just as you work through sort of the updated math is, is that still how we should be thinking about that or sort of different relative to that number? And then just a follow-up question, just interested outside of the exchange just on the membership front, how membership ended up developing for the rest of the commercial risk business for the 2016 enrollment period most notably in the small group segment? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. We\u2019ll let Dan comment on the first on the first and then Jeff also kind of speak to the business in \u201816.\nDan Schumacher: Good morning, Scott. So where we landed on a policy year basis as we closed our 2014, our policy year losses on the exchanges were in that mid-double-digit rate, mid-teens range that we talked about in the Investor Conference, so 15%, 16%. And if you look at 2016 on a policy year basis, we expect that to moderate some, we\u2019d be into the low-double digits from a margin percentage basis with higher enrollment base, lower percentage margin losses again on those things that I talked about earlier, so the strength of our pricing, the repositioning of our product portfolio and then our management efforts underneath that. So hopefully that provide the sense for what you are looking for and then Jeff on the enrollment.\nJeff Alter: Sure. Good morning, Scott. This is Jeff Alter. So we closed out \u201815 with very strong growth across both our fully insured and sub-funded product. I would say driving a good part of that was increase retention of our existing clients in certain markets we saw the market come back to our pricing particularly in small group. We also had the opportunity to win back a very large part of the health republic small group block in New York in our rates. And as you recall, from early \u201814 one of our headwinds was that health republic pricing against our small group block in New York, so we were in position to win that back during the four quarter of \u201815, which is good. We also couple with very strong specialty sales, our vision in dental products are selling really well. And I think it plays to sort of our value in the market place, our strong brand, our consisting pricing and the ability for the folks to take advantage of our you know increasing innovation in the market place, the service that we deliver and our efforts to make the healthcare system a little simple for our members. So we\u2019re encouraged by the growth that we had over the last 18 months, we see that momentum continuing as we paced into \u201816 and feel good about what that will deliver in \u201816 and \u201816 and beyond for our shareholders and our members.\nScott Fidel: Okay, thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Pretty positive and so many we\u2019ll just take two more questions and then as you know John and Brett will available through the course of the day for the - for questions and any other areas of interest. So maybe two more questions, please.\nOperator: And we can take our first question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi Group. Please go ahead.\nRalph Jacoby: Thanks, good morning. Just want to go back to cash flow, again seemed even stronger than usual. Are you holding back claims at all with ICD10 implementation and maybe just generally speaking, are you seeing any impact at this point from sort of coding in a QD perspective relative to your expectations? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Not at all, but I\u2019ll let Dave handle that and others who want to comment on coding. But that - those are not issues at all. Dave?\nDavid Wichmann: I am sure what to add to that. Not at all, those are not issues at all. No, this is just purely really more refined cash flow management principals across the company. The enterprise is doing well and really managing cash flows. Obviously the performance of the business stands, exchanges is strong and then we coupled out with the balance sheet management. We are not holding claims or doing anything other than paying them in accordance with contractual terms, it\u2019s part of the value that comes from more integrated UnitedHealth Group then what we\u2019ve experienced in the past with more fragmented healthcare platforms or claims education platforms as we continue to move towards a common set of technologies, working more closely with Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of strong cash flow.\nStephen Hemsley: And on in terms of ICD10, maybe we\u2019ll go real quick to UnitedHealthcare as it relates to them and then flip to Optum and talk about more broadly the industry and what we are seeing.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Ralph, it\u2019s Dan Schumacher. From an ICD10 standpoint, there is really nothing to update from the Investor Conference and my comments there, the reality is we are paying tens of millions of claims in the ICD10 that code set. And as you look inbound volumes, rejection rates, auto adjudication rates, throughputs, ending inventory all the way through that process stream, I would tell you all of that is in line. And so there is nothing getting hung up, nothing getting slow down. In today\u2019s point really around the cash flow, it really comes down to just managing better to contract terms as well have more of our business on common platforms which allows us to do those kinds of offsets.\nStephen Hemsley: In terms of OptumInsight, sure, I always - we believe we have an extremely strong product line that were offering that\u2019s increasing productivity and results and I\u2019ll ask John Prince to comment on that.\nJohn Prince: I think Ralph in terms of ICD10, we\u2019ve been backed within that and preparing ICD10 for years. In terms of working for our customers, we\u2019ve actually had great results. One of the products that have the results of that compares to the coding, we\u2019ve actually had a very distinctive product in the market and the customers have used have actually have seen a significant increase in production versus traditional products to the market.\nStephen Hemsley: Thanks you, so one last question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take that question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.\nAna Gupte: Yes, thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Peter\u2019s question and your response around. What I thought, I heard this was upside to your guidance for 2016 and I am just looking at although the things that have developed we\u2019ve got a week through season, you pull forward even more losses from exchange in Medicaid, pricing looks pretty good, your reason stays stable have gone year-over-year by three days, your star membership rebalancing looks good as well and special enrolment period is maybe a tailwind, are there any headwinds are missing or should we think that there could be a upside to your consolidated carry show in your margins, that\u2019s your projecting to \u201816?\nStephen Hemsley: Well that is an excellent list, I am not sure I could have done better myself. You know I just think it is the 19th of January, I think we should be careful in terms of how we discussing our results, we have to truly work through the balance of our exchange, we do think we have reserve for it and consider that appropriately into our \u201816 numbers. And as I said it\u2019s the 19th of January and I think that we should you know more forward thoughtfully and prudently in our business. So I think those are the factors. In terms of headwinds, I think we said before we have less than before but we clearly have to play out the year and that\u2019s what we intend to do. I think our focus is to really deliver a very clean, strong financial year to the market place to continue advance our business, continue to innovate, you know continue diversify across both the platform of UnitedHealthcare and Optum and kind of that\u2019s our focus. I think we are always endower to try to perform better, but I think our guidance right now is very appropriate range and I am assuming you\u2019ve taken some of the input in terms of how the quarters might play out from our commentary in our teleconference. So I think we\u2019ll end up with that. And once again I\u2019ll thank you joining us today and I\u2019ll leave with few closing thoughts kind of as businesses, Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we think really advanced their capabilities significantly in 2015 and UnitedHealth Group\u2019s revenues and operating earnings grew significantly as cash flows increased as we talked about over 20% and our dividend has increased and we will certainly address that in the middle of the year as our custom. UnitedHealthcare served more than 1.7 million people domestically growing virtually in every market that we serve and Optum grew its revenues by 42% and its backlog by more than 20%. In 2016, we expect to continue and accelerate this grow trend and carried into 2017 and beyond. We intend to further differentiate our products, our services by focusing on consistently high quality in everything we do and creating real value for customers and consumers on their terms. We remained committed to delivering clean, strong financial result as I said for our shareholders this year with a growing pipeline of future opportunities. So we appreciate your interest today. This concludes our call and as I said John and Brett will be available through the course of the day. We thank you for your attention. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 15, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review UnitedHealth Group's third quarter results. Our business continues to grow as we develop in respond to large and emerging market opportunities across both the healthcare benefits and services sectors. Healthcare markets worldwide continued to evolve with nations and market participants of all types seeking to build better healthcare systems that are more informed and modern, lower cost simpler and more responsive to consumers. Organizations throughout healthcare are searching for ways to improve by leveraging data and information to more effectively deliver quality care that is measurable and delivered with greater precision and consistency in response to ever increasing pressures around costs, access in transparency. We have consciously positioned UnitedHeathcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group to deliver practical innovation and significant value in this environment. UnitedHealth Group's third quarter revenues grew 26.6% year-over-year to $41.5 billion, including strong 10% organic revenue growth across our businesses. Consolidated net earnings of $1.65 per share were in line with our expectations as was the net earnings margin which decreased by just over 1% year-over-year reflecting the greater mix of pharmacy care services as well as early stage lower margin individual exchange business, lower levels of reserve development and accelerated investments and improving medicare stars quality principally closing gaps in care for the seniors we serve. Year-to-date, we have grown net earnings per share by 14% on revenue growth of 17%. Our return on equity of 19% reflects the balance sheets of capital and organic initiatives to build our business. Quarter end days claims payable increased two days sequentially and one day year-over-year. And cash flows from operations continued to be strong at more than 170% of net income this quarter. Year-to-date, cash flows of $6.2 billion have grown by 11% and represented a strong 135% of [indiscernible] income for the nine-month period. I'll ask Larry Renfro to provide a review of Optum and then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and from UnitedHealth Group Enterprise comments. Larry, you want to take?\nLarry Renfro: Thanks, Steve. Optum continues to innovate, to address rising market needs particularly those of larger more sophisticated organization which have complex health, care service deliver and management challenges. Our businesses are producing strong sustainable growth across the board.  Optum's revenues of $19.3 billion, grew 61% year-over-year this quarter. Our results include Catamaran within OptumRx results for the first time and reflect exceptional overall organic revenue growth of 15%. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues by more than $1 billion or 25% year-over-year to more than $5 billion this quarter. Third quarter operating margin of 5.9% reflects the increased mix of pharmacy care services revenues as well as integration in intangible amortization costs related to Catamaran. Both OptumHealth and OptumInsight delivered double-digit percentage operating margins in the [indiscernible]. We continue to focus on the opportunities to dramatically elevate value for customers in five large growth markets. Clinical care, pharmacy care services, information and technology solutions, government services, and international. Our one Optum approach means we build strong, strategic and senior enterprise-level relationships that transcend individual product categories and point solutions. We start by listening closely to our clients, so we understand the issues from their perspectives. We then bring deep experience, creativity strategic partnerships in our own differentiated capabilities in healthcare combined with responsive and practical operational solutions. This can lead to working sessions which often lead to pipeline, backlog in revenue and earnings.  Optum360 is a good case in point. It has grown to 7500 employees, serving 1600 hospitals, and is helping manage more than $50 billion of their billings. Just last week, customers surveyed by the Black Book a leading research organization ranked Optum360 offerings as the best in the three key product categories for the sector, and we are still in the early stages as hospitals and health systems shift to professionally managed revenue approaches.  Domestically and in other nations, we are in discussions with high profile healthcare organizations regarding our wide range of technology and information enabled services. We are exploring significant opportunities to serve the healthcare needs of U.S. Federal Government program and talking with prominent healthcare organizations about innovative technology infrastructure and application services and a comprehensive suite of technology enabled payor services. Any one or more of these has potential to develop into a multiyear multibillion-dollar strategic relationship. Across Optum, this type of proactive approach is driving positive results. Third quarter backlog OptumInsight exceeds $10 billion in value and grew 34% year-over-year on an external basis. Our pipeline is continuing to grow at an exceptional rate as well. The median deal size for OptumHealth is doubled over the past three years. We are delivering more care to more people, to the more payors at Optum Care. We now deliver care to more than 7 million people annually through our Optum Care businesses. Market interest in OptumRX continues to grow in response to the value we can drive through more integrated downstream drug benefit and care management efforts, especially around the growing specialty and pharmaceutical segment. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has authorized agencies under its purview to conduct innovative healthcare research with Optum Labs, using Optum Labs big data resources. These indicators should help give you a sense of both our continuing progress and the meaningful opportunities we're developing. We will continue to execute on the details for our clients, with a focus on quality and service and further build our growing reputation for being the trusted partner that gets the job done. We are optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond.  Now let me turn it over to Dave.\nDave Wichmann: Thank you, Larry. United healthcare continues to differentiate its products on the foundations of distinctive quality, service, innovation and value. As a result, UnitedHealthcare has grown domestically to serve nearly 300,000 more people in the third quarter, 1.5 million more people this year, and nearly 1.7 million more people over the past 12 months. We'll enter 2016 with even more distinctive products, capabilities and relationships, and we expect to continue to deliver impressive levels of growth next year as well.  UnitedHealthcare's third quarter revenues of $32.8 billion grew year-over-year by $2.8 billion or 9.2%, all organic. The UnitedHealthcare operating margin of 5.7% decreased as expected, declining just over 1% year-over-year due to lower levels of reserve development, solid growth in early-stage, lower margin public insurance exchange products, and increased investments in Medicare Stars quality. We continue to expect a full year consolidated care ratio of 80.8% plus or minus 50 basis points likely above the mid-point of that range based on our year-to-date experience. The annual care ratio is being modestly affected by the performance of our new public exchange benefit programs which now served nearly 550,000 people. Like others we observe market-wide data this past spring that suggested the risk pool served by public exchanges would require more medical services than original expectations. Rather than wait for our own experience with our new members to fully developed, we increased rates and repositioned certain products market by market for 2016, and we expect improved performance next year. We will expand to 11 new markets in 2016, and we continue to expect exchanges to develop and mature over time into a strong viable growth market for us. We've accelerated the uptake of our medical care quality programs to achieve star ratings beyond the strongly improved levels that the CMS recently published for payment year 2017. Our Medicare stars improvement does come with a related increase in medical costs. We are confident. We have implemented the necessary steps to achieve our goal of 80% or more of our members in four-star or greater programs by payment year 2018. Star quality improvements will strengthen our reimbursement rates in 2016, 2017, and 2018, in which are Medicare advantage program's benefit offerings and further our growth and financial position. Our 2015 commercial medical cost trend outlook continues to be biased towards the lower portion of our 5.5% to 6.5% full year forecast. In total, UnitedHealthcare has maintained nearly 6% operating margin year-to-date in 2015, identical to the year-to-date margin at this point in 2014. [Driven] by year-to-date organic revenue growth of more than $9 billion UnitedHealthcare has advanced earnings from operations by $540 million which is a growth rate of more than 10%. All three of our benefits businesses are producing strong results.  Let's turn a review of a couple examples that illustrate how we worked locally and use technology to serve the two most important participants in healthcare, the doctor and the patients. We are increasingly aligned with physicians and hospitals, and we continue on our course to deliver $65 billion or more in care annually by 2018 through value-based care contracts. Today these programs touch as many of 13 million of our consumers delivered in part through more than 650 accountable care arrangements. This includes growth of more than 160 new accountable care arrangements so far this year alone. In many instances, these care providers and UnitedHealthcare bring in Optum to help and manage population risk and improve operational performance on a more systematic organization-wide basis. Larry has given you a feel for how this trend positively affects demand for Optum's services. Let me give you a few more examples. Together with Optum, we are also supporting physicians' operational needs with Link which we have discussed before. Link is a cloud based digital platform that provides secure workspace and connectivity between physician offices and health plans, enabling them to efficiently communicate and transact business. By year-end 2015, Link will be serving more than 600,000 physicians nationwide. We offer them connectivity to 75 distinct dedicated applications relevant to their operations. We continue to grow both the installed customer base and the portfolio of applications and capabilities. Our ability to fully serve physicians practices with core transactions and information exchange as well as scheduling referral processes, transparency, and other services. On the patient side with Optum, we increasingly focus on the local community and deliver care and services in people's homes. You have heard about our house call program in Medicare, and we have begun using it in targeted commercial and Medicaid patient situations as well. The more than 1 million house calls, our physicians and nurse practitioners will execute this year increases our medical spend upfront. They encourage people to get annual care visits with our physician, appropriate vaccinations, and so on. The benefits are substantial. We have more satisfied consumers with better healthcare quality, and we protect them from potentially higher medical costs down the road. Consumer satisfaction and retention are significantly strengthened by the house calls experience. At the community level, we have hundreds of community health workers on the ground, helping address the root causes of healthcare issues for Medicaid members with complex medical conditions. We meet with them in their homes and help them access the health and social services they need to better manage their health. This includes addressing housing, employment, access to healthy food and nutrition as well as transportation and other public support services. Again UnitedHealthcare is improving the quality and consumer satisfaction while helping to reduce exposure to potentially higher costs from untreated or undertreated conditions. Our people are also on-site in hospitals, helping with discharge and follow-up care planning. They are in physicians' offices helping address gaps in care and documenting Medicare quality compliance. And they are on the phone and on the web treating every interaction as an opportunity to add value for the consumer by helping them understand the actions they need to take to improve their health. You can see the benefit programs in approaches like these in our results. Growth in local commercial markets, where our efforts to be more local are having a positive effect, distinguished and ongoing growth in service to large self-funded employers who are among the most informed and discriminating in assessing service, quality, innovation and total value. Consistent Medicaid awards from States which focused on elements of quality, service, and total value in their valuation process. In just the past few weeks, we have been honored to be selected by the State of Michigan and the State of Texas for program expansions, and we recently finalized our commitments to serve the [state of IOLA] as a culmination of their award process. And our Medicare stars quality is sharply higher for 2016 and 2017. Thanks to our employees and the strong performance of the care providers who have worked collaboratively with us to better serve seniors. We believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace, profitably improving its market share as a direct result of the quality, consumer satisfaction, and total value we deliver. Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Considering together both the positives and pressures of the first nine months of this year, we continued to expect our full year 2015 results will fall within the range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share, and we would remind you that that range absorbs $0.10 per share for Catamaran and compares favorably with our original outlook of $6 to $6.25 per share. We continue to expect a further lift in the rate of earnings per share growth in 2016. The range of street estimates for the next year it's quite wide and we expect to be within that range, but not surprisingly, we would begin in a more conservative posture or range as we have in prior years. We were the first specific questions on 2016 financial performance to December 1, when we host our Annual Investor Conference in New York. Let me turn it back to Steve.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you, Dave. So Larry and Dave had given some sense for why we continue to be optimistic about our potential to deliver value, throughout the broad healthcare system and to grow. You heard some of our touch tones in their comments, relationships, built around for us collaboration and mutual respect for the challenges in delivering healthcare improving it, and making it simpler for the people involved. Innovation, developing products and processes that truly help people solve real problems, and then embedding and driving these ideas to scale quickly to improve the overall system. Quality measured by health consumers, physicians and other customers to find it and feel it. Responsive and compassionate service which goes in hand-in-hand with quality and defines peoples' healthcare experience, our aspiration is to serve others on their terms not ours. Satisfaction and value which together capture how well you bring all these elements together to help people in differentiated ways. We believe executing well on these elements at scale with nearly 200,000 dedicated people pulling in the same direction will make a difference for those we serve and drive distinctive sustaining growth across our enterprise. Thank you for your interest this morning. And now operator, can we now take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We ask you to limit to one question per person, so we can get to as many participants as possible. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nPeter Costa: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Can you clarify a couple things, you said about the cost trend, that you said, cost trend would be at the lower end of the guidance range of 5% to 6%, then you said MLR would be above the mid-point of the guidance range. I assume that the difference there is the spend on Medicare star scores, can you talk about how much you're spending on Medicare star scores in the MLR component, and what exactly the impact there is to you guys?\nStephen Hemsley: Well, I don't think we're going to get quite that granular, but I think we can respond to that as kind of in themes and maybe between Dave and Dan.\nDave Wichmann: Sure. Pete, I think you are right that the cost trend commentary around the commercial cost trend to be on the lower end of the 5.5% to 6.5% range. The MLR is expected to be about the mid-point, and you're right it's because of the impact of spending more on Medicare stars, which is substantive in the quarter as well as for the full year. I think you saw the results of some of our earlier efforts in our 2017 funding year, and what we're really focused on right now is, making sure that we continue to improve upon that, so that the 2018 funding year is at that 80% four star or higher level across the board if not higher. We also have -- as you know, we have gone our government services mix quite a bit in our business, and that is across Medicaid, Medicare as we kind of group in the insurance exchange into that as well, and those things have a tendency based upon based mix to biased that MLR up just a bit as well.\nPeter Costa: And how should we think about that going forward into 2016?\nDave Wichmann: Going forward in 2016, we continue to expect strong growth across all components of the UnitedHealthcare business as well as Optum, influencing the MLR, I think we'll see strikingly better performance on the insurance exchange business, not only because of expansion, but also because improvements in the overall MLR and operating cost structure of that program, so it's about both. I think you'll continue to see strong growth in both Medicare and Medicaid which will put some pressure on that as well, but I would expect this to continue to go nicely in those two categories as well.\nStephen Hemsley : But growth in those categories, so growth in government programs, exchanges and so forth, even middle-market tend to come at slightly lower margin, so you're seeing that blend effect in these results.\nLarry Renfro: And we'll spend more time with you on that at Investor Conference, Peter.\nPeter Costa: Great. And just, did the underpayment of this quarter's impact this quarter at all?\nStephen Hemsley: No, they do not.\nPeter Costa: Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll take the next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, maybe if I can just continue of the discussion on the ACA exchanges. Can you help us understand the elements make you confident that you're going get strikingly better? I think you said, performance on the ACA exchanges next year. I mean -- and maybe there is a good, maybe this is bad, I don't know, but you have these co-ops sailing the largest in the New York market, I assume that. You may take up a lot or you may want to take up a lot of membership from that and you have price increases. But it's unclear what the mix of membership is going to be next year with regard to health status. So can you just talk to that?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Okay, I'll let Dan and Jeff kind of comment on it, Dan.\nDan Schumacher: Sure, Matt. Good morning.\nMatthew Borsch: Good morning.\nDan Schumacher: So, with regard to the exchanges and some of the Dave's earlier comments, so in the first half year, this year, we got industry data that suggested that the underlying use of medical services in that population was high and higher than we thought, and the good news is we use that information as the foundation for our 2016 pricing. So we put in strong price increases. Average increases across the country are in the double-digits, and we also took steps to eliminate some products and reposition other products. So as we look at our exchange business for 2016, that really speaks to Dave's comments about why we expect to see very nice improvement year-over-year. As it relates to our 2015 experience and our own block of business and what we're seeing, in the first half of this year, we did not see much in the way of medical use, so we had much less used as members rolled on for the first four months of the year, and they started to connected to coverage and care and so forth, and we've seen an increase in that, and so why we're calling it out, we called it out in the context of mixed in the second quarter, in the third quarter we're calling it out more specifically because on the year we expect the individual exchange business to put pressure on the consolidated care ratio. However as Dave mentioned, we fully expect to perform within the range of the guidance we provided last December at the Investor Conference.\nMatthew Borsch: Dan, thank you. That was great. I'll get off now, I know you have a lot of people.\nDan Schumacher: Thanks, Matt.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Just a follow-up on the MA star investments. You know, talking about an overall MLR of this year is going to be above the mid-point. Every 10 basis points, as I know, $130 million, $140 million of investment on the full year, so I don't know, what that implies, but that seems like pretty big investment. So the two questions, one, are these sort of temporary in nature, are they just impacting '15, are we going to see this continue into 2016, i.e. could this be a possible tailwind for next year? And then, how do you think about the ROI? What are you measuring? Are you just measuring simply the bonus? You have the reimbursement improvements and how do we think about sort of the cost versus -- the investment versus the upside from these investments?\nLarry Renfro: Sure. So I guess somewhat globally, I'd offer that the investments are significant and we have made that clear in the past, and our goal to really get 80% or better of our overall Medicare at four stars and above. There is also benefits associated with that because when you're achieving that level you have flexibility with benefits and the reimbursements are better, so there is a -- and we're probably fund any more of the investments and we're getting the benefits at this point in time given the fact we were somewhat coming from behind if you will in terms of the overall star performance. Dan or Steve, do you want to comment further.\nDan Schumacher: Josh to your question around, do we expect levels to maintain, yes, we do. We expect to make comfortable investments forward in our stars and quality performance. And as you saw in the '17 payment data, we saw nice progress. In the year, our performance for '15 is improving which will carry forward to improvement in 2018 performance, but beyond the stars outcome, we also have outcomes in terms of quality and performance underneath that, as you look at medical cost and so forth that contribute. So those are some of things living that play in and how we look at the balance between the cost and the return.\nStephen Hemsley: And given the look back nature of this market hasn't really seen our best performance in terms stars so we really haven't gotten the benefit part of that yet, Steve.\nSteve Nelson: Okay. Josh, it's Steve Nelson. Good morning. Hey, just a little more color on the investments, so when people talk about the medical cost, you can think about things like provider incentives, annual care visits, impact of very specific programs like diabetic navigators, and in terms of diabetic programs for that population. In terms of administrative investment, it's around things like that embedded practice support. We have 2,000 clinicians that are focused on closing gaps of care locally, and then we aren't orienting our organization like call centers to facilitate closure of gaps and getting people to the right care. So these are all paying great dividends for our members. We have 1.7 million members that are in improved plans of -- it's a great progress, but as Steve and Dave have both noted, we're not done. With the progress, we're not satisfied and look to improve on that, our 2018 theme here to at least 80% of the members in the four star plans or higher.\nJosh Raskin: And just a follow-up, does that translate into above market level MA growth rates for you guys? You've been growing sort of -- let's call it in line with market this year. Should we think '16 and maybe more or so in '17 and '18 that you start growing faster than the overall MA market?\nStephen Hemsley: I think that would our hope. If you sit back and send a return on investment, I think this is a vital program. We think it has great growth potential in terms of the demographics as well as the orientation of Medicare itself to be more towards Medicare advantage, so this gives us opportunities with respect to benefits and I think it should translate to greater growth and that's why we're making those investments here.\nJosh Raskin: Alright, thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. SG&A was a bright point in the quarter came in better than consensus expectation. And now that Catamaran is closed, how should we think about run rate SG&A, I think guidance was pre-Catamaran at 17% plus or minus 30 basis points?\nLarry Renfro: Well, we are always managing our SG&A as tightly and appropriately as possible, but we're also making investments that are often embedded in SG&A investments in terms of some integration of the businesses as well as things that Dave mentioned such as Link and elements such as [indiscernible]. Do you want to start?\nDave Wichmann: Sure. Sarah, you're right that the Catamaran was probably the most significant influence on the care ratio in the quarter. We also had to increase productivity impacts on that as well, and then it's offset somewhat by the business mix as you can see from the growth from Optum as well as in our fee base programs, and there is a little bit of an insurer fee offset as well. We do expect Catamaran overall had pulled down that ratio by somewhere around 180 basis points or so in the quarter, so we would expect that kind of a trend to continue as it relates to Catamaran, but we would continue to expect some offset of that related to continued high growth in our services business over time.\nSarah James: Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities U.S.\nSheryl Skolnick: Thanks very much. And once again nice, very nice job on navigating through the various sundry challenges. One of the things that intrigued me was the commentary about the opportunity being both domestic and international. And if I read your press release correctly, it looks like your healthcare global which we don't focus on all that much has actually a nice year-over-year growth rate. So in the context of great change occurring not only U.S. in terms of payment methods and industry structure, but also overseas in Europe for example. I'm wondering, if we'd likely to see some renewed interest in that given that your [mill] experiment has now got some time under it. And your thoughts on the potential for international to be a new growth area or expanded growth area for United.\nStephen Hemsley: It's a great question and we clearly are focused on international and the opportunities to really bring principally services to [bear] there. Larry, do you want to take it?\nLarry Renfro: Hey, Sheryl. Let me start by saying, if you look to add the way that we're positioning ourselves and -- I think I mentioned this earlier the five, what I'll call future growth area as you'd find international, and you will also find that international pretty much wrap around most of the products that we offer in the state. We obviously are working in Brazil to support a mill, and we have people on the ground, and we're building the Optum presence there, and that's going extremely well. We're starting to really take a look, and I think I can talk about it somewhat at the U.K. We've been there for a while, but at this point time, we're trying to look at some of the things that we've done with Optum360, and how that is working in the States, and a lot of the challenges that are being experienced in the U.K., we seem to be setting a pretty good spot to at least assess and have conversations and try to determine you know if we fit, so it's early innings in terms of these discussions and what we're trying to do, but we do see a future there. And we think that some of the experience we had in healthcare.gov will actually apply, and so we're kind of off and running at this point in time.\nStephen Hemsley: I think it's fair to say that even the best healthcare systems are interested in using information, developing better measures to improve quality and performance in those really are a sweet spot for Optum. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James.\nMichael Baker: Yes, thanks a lot. Given that we're in unprecedented time on the M&A front, I was wondering, if you could point to any tangible benefits that you've seen so far or what you would expect to see as the process of review continues?\nStephen Hemsley: As we kind of intimated in our last teleconference with you, we really are not going to comment on the transactions of others. I would say, they're going through, I'm presenting, a regulatory review process, and so we haven't really seen any real activity in the marketplace that we could offer any commentary on.\nMichael Baker: Alright, thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And we'll next to David Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wondered if you would be willing to comment on the client reaction that you have observed or experienced since the Catamaran closure or in and around the Catamaran closure. What has been your retention rate or just kind of sense of retention there? And then secondly, also with Catamaran are you commenting or willing to comment on the reset to your long-term margin goals with the change in mix that Catamaran brings into Optum? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I think it's a pretty positive story. Do you want to start, Larry?\nLarry Renfro: Sure. Well, I thought that I'll start and then I'm going to hand it off to Mark too because he is dealing with this on a day-to-day. What I would say is, we believe that -- our message is resonating with our client. Now we do have very sophisticated knowledgeable and successful clients, and that's actually a positive, and as we have really gone out discussed our value proposition, really talking about enhanced services, talking about operational efficiency, purchasing scale as well as synchronization. I think across the board, we're really feeling pretty good and think we have started off with a solid, solid start. So Mark maybe some comments?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yeah. Thanks Larry. David, good morning. Well, we spent the last 90 days on an airplane. And as Larry and I've visited really all our largest clients as you'd expect, and that includes health plans, employers. We visited the consultant marketplace. And I have to tell you the reaction has been universally positive. I mean our clients like the scale of this combination. They like the fact that we've had a 10-year relationship and that really basically represent no conversion risk in terms of platform conversion. They especially liked the fact that we've got a very expanded service offering with the full suite of Optum services and many of them have been looking at and in fact buying those services along the way anyway, and so I like the fact that we've got a good team and the same teams in place and we continue to take care of them and obviously they are liking our value proposition, so we're feeling pretty good about client reactions. And I'd say overall my early read is things are looking good. I'll just go on to say that, the integration work is off and running, and the first 90 days have been very [crisp], we're off to a good start in bolting these businesses together.\nDavid Windley: Very good. Thank you. And does this change your margin, Larry, your margin goal long-term?\nLarry Renfro: Maybe I could offer a perspective on that. With a portfolio of margins across the expanse of our total business, and so different products and services will actually drive different margins and appropriately. So we have some businesses that are strong double-digits and we have businesses that are low single-digits and we're looking to drive and expand margin, but do it in appropriate ways -- appropriate ways meaning, we're driving value and consistency, we're driving productivity that doesn't really compromise service and so forth. So as these elements come into our total portfolio across UnitedHealth Group, they are certainly going to change the mix of that margin, but in total, we're driving towards appropriately expanding margins, and so as these elements come in they are just going to change the mix, they are not really going to influence the performance of the business.\nDavid Windley: Okay, thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next please.\nOperator: We'll go to Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAndy Schenker: Thanks. So I appreciate you on the first specifics on 2016 financial performance at the Analyst Day, but you've already mentioned several, sounds like to, tailwinds including Medicare and exchanges for next year, so maybe if you could just discuss in summary of these broad headwinds and any tailwinds for 2016. That would be helpful. Thank you.\nDave Wichmann: Sure. We look at some things that we sit back and -- when you really do the pluses and minuses of it, some of the things that are headwinds now turned to be tailwinds, and new of versions of them appears headwinds. So for example, I think, our year one market -- for our year one markets for exchanges will actually be a positive for next year, but we are moving them to 11 new markets, and so we will have to see how those markets will play out. I think our advances in stars is a positive, but as Steve indicated, we have clear aspirations, ambitions to improve our stars performance, so that we will continue to be working on that level as well.\nStephen Hemsley: I think OptumRx will have integration benefits, but they will also have integration costs, so I think those kinds of things start to play out. I think our Brazil performance is strengthening, but that markets stability is something we're watching closely. I think there will be some -- we are getting nice growth in List and Medicaid and we have some new successes there, but we are going to have to implement them and just given the total performance, we seeing rate pressures across Medicaid. So we try to take somewhat measured look as we kind of set our outlook for next year that we have a portfolio of these pluses and minuses, but in total we very much like where our business is in the growing capabilities. The deployment across the expanse of the markets tend to even out these pluses and minuses, so we're pretty optimistic about next year, and as Dave indicated, we're looking to accelerate our earnings growth rate.\nAndy Schenker: Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next.\nOperator: And we'll go to Chris Ray with Susquehanna Financial Group.\nChris Ray: Hey, good morning. Just wondering, can you give us a sense for how Catamaran impacted the quarter whether it was dilutive, accretive, neutral, and then just some specifics around the integration costs in what the intangible amortization related to the [indiscernible] in the quarter? Thanks.\nDave Wichmann: So Catamaran contributed nicely to the quarter to achieve what expectations we had for it and similarly the cost associated with initial integration activities were consistent with what our expectations were as well. Maybe I can give you specifics about how it contributed, the one thing that we did do, is we suspended our share repurchase, so that had a negative effect, and for the full year as we indicated earlier, we expect that would cost us about $0.10 a share all in, but we were able to manage to overcome that and retain -- and continue to advance our guidance as well. In terms of the increased levels of amortization, it's about somewhere around $0.20 a year, think about it in that context, and we're on a base of about a run rate of UnitedHealth Group somewhere around $0.34 a year, so combined, maybe thinking after 2016, our run rate basis around $0.54 of amortization for year.\nChris Ray: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we'll go to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Yes, thanks. Maybe following up on a little bit on that last question. Two things on the buyback upfront obviously, you'd laid out a plant with Catamaran, is there any update on that plant [indiscernible] related to next year and there is a volatility of the markets sway that in any way you think is better opportunities, so there may be a quick way to come back and buy stock more aggressively, and then just with the comment on the amortization, there will be a bigger disparity with these pending deals complete on the year reporting GAAP, EPS and everyone else reporting cash EPS, any thoughts about that and maybe changing that?\nDave Wichmann: Sure. So, Dan, maybe you want to take the first one, I'll take second.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. On the buyback front, what we'd indicated is that that would reduce the level of buybacks for about 18 months or so, and we expect to continue to maintain that reduced level through the end of next year, think about it. And our target is to get somewhere around 40% liquidity ratio, that's not hard and fast, of course, we're going to continue to pursue M&A opportunities and of course if we would need to step up our share repurchase activities because of some kind of market events or otherwise, I think we have the flexibility to do so. So there is nothing kind of hard and fast about the way in which we operate that we manage our capital structure effectively over time.\nStephen Hemsley: But we're generally on a course towards a 40% total debt to total cap rate.\nDan Schumacher: And then in terms of the kind of supplemental [indiscernible] earnings, I think will address that at the Investor Conference coming up and we'll likely begin to provide the supplemental information with respect to how we would perform on both basis. \nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great, thanks. So I don't know whether I'm just spoiled or what, but you guys mentioned how you beat number and [raise] guidance a few times earlier this year. So I was a little bit surprised that there wasn't more upside in the quarter or around the guidance? And I understand the dynamics around high exchange MLR and stars investment, but these are things that you largely would have anticipated probably at the beginning of the year in a very least, when you reported Q2 results and provided a guidance back then, so I'm just trying to figure out, if there is something that you would point to that didn't quite work out the way that you were thinking heading into Q3 report or some of that, that you're worried about into Q4? I personally keep coming back to trend because you start out with -- I know you guys provided guidance, [I assume] kind of rise back to normal, so you startup providing guidance, then you are at the lower end of the range and now you're reiterating at the lower end of the range, so does that imply that trend is in fact rising, has it gone through the year because that combined with the lack of it into your development makes me wonder if there is something underneath there. So I guess answer that specifically and if I'm embarking up the longer tree, if there is anything else you might highlight as a headwind.\nStephen Hemsley: Well, again I might respond fanatically. First of all, I think if you take a look at our year-to-date performance, it actually is a pretty solid performance, [indiscernible] top line growth and strong translation of that to bottom-line performance. I think we maintain a healthy respect for medical cost trends, and I think as we indicated before, the medical costs within our expectations. Our patient continues to be strong and robust and growing. Specialty pharma continues to be strong. We haven't really talked much about that this morning, but none of those things have gone away, so we remain respectful of medical costs, and also the fact that they have been moderate for quite some time, and I don't know if you can assume, we do not assume for pricing that they will stay that way. I think as Dan indicated, as we got into the exchanges have we were thoughtful about making sure that as we price for next year that we used kind of the broader industry experience as opposed to our own because we really had a pretty favorable experience in the first half of the year in terms of the exchanges and they have matured kind of more in line with the industry. Is that right, Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Yes. I think that's fair.\nStephen Hemsley: Because you might point to that and you know continuing to be watchful of that. We continue to make investments in -- so Medicare stars is a look back process, so really the results that you're seeing are really the results of prior periods and we have intensified our efforts to make sure that we are really going to be a market leader with respect to stars, that's what we had indicated before, so we continue to make investments there in things like that, and we're going to continue that. Things like that, we mentioned, Medicaid and Medicaid expansions, continued rate pressures there, so I think we have to be respectful of all those elements in and the strong performance we're achieving, and then I think that's why we're kind of measured with respect to keeping our outlook the same and being serious about a range when we do, but also being very optimistic about where we see our business in the fact that we expect to grow even more strongly than we did this year. So I just think it's being measured and trying to be responsible about all the elements that play into our business\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, so that makes sense. You're being conservative, you're still optimistic. I guess, one, I don't know, way to clarification. So I think last quarter, you talked about, how you thought the United's earnings might accelerate on a core basis. Is that still the message, that you're giving now? You'd mentioned a lot of puts and takes earlier on. I just wasn't sure if they all sum up to the core business is accelerating over the last changed at all?\nDave Wichmann: Yeah, we did and we basically very much said that and said that in terms as we're expecting our earnings per share and so forth to grow at a fast rate next year than this year.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.\nSean Wieland: Thank you very much. So my question is on ICD10, was it a headwind or a tailwind in the quarter for Optum? And over the past couple weeks, have you seen any changes in denial rates? And then on a go forward basis what is ICD10 doing to your business in Optum?\nStephen Hemsley: So, Bill, do you want to comment that Bill Miller.\nBill Miller: Yeah, Sean. I'll talk to you on behalf for Optum. Particularly where a lot of those services sit in terms of helping health systems, payors go through the changes with respect ICD10 particularly on and understand we're in this for a few weeks here, but already we're seeing a certain uptake in a lot of our services and a lot of our products and a lot of our content as the market is preparing and now acting in response to the changes, and so there is some seasonality in the back half of our business, and it's being enhanced. I think we can see that in the numbers in terms of the uptake of our content in the back half of the year. So overall, from a services perspective, delivering value to the clients, ICD10 has been a lift for Optum across the board.\nStephen Hemsley: Dirk, do you want to comment on the [indiscernible] question?\nDirk McMahon: Yeah, sure. You know from an operational standpoint, overall the implementation is going pretty smoothly, but what I caution is they were only 15 days into that. Having said that, we spend years, getting our systems ready, working them with the provider community to ensure success. The overwhelming majority providers in the marketplace are submitting claims consistent with the ICD10 requirements. Our claim submission rate so far consistent with expectations, and for those limited number of providers we're having difficulty. We're able to identify [them] and get after them quickly, so that they submit consistent with requirements, so far so good.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question, please.\nSean Wieland: Thank you.\nOperator: And next one would be Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Actually, just two quick ones. First, would you guys quantify where you health exchange enrolment is today?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Dan?\nDan Schumacher: 550,000 lives.\nGary Taylor: Okay. And the 11 new markets for next year, I guess we don't know what markets those are or the size. Can you give us a sense of magnitude of -- you get the same sort of share, what type of growth that might have on the 550,000?\nDan Schumacher: We're not really giving guidance out for next year until our Investor Conference, so I really wouldn't want to kind of shoot from the hip on this. We do expect -- we'll grow and we've taken some of the learning from this year as we have kind of entered those markets, but I think we're going to save guidance with respect to specifics on next year for our Investor Conference.\nGary Taylor: Okay, great. One more quick one, if I could. When we look at your statutory filings through the first half and understanding all the vagaries and nuances, we do see a very compelling trend in the commercial business, that I think ties with your comments around the commercial cost trend expecting to be lower end of that trend, but it did look like Medicare and Medicaid MLRs deteriorated somewhat in the 2Q. So I don't know if you'd be willing to offer any specific commentary on the product basis?\nStephen Hemsley: Dan, I don't know, if you can comment on it.\nDan Schumacher: I would tell you that, there are meaningful differences between our GAAP financials and our statutory financials and now how those get reported and how they flow through over time. So from my perspective, I wouldn't read through anything on statutory statements specifically.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Next will be [Ralph Jacoby with Citi].\nRalph Jacoby: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the stars spending, I guess when did that spending star, was it disproportionate and I guess to the third quarter. And your commentary about it sort of sustaining, I guess, into next year. Is it sort of the level off or could it be lower where the initial spend is higher in this quarter, having more sort of magnified impact. And then I guess, why not quantify this spend in that area to sort of help on kind of understanding more of 'core', and then similar sort of your last answer to the question, maybe even directionally, can you help us think about MLR trends by end market? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Dan, do you want to comment?\nDan Schumacher: Sure, Ralph. On the star spend, I would tell you that we have been making investments. We really started in the 2014 timeframe in the middle of that year, and then we have increased that in 2015. And I would tell you, in the relationship between the second and the third quarter as an example. So we put programs in place and what we had mentioned is that, we've seen an acceleration in the take up, so we had the programs in place, we had an expected outcome for it, and frankly we're having more people that are accepting house calls that are getting annual care business as Steve Nelson mentioned. And part of that's due to our service model, so we've been taking that interaction point and really trying to leverage it and help facilitate connecting people to care, and that's showing up, and also we have member and provider incentives and those burn into the market, we're seeing the take up rates on those increase. So we have spending in '14, we increased it in '15 and we have seen an acceleration in the take up rate as we moved from the first half into the second half of the year. In terms of the sizing maybe one way to help orient your thinking around it, as you'd looked at our consolidated medical care ratio on a year-over-year basis. There is a couple of things that contributed to that. You can obviously see the change in development as one element, stars and quality investment is another element, and mix as a third is kind of the three principal drivers. And in terms of the share in contribution to it within a reasonable range on each of those, so that gives you some sense for the kind of sizing on it. And we expect the investments to carry into 2016 and we're seeing nice progress on our performance in 2015 which will lend itself to better star outcomes for 2018 payment year. And on exchange steps your blunt commentary.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And we'll next to Ana Gupte with Leerink.\nAna Gupte: Thanks for taking my question, good morning. I was wondering what the directional trends were for the commercial [launch] ratio this quarter? I know you see utilization [indiscernible] which is great, but when you combine that with the overall pricing environment and then the balancing out with mixture of things small group exchanges and the likes?\nStephen Hemsley: Dan, Jeff?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. As you look at care ratios, Ana, in the quarter, we saw an increase in our care ratios, in our principle health benefits businesses, so our Medicare, Medicaid and commercial, and then offsetting that as we talked about kind of the full year theme in the Investor Conference. We're seeing improvement in international offsetting that sound, so directionally up.\nAna Gupte: And then going into 2016, as you say, some of the headwinds [get turned] and become tailwinds. What does this look like from a pricing perspective specifically overall? And then in the New York market, their small group definition is now being changed to only 50 and below, how does that impacted? And also finally with [indiscernible] not being fully reimbursed, [indiscernible], do you see a better pricing environment with plans that could have lost money like the blues or [lots of profit]?\nStephen Hemsley: I think it's a couple minutes to sort out that four dimensional question, but Jeff, do you want it?\nJeff Alter: Hey, Ana, it's Jeff Alter, good morning. I'll try to answer it in a sort of general term. We said last quarter, and I think we see it continuing, the market is firming a little bit on pricing. For our pricing in '16 as Steve said, we are respectful of the slow trend environment, perhaps changing. I think we took very prudent actions in the pricing that we have for our individual exchanges for '16 as Dan mentioned. We have not changed our forward pricing philosophy. We are very discipline about that, but also respectful of trending outpatient, specialty drugs, new drugs coming to market. So our pricing, I think is strong for '16. New York market, kind of your question around 2250 to 299 New York will be a 2299 market as well a couple other states. We have assumed, our thoughts for our growing growth for the rest of this year and for next year that there would be some transitional relief, so that the change last week really isn't much of the surprise to us because we're already preparing for a large part to that market to go through some transitional [relief], so our pricing in '16 is in alignment with the change in the law last week.\nAna Gupte: Alright. Thanks so much.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please. We'll take maybe two more.\nOperator: And we'll take the next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChristine Arnold: Hey there. I'd like to put the focus a little bit to Optum. You said that you were seeing some interest in innovative services by Federal Government, and this seems like a pretty big opportunity as well as in some international markets. It's always struck me that the fee-for-service Medicare program doesn't have a lot and we have care coordination and from the other things that Optum provides, might there be an interest in that in terms of the Optum capabilities, the fee-for-service Medicare population. And if not, I'm thinking about that incorrectly, how should I be thinking about that?\nStephen Hemsley: Larry, you want to comment?\nLarry Renfro: Christine, I think you're spot on in terms of what we're trying to do with the Federal Government. And as you know, we've had some involvement with CMS in previous programs and so forth with where Optum has been involved on healthcare.gov. And as we are putting our programs together, we're constantly working with them and talking about the different services, the different data analytics, and it really pretty much everything that Optum has to offer. So your suggestion is a good one, one we know about and one that we're actually working on. You know these are large RFPs as you can imagine. We're pretty much aware of how they work and when they're going to be coming down the road, but I think we're fully engaged and understand what we need to do, and we're better positioned today than we might have been in the past because of the situation that we had with healthcare.gov, we kind of stepped out of that now, and that was one of the reasons that we did it, so we would play in more of the RFPs.\nStephen Hemsley: But Medicare would be a department of the Federal Employee Benefit Plan, State Programs, and then Larry commented on kind of the international versions of all of the above. I think all those are going to the areas that are going to try to improve performance, and that Optum is perfectly positioned for that.\nChristine Arnold: And with respect to timing, should we be thinking about that as something we see in the next year or is this something that takes five years? I just don't have good sense for your workings of the government.\nDave Wichmann: I think that some of the areas that Steve just talked about, there is different timing, there is some that's deal within the next, I would six months, but some of them could go out two years, so it's a variety of situations. When the RFPs are [due], but as I would comment on it, I think I kind of said is, we have a lot of people, we don't have an organization, it's dedicated to the government business Dr. Steve said, whether it would be state or federal, and it could also include the VA and what we're doing DoD, so it's not just like a set time that I could give you, but I would say that, if we looked at our qualified pipeline in terms of how we're looking at the business that is somewhere we're staying around $20 billion and a substantial piece of that would fall in the government business.\nChristine Arnold: Great. Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: One last question please.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTom Carroll: Hey guys, good morning. So do you believe that the market and particularly large self-insured employers perhaps will give United a stronger look than usual if there is such a thing in 2016 as your large competitors are involved in some pretty sizable M&A?\nStephen Hemsley: Well, I would hope they would give us a look because of the values that we deliver and the quality and consistency of our services and the breadth of the things that we bring. And I would say also the innovative dynamic, we are well-known for being in the forefront of innovation. And we have really compelling cost structures and probably deeper into in more diverse and care management to the commentary this morning. So I would hope that they would be looking at us for those elements, and then good if they're concerned about other dynamics in the marketplace I can't comment on that, but I would hope it is for the former and so I would kind of leave it at that. I do think the marketplace will be strong and robust in the next couple years. Jeff, do you agree?\nJeff Alter: Yes, Steve. Just reminder, we already served an overwhelming majority of that marketplace and I think the value that Steve described is seen by those clients today and we hope that that reputation continues to help us grow into the marketplace that we don't currently in.\nDave Wichmann: I think we're looking at a strong national outlook for next year.\nStephen Hemsley: As we mentioned in the last call, our '16 national account season has progressed very nicely towards the end right now, and we'd see a better '16 season in '15, which was better than '14, so the momentum and trajectory is something that we're very pleased with.\nTom Carroll: Great. Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: So thank you. We are pleased to have delivered good performance year-to-date. We'll continue to improve the quality of our products and services as our last commentary. And we remain optimistic about 2016, and look forward to sharing more information with you about the future of UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare at our Investor Conference on December 1. So thank you for your attention today.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

I will be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 16, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley. You may begin, sir.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review UnitedHealth Group's second quarter results. Our second quarter and first half are once again strong across our business portfolio continuing the performance consistency and growth momentum that have been advancing since the second half of 2014. The market sees real value in a simpler, more modern and helpful consumer experience, well-informed consumer and physician engagement, access to quality care, practical innovation and fair pricing. With the expected closing of the Catamaran transaction and improved momentum in our base business, we now expect 2015 revenues to be $154 billion, earnings to be in the range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share and cash flows from operations to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion. Second quarter revenues grew 11.3% year-over-year to $36.3 billion. After tax net margins improved 10 basis points and net earnings grew 15% year-over-year to $1.64 per share. Second quarter cash flows from operations also grew 15% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and brought first half 2015 operating cash flows to $3.4 billion or 114% of net income and this compares to 97% through the midpoint of last year. Second quarter earnings were driven by both consistent, broad-based growth at UnitedHealthcare and continued strong growth and improving margin performance from Optum. We are positioned well for the second half of 2015 and continue to forecast UnitedHealth Group's earnings per share growth will accelerate in 2016. I will ask Larry Renfro to lead off today with a review of Optum and then Dave Wichmann will pick up with UnitedHealthcare and some UnitedHealth Group enterprise themes. Larry?\nLarry Renfro: Thanks, Steve. Optum is firmly on track to achieve significant growth and performance targets for both 2015 and 2016. Second quarter results were strong across the board and position us well once again for a strong finish in the second half of the year. Optum revenues grew 16% in the second quarter. Optum's overall operating margin of 6.4% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points from the first quarter, with all businesses improving their margins sequentially. This higher overall margin on a growing revenue base drove 19% growth in Optum's earnings from operations this quarter. Through the first half of the year, Optum earned 42% of its full year operating earnings target, even while absorbing $42 million in Catamaran merger costs in the first quarter. Given normal seasonality, Optum is well on track to achieve its full year plan. As we have shared before, Optum is focused on opportunities to dramatically elevate value for customers in five large growth markets, clinical care, pharmacy care services, technology solutions and government services, with international versions of these being the fifth opportunity. In pharmacy care services, there is a clear market need for a more integrated patient centered cost sensitive offering. We are committed to creating a next-generation pharmacy care services company. The addition of Catamaran accelerates our efforts significantly. Together, we believe we would better serve people through a comprehensive whole person approach that integrates data, information, analytics and clinical care insight to support care treatments and compliance rather than just filling prescriptions. This is doubly true in the coming era of specialty drugs. We will bring better and more consistent overall quality and lower costs for consumers. This approach enhances the differentiated value OptumRx offers customers beyond the benefits of our combined purchasing of over one billion scripts per year. We expect the merger to close within the next two weeks. So we will be advancing this effort over the balance of this year slightly ahead of schedule. Turning to the technology solutions market. Care providers are strongly embracing Optum360 offerings. They can leverage our technology infrastructure and full portfolio of solutions for modern, performance-based care delivery across the full range of care settings, including receiving comprehensive revenue management services and accompanying operating analytics computer-assisted coding, clinical documentation, ICD-10 compliance and population health management. These capabilities packaged as a comprehensive solution are designed to optimize the financial and service performance of the care provider customers we serve and help them transition to perform exceptionally well under performance-based and value-based delivery arrangements. Optum360 has been one of the contributors to the overall growth in OptumInsight revenues which grew 13% this past quarter and contributed to growth in contract backlog of more than 35% externally reaching a record $9.8 billion in total at June 30. And we are seeing accelerating growth potential going forward, as Optum's overall sales pipeline of potential contract awards has grown to $14 billion, an increase of about 30% year-over-year in part due to significant proposals in the Optum360 markets. OptumCare, our local care delivery business, helped drive 33% growth in Optum health revenues this quarter. We offer physicians a unique, strong and stable professional practice opportunity. We can support and equip them to do what they most clearly want, to practice medicine rather than administer a complex business. We have invested in modern technology with unique analytics and process tools to create service responsiveness for patients well beyond what standalone clinics deliver today and OptumCare offers compelling value to payers through risksharing capabilities that help them offer affordable health benefit products. The stability and growth in our patient base and payer relationships reflect the value our physicians provide. As this business matures, we expect to expand operating margins while delivering strong consistent revenue growth. This past quarter, MedExpress joined OptumCare with nearly 150 freestanding neighborhood care centers in 16 local markets. MedExpress can offer as much as 90% of the care typically delivered in a hospital emergency room at about 90% lower cost. We are committed to growing as a leading provider of ambulatory care services, recognizing this capability will be increasingly valuable to the consumer and health care system overall. We offer these few examples to help illustrate Optum's diversity and commitment to delivering remarkable value for patients and customer. In each case, these examples are part of enduring relationships we are building with people who are seeking sophisticated trusted partners to help them address both the pressures and the opportunities across the whole health system. More than selling any one product, serving these client relationships well will be critical as Optum works to achieve its ambitious goals. Now let me turn it over to Dave.\nDave Wichmann: Thank you, Larry. Starting first with UnitedHealthcare. Second quarter revenues grew a strong 10% organically to $33.1 billion, while operating margins were steady at 6.1%. The UnitedHealth Group consolidated medical care ratio improved 20 basis points year-over-year and throughout the first half medical costs were well controlled. The year-over-year decrease in the care ratio occurred despite the growth of about 1.3 million people in Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and public exchanges, all higher care ratio businesses. The 2015 commercial medical cost trend outlook continues to be biased towards the lower portion of our 5.5% to 6.5% full-year forecast and we continue to expect a full year consolidated care ratio of 80.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Steady growth and discipline around care management and operating cost drove 11% operating earnings growth at UnitedHealthcare in the quarter. The core story for UnitedHealthcare continues to be one of distinctive organic gains in overall market share and above market revenue growth, along with continued emphasis on serving local market needs. We project domestic growth of 1.4 million people in 2015, bringing us to organic growth of nearly 10 million more people served in the United States in the past six years. While this has been among the strongest organic growth periods we have experienced, we see continued growth potential going forward. We believe there are opportunities to serve substantially higher numbers of people to deliver further value and build equity with consumers and physicians in the benefits market. These opportunities stem from delivering practical innovations at fair price points and executing consistently in their local markets for the millions of people we serve. Our newest products increasingly use configured networks that improve care quality and total cost and embeds complementary services to further strengthen value to the consumer. Our combination of informatics and dedicated local market clinical staff help us find people and engage them in the healthcare system to get the care they need at the right location at the right time. Consistently getting all this right, drives consumer trust and growth follows in an expanding market of more than 300 million people in the United States alone. Let me flag a few representative examples. We are bridging the direct link between consumer engagement and lower per member cost trend and with employers' help further engaging consumers in their own health and wellness. This includes our product development efforts like Rally in cutting-edge areas like incentives, gamifications, missions and social networks. Engaging people on their own care informs them as real consumers and translates into better care, better care resource use and lower costs. In July we released the next evolution of our diabetes prevention and weight management program called Real Appeal, which merges proven science and diabetes prevention with motivational multimedia weight and lifestyle management programs to reduce the onset of diabetes, reduce obesity and improve overall health and metabolic state. Real Appeal is the first digital extension of Rally both of which use life coaches and other motivational methods to achieve superior engagement, quality outcomes and economic results. Similarly, we are using technology and data behind the scenes to advance the fundamentals of service. Our approach predicts and prioritizes the needs of inbound inquiries and connects the consumer through whatever communications channel they choose with clinical, wellness or administrative personnel based upon their predicted need making the service experience simpler, better and more complete for them and more efficient for us. We approach Medicaid in the context of the broader array of social services people need and states must address in support of better healthcare. We believe we can increase value for our state customers and our Medicaid members by helping connect people with our growing network of local market social services like transportation, housing and nutrition. On the physician side, 465,000 physicians nationwide have signed up to use our secured cloud-based workspace called Link. Link enable doctors and their office staff to transact routine business with multiple payers more efficiently than they could ever do through traditional widely used channels like portals, faxes and phones. We are furthering that offering to support practice performance, risk arrangements and referrals through the deployment of tools for search and price transparency, referrals and online scheduling and we are just getting started. Think of Link as the end-to-end dashboard for managing all critical elements of an ambulatory practice fully integrated with the physicians practice management system. Under benefit innovation, we continue to organize our networks around specific local market products expanding value-based purchasing and our medical network and next-generation patient incentives to help them get the right care and make the right decisions. This full alignment from the consumer through the care provider consistently delivers the highest value. While modern technology positions us to target and engage people, it is our local people who close the circle. We have nurses who are performing one million clinical visits annually in seniors homes, nurses and case managers in local hospitals working alongside hospital staff, community health workers assisting Medicaid recipients neighborhood-by-neighborhood and physician office staff assistance helping document physician care quality for Medicare. Each one of these professionals puts a human face on UnitedHealthcare with every interaction they have at the local level, improving the quality of health care and reducing its costs. We believe no one else delivers such a total package nationally. Looking forward, we continue to develop and more deeply integrate our capabilities. We believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at market differentiating pace profitably growing share as a direct result of the total value we are delivering and the brand equity we are building. Before Steve sums up, let me touch on a couple of items for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. During the second quarter, we raised our dividend by another 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share. We plan to return nearly $2 billion to shareholders in dividend payments over the next year. As Larry mentioned, we expect to close the Catamaran merger in July after financing of the transaction our projected debt to total capital will be around 48% in the third quarter. We are committed to sustaining our strong financial position and current debt ratings and expect to reduce debt to total capital in short order. With the deal expected to close in two weeks, we are incorporating Catamaran into our 2015 outlook. We foresee Catamaran adding around $10 billion in revenues this year, with full year 2015 UnitedHealth Group revenues now growing 18% year-over-year to approximately $154 billion and we now expect cash flows to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion in 2015. In addition, we are increasing our outlook for our earnings per share to a range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share. The improvement comes from our core operating performance with Catamaran's impact on earnings over the balance of 2015 offset by interest, amortization and integration costs. We continue to foresee strong revenue, earnings accretion and cash flows from Catamaran in 2016 and increasing level thereafter, but again, Larry described for you the real story, which is the future value creation. Steve?\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you, Dave. Larry and Dave have given you some sense for why we continue to be optimistic about our potential to deliver value throughout the broad health system and to growth. Let me just comment briefly before we summarize today's report. Certainly, we all recognize this market space has been exceptionally active this quarter and beyond that observation we do not believe it is our place to comment on market specific activities or hypothetical implications that we are not involved in. And we are not going to comment on the activities of others or speculate on subsequent processes or market dynamics no one really yet knows. Our focus remains squarely on the continued growth and expand the capability of our enterprise and how we can serve our customers more effectively. The markets we serve are changing in positive ways to call upon our competencies we have cultivated for years and accordingly these changes help prospects for years of positive growth in the continued expansion of our products and services. Our capabilities are strengthening and we are expanding into natural market adjacencies. We are intensely focused on these opportunities and committed to driving higher and more consistent performance for customers across our businesses. The key elements of our efforts going forward are familiar and fundamental. Truly focusing on serving consumers, care providers and benefit sponsors, creating and adopting simpler, more modern approaches around how healthcare is paid for, around information transparency, consumer engagement and care access and care provider support, developing valuable long-term relationships with strong partners, pricing products and services that deliver real value to the market because our design approach in underlying cost structures are market-leading, executing to serve the key future growth areas for Optum, clinical care, integrated pharmacy care, technology solutions and government services, thoughtfully moving forward at the targeted global menus, using capital to strengthen capabilities and improve and expand our growth potential and cultivating capabilities that will be important to the future more than the past. With that, we thank you and operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions at this time. [Operator Instructions]. We ask that you limit your question to one per person so that we can get as many questions as possible. And we will take our first question from David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Windley: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, acknowledging your comments about market activity, wondering if with Catamaran now near closed, what is United's appetite for further M&A activity? And maybe dovetailing that, what is your current view on provider consolidation and balance of power in local markets as it relates to negotiating your cost position? Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Well, in terms of the commentary along those lines, we have been building our business and diversifying our businesses across the landscape of our business model for several years and we can expect to continue those approaches, continue to diversify our business as we said in the natural market adjacencies, continue to deploy capital in ways that we think makes sense for us and continue to fill in market positions and to build on capabilities. So I don't think anything has really changed in that domain and I don't think there is any reason to think otherwise. Our businesses are well positioned across the expanse of benefits and across services. We are well positioned across virtually all the key markets and think that we can continue to drive very strong cost positions, have plenty of scale across all our business segments. So we are just going to continue to run our business and maintain that approach. So I don't think anything has really changed, David.\nDavid Windley: Great. Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question please\nOperator: We are going to take our next question from Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes. So just hoping you could maybe help us understand how much the impact there was on the medical cost ratio from higher acuity enrollment? I think we can probably do our own math on the growth in the MA Medicaid enrollment relative to commercial. But since you are not giving the commercial MCR anymore, I was just looking for whatever additional insight you could provide on that?\nStephen Hemsley: Again, I think because it really reflects more the reality and the diversity of our business but I don't know if we can give you something that is so precise but Dan, do you want to take a shot?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Matt. Good morning.\nMatthew Borsch: Good morning.\nDan Schumacher: So in terms of our care ratios and our performance in the quarter, they were very much in line with our expectation. And then underneath that, as Dave mentioned, we continue to drive very low trends which is why we are orienting towards the lower half of our prior guidance. Obviously, there is impacts associated with the 1.3 million lives we have added over the last 12 months in Medicare, Medicaid, as well as in exchanges which have higher relative care ratios. But maybe if you step back and look at it, we have been able to drive a 20 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a little higher pricing for reform fees, which is helping that offset by a little less development. And when you compare that to the prior year quarter, we did have revenue true-ups in there related to our government programs. So when we look at it on a consolidated basis, it's very much in keeping with our expectations and we have strong confidence in our full year outlook of 80.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points.\nMatthew Borsch: If I could just one quick follow-up on that, you mentioned the prior year development or to prior period development, I noticed you didn't breakout between inner year and prior year, or I missed it. Do you have that?\nDan Schumacher: Yes. It was all current year development.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay. Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question please\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSheryl Skolnick: Good morning. Thank you very much and a very nice job again. If we can focus on the Catamaran transaction for a moment since that is something that is going forward and new as opposed to looking backwards as I suspect you would like us to shift our focus, a couple of questions around that. First of all, the new model that you are describing and new value proposition for the OptumRx business in conjunction with Catamaran, can you elaborate a little bit, I heard what you said, Larry, and I understand that you basically trying to change the conversation away from a finite, how much more efficiently can we fill prescriptions, to something that is much more clinically focused and much more targeted at helping the ultimate payers to manage the spend and improve the health of the patient. Can you talk a little bit about why you are doing that now with Catamaran and why you couldn't do that before? That's question number one. And question number two. Can you set our minds at ease a little bit about how you are thinking about retaining and you have answered this question before, but retaining large-scale customers that Catamaran currently has in the face of the transition to ownership by competing health plan? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: I will let Larry handle the bulk of this, but I would say that OptumRx was clearly on a path to a more comprehensive and integrated approach using data and analytics and engaging in the clinical protocol before - the intensity of that has increased. The advent of specialty pharma has clearly been an element of that and allows us to actually engage it even more effectively as you know. And the only other comment I would offer is, is that we are intensely focused on serving all of our customers and serving the expectations of the Catamaran customers for sure and their expectations. There is significant value coming their way from this combination. And we think that, that is going to be compelling and we are looking to build that business not only for current customers but to expand that business as well. Larry, would you want to add to that?\nLarry Renfro: Sure. So Sheryl, I will come at it a couple of ways. Steve said this and we are laser focused on our customers right now and that's not only customers that we have at Optum, but also when we have the ability to get to the customers of Catamaran. As you know, we are limited right now as the transaction hasn't been approved, so we haven't had a lot of interaction with them yet. But I think that if I looked at the timing on this and what we are trying to do and why we did the transaction, it fits with why I think this is going to work pretty well. Number one, we needed scale and that's what we are going to have now that we have the volumes that Catamaran brings to this. So scale is going to be there. Obviously, we have been on their technology for 10 years. So this makes it an easy integration and we are going to have enhanced technology that's going to benefit both our organizations. But we get into what Steve was talking about is some distinctive capabilities whether that's the specialty drug side or that\u2019s synchronization. And if I was looking at that, on the synchronization side, we would be looking at data, modeling, analytics, the things that we do every day, tying that together with our clinical and case management programs and engaging the providers and members. So this is a profound program that we are putting in place at this point around synchronization that Tim Wicks has been working on in OptumRx, that we will now tie in together with Catamaran. And then the specialty, obviously drug side, we are focused with synchronization being part of that as well as trend management, case management as well as just the purchasing power that with the scale will bring.  I think the fourth area would be a well-rounded management team. Now we are going to have a very, very strong sales organization, as well as service organization. So that works very well and it's good timing on all this and I think everyone knows that this is a very complementary business. With catamaran, had a big focus on retail where we are on the employer side and government. They are strong in their relationships and sales. We are strong in service. Both are strong in technology. So it's just good timing right now. We believe we can move the dial a bit with the organizations together and I can comment more on this after we get this approved.\nSheryl Skolnick: Great. Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: And I would say that goes along with the broader theme of the cost of the businesses really taking a fresh looks, using information, approaching the marketplace in a more comprehensive and integrated way, engaging local resources to targeted groups so that we can improve their access to care, their use of resources and change their consumer experience as well. So it plays to us across a whole spectrum of areas in pharmaceuticals and specialty pharma is really just one of those themes. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andy Schenker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAndy Schenker: Thanks. Good morning. So I appreciate some of your earlier comments here on cost trend in MLRs versus your expectations and maybe if you could just provide any additional color on how maybe the components, their utilization and unit costs are really developing across your book and then remind us how that compares to your initial expectations and related to that one of your peer's highlights on how utilization in Medicare book, specifically anything you are seeing there versus commercial and Medicare? Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Dan, do you want to comment?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Good morning, Andy. This is Dan. I again reiterate that certainly our costs in this quarter were well within our expectation and we continue to drive a low trend, relatively speaking. And I think when you look at the combination of factors that impact it, it starts first with a benefit design that rewards consumers for better choices and then we are aligning it with provider relationships that incentivize more appropriate use of health resources. And then we overlay our medical management on that. And that starts with our people and we have got people in UnitedHealthcare and Optum across facilities, across the country as well as in neighborhoods, as Dave mentioned and in people's home and when we look at the combination of all those things, we have been able to drive a very consistent utilization trend across all our businesses within the UnitedHealthcare portfolio and again, well within our expectations. So your comments about what you seeing and others around hospital use and so forth, specifically on that, we have not seen anything outside of normal seasonal variation. So it's all in keeping with our expectation. And I think it's important to remember, as we have talked before, we have got a lot of visibility on the hospital side, who is coming in, who is there, who is leaving, how we are interacting with them, facilitating their just discharge and so forth and this is really a strength of our company and we continue to drive absolute reductions in per capita hospital usage and we been talking about that for the last six years. So again, from our perspective, very much in keeping with our expectations in the quarter, nothing that I would highlight by category or by business, frankly.\nAndy Schenker: Dan, if I could just squeeze a quick follow-up in there. You obviously highlight medical management and benefit design. Do you think United is maybe doing better than the overall market as a result of those? Or do think that they are still generally in line with the broader market on some insurance?\nDan Schumacher: I think the combination of the assets that UnitedHealthcare and Optum bring in combination to this marketplace is distinctive.\nAndy Schenker: Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Christine Arnold from Cowen. Your line is open.\nChristine Arnold: Great. Thanks for the question. Your OptumInsight backlog is up significantly. You talked a lot about Optum360. How does the composition of your business change over time? And how might the changing mix of business change earnings growth and seasonality in the future? And then as a second kind of unrelated question, is there anyway to quantify the out of period revenue you experienced a year ago, so we can think about underlying core MLRs? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Maybe I will have John start the themes and then send that down to a couple of business leads.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Christine. John Rex here. So just a few thoughts here on the backlog and how that relates to what we see going on in OptumInsight. So a few things here as we talk about the backlog. One of the things that we been noting here is that it continues to be driven by the external business, commercial business that OptumInsight has been successfully gaining. In particular, in driving those increases are, we go back to the theme of the larger, deeper and more comprehensive relationships that we been pursuing for some time. We thought making considerable investments in OptumInsight a couple of years ago and that impacted some of the progression. We spoke about that and tried to highlight that. In particular it was related to those kind of relationships. As they come on, they typically come on and we need to invest. It takes some while to mature and then they start contributing. It's a part of what you are seeing in OptumInsight this year as some of those investments we made a couple of years ago maturing, starting to starting to come online. But our aspiration is to continue to make those and continue to make those in a way that we can balance both our growth that we are looking forward as well as deliver on those commitments. So I am going to ask Bill Miller to make a few comments and give a little bit more detail in terms of exactly where that's occurring.\nBill Miller: Yes. I think John did a good job at touching on the 360. If I broaden the spectrum a little bit, I think there is three primary factors why you see this pipeline growing and certainly the backlog growing. One, I just think is a very strong focus on our markets, understanding the pressures that are boiling up there, really getting inside of the trend there. And I think we do a really good job of anticipating those trends, which cascades to the next thing as we spent a lot of time with our clients interpreting how these pressures and trends are going to have to be solved for inside of whether they are provider, payer government, life sciences, businesses and so really building with them in concert with them with their input solutions that really help solve and help them thrive in an environment that is becoming more and more performance-based. And I would say, thematically our portfolio is really shape charged for helping our clients move into more of a performance-based environment. And then finally I would say, we execute and deliver. We have great outcomes on the big large end-to-end contracts that we have undertaken but we execute every day on our software solutions, our more standalone solutions and that track record continues to strengthen and the market is recognizing it.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Wright from Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.\nBrian Wright: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify, on the higher acuities with the Medicaid and Medicare and the exchanges, I just want to make sure that the exchange MLR is within your expectations as well too.\nStephen Hemsley: I would ask Jeff or Dan, who do you want?\nDan Schumacher: I will have a take, Brian, on the exchanges. Obviously, when we talked about how we are going to approach this market in 2013 and then in 2014 and beyond, our expectation was to get more fully involved this year, which we have done. We have seen some really nice growth. But as we talked about last quarter and we talked coming in, we didn't have an expectation of any meaningful contribution on a margin standpoint. So from a care ratio, it's in keeping with expectations, but obviously higher than what our traditional commercial book would be.\nStephen Hemsley: As expected.\nDan Schumacher: As expected, yes.\nBrian Wright: Okay. So nothing out of the ordinary, nothing surprising in what you see?\nJeff Alter: Brian, it's Jeff Alter. No, nothing. As we mentioned, as we were preparing for 2015, we were very purposeful in building both product and networks that supported those price points. And as a matter of fact, we grew where we thought we would grow in the markets that we thought with the products that we thought and we were pleased we actually grew a little more than we expected. So we are pleased with where we are at exchanges and it's a growing, emerging, developing market and we are planning for that as we pace forward.\nBrian Wright: And sorry, just be a second, but the better-than-expected growth isn't coming at the cost of worse-than-expected medical cost in that bucket?\nJeff Alter: No, absolutely not. We are growing where we thought we would with the products and the network designs and economics that supported those price points.\nBrian Wright: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. I just had one little nit and then my real question. I think it was Larry who said $42 million of Catamaran merger cost in the first quarter. Is there a 2Q number you have for us?\nLarry Renfro: I think that was Dave.\nGary Taylor: Okay.\nStephen Hemsley: There is no meaningful Q2 cost. We recorded the costs associated with the Catamaran merger, the transaction cost in the first quarter.\nGary Taylor: All in the first quarter. Okay. Thank you. So the question I wanted to ask, I am sure you guys saw the CMS announcement last Friday proposing to bundle roughly 25% of Medicare hips and knees in 2016 into a bundled payment methodology. I just wondered if you can maybe talk just for a couple minutes on conceptually your experience with bundled payments on the commercial side? Are you using bundled payments in your ACOs? Or is that more risksharing agreements in capitation? And do you see this, the CMS announcement, as an opportunity to push for more bundled payments in your commercial book?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Dan, do you want to comment on that?\nDan Schumacher: You bet. Good morning, Gary. So as it relates to our value-based reimbursement in a program, we have talked historically about the continuum working from less progressive to more progressive reimbursement methods and sort of sitting in the middle of that are bundled payments. Today, we deploy them in, if you think about our $36 billion of value-based reimbursement at the end of 2014 or the $43 billion we will have at the end of 2015, we have got about 5% stake in that bundled payments category. And from our perspective, it is a good mechanism along the journey towards a more progressive population orientation around outcomes and value and quality. But at the core, it still doesn't specifically address the volume of utilization. So the number of bundles, right. So as we look at progressing, we are looking to get to more comprehensive alignment around total population cost. It is a piece of productive and positive, but it's just part of a broader solution.\nGary Taylor: Right. Okay. Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question please\nOperator: Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I wanted to dig into the two comments you made about guidance. I guess first on 2015, it sounds like all of the revenue number are from Catamaran or the revenue increases are mostly Catamaran, the earnings increase is not. So I just wondered if you could break out what is driving the increase in earnings this year versus your expectations last quarter? And then second, Stephen I think you said that you expect earnings growth to accelerate next year and I just wanted to see if that was due to Catamaran or whether you would make that same comment on a core basis, whether the core United would have grown or growth would have accelerated even without the Catamaran deal?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I will weigh into this and let Dave deal with specifics particularly around the revenue break. But we are not expecting a contribution from Catamaran at the balance of the year. Basically its earnings will be offset by integration cost, interest expense elements such as that. The improving performance is really historic core businesses and actually UnitedHealthcare has a strong period and a big contributor to that. But the beauty of our construct is that it's a broad-based portfolio and really, the vast majority of the businesses are performing very strongly and we see growing momentum. We clearly expect 2016 to be even stronger year. I think we have been basically have held that posture consistently and that would be in the core business not just Catamaran.\nKevin Fischbeck: But I guess, just no finer point on the 2015 guidance rate? Is it 50-50? Or is one business causing more of the improvement?\nStephen Hemsley: Dave?\nDave Wichmann: Most of the improvement for the guidance for the balance of the year comes from expectations out of UnitedHealthcare. And as for the revenue guidance, you are right, it increased in the quarter but predominantly related to Catamaran. That said, all the businesses improved their revenue forecasts for the balance of the year, just not enough to around up further.\nKevin Fischbeck: Are you saying United is better but you reaffirm the MLR guidance. So what's is driving the UnitedHealthcare better performance?\nDave Wichmann: UnitedHealthcare's performance is predominantly coming from growth. Very strong growth. 1.6 million people year-over-year, 1.4 million for the balance of the year. Very strong growth momentum really commencing about this time last year and actually earlier for Medicaid and for the government programs broadly.\nKevin Fischbeck: Wasn't the 1.4 million, didn't you put out the same number last year, wasn't that your -- in last quarter, wasn't that your guidance for membership this year, last quarter as well?\nDave Wichmann: I think that's right. Yes, that's the same.\nKevin Fischbeck: But you are raising guidance on better growth?\nDave Wichmann: Yes. We are raising guidance on growth and then we were raising guidance $0.10 at the bottom end of the ranges and $0.05 at the top end of the range. And we are raising that guidance based on better visibility on growth and performance in the business.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great.\nDave Wichmann: So translating the slightly stronger revenues on the core businesses and stronger earnings keep earnings efficiencies out of those businesses.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Great. Thanks.\nDave Wichmann: Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe I will ask a little more broad question about the Medicare advantage. Obviously the bids are now in for next year. You have now a chance to comment in a big forum like this about your thinking about how that will go for next year and opportunity for margin gains, enrollment that type of thing. Any broad color on that, now that the bids are in?\nStephen Hemsley: I will ask Steve Nelson comment on that. Pretty positive, but obviously at this stage we are not going to give real much precision around next year, but from a thematic point of view, Steve?\nSteve Nelson: Sure. Good morning, A.J., it's Steve Nelson. As Steve said, it is obviously too early to be specific. Don't have CMS approval on our benefit submissions yet. But at a high level, we really like how the Medicare Advantage business is positioned for 2016. We are poised to offer stable benefits and distinctive value to both new and existing customers and this is really just at a high-level a result of the work that we have done over the past couple of years to reshape our networks. We introduced premiums more broadly into our membership this year. We have introduced, developed and implemented new and unique customer service model. We call it Advocate4Me. We think it's distinctive. We have more effective clinical models and clinical capabilities in conjunction with our partnership with Optum. And when you couple that with really strong local brand, we really like our position and excited about the growth opportunities in this Medicare Advantage business for 2016.\nA.J. Rice: All right. Great. Thanks a lot.\nStephen Hemsley: So really stable across the board. We think it's strengthened the business across the board and very positive. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nPeter Costa: Hi. I am hoping you give us some specifics around your MLR this quarter, in particular on three items you have broken out or a couple that you have broken out anyways. The first being the overall mix. What was the actual impact from mix on the MLR this quarter? Second is, what was the impact from the revenue true-ups that you mentioned? And were those favorable or unfavorable true-ups? And I assume some of that relates to the risk adjuster in the New York small group market. And the last question is, your eliminations went up this quarter sequentially, usually they are more flat, except for last year when you were bringing in the PBM revenues, but they were up again this quarter sequentially and I am kind of wondering why they were up and did that have any impact on your MLR this quarter?\nStephen Hemsley: I don't think the eliminations had really any impact, but anyone try to address the other two?\nDave Wichmann: Sure. Peter, we are not going to get into the specifics of spiking out the mix impact on the revenue true-ups. Obviously, if you think about the things influencing the quarter and as you compare to the same quarter last year, on a mix basis, we would have a rising care ratio just based on greater orientation to Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and exchange enrollment. Revenue true-ups I referenced earlier, so in last year's second quarter, we recognize government-based revenue true-ups which were favorable. So as you look at the comps year-over-year, that would be something that we will be working against that comparison on a year-over-year basis. And then as you look at the second quarter this year, on the revenue side, we had expected in the commercial business to be receivers on the risk adjustment and we did a little bit better risk adjustment on the commercial business in the second quarter related to 2014. So those are the things that are all coming together, but when you step back from it we have seen a decline in our care ratio on a consolidated basis year-over-year. Our medical costs are in line with our expectations and our trends are trending towards the lower half of the guidance that we have provided previously. So as we look at the second quarter, it is very much in line with what we were thinking before we get into it and as we exit it, we have confidence of balance of the year.\nStephen Hemsley: And last year was affected by the true-ups.\nDave Wichmann: Yes. It was last year.\nPeter Costa: Okay. And then, just a follow-up. Why did the eliminations go up sequentially this quarter?\nStephen Hemsley: Dave, you want to take?\nDave Wichmann: Peter, they go up as UnitedHealthcare grows, so too does Optum because UnitedHealthcare is obviously a customer of Optum. So when you look at them, you will actually see that Optum's overall growth rate is growing at a faster rate than the eliminations, if you will, which suggests that Optum is going faster externally than they are through the internal business with UnitedHealthcare, which is the case. But they are going to continue to rise as UnitedHealthcare continues to grow at these rates.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question please.\nOperator: We take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. First, just a quick clarification and then a question. The clarification, just you guys don't talk about cash earnings, but I was curious if you could give us what your estimates for cash earnings EPS guidance would be this year? And the $0.30 that you talked about for Catamaran, I just want to make sure that's a GAAP number and I guess, maybe what would be the cash estimate? And then real question just around the national accounts business we are getting for July here, I am curious what you are seeing for 2016? Any changes in the competitive dynamics? Have you guys thought about different strategies for sales in light of what's perceived to be industry [indiscernible]?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I will have Dave do the earnings and Jeff can comment on the national business.\nDave Wichmann: Yes. So Josh, we maybe unique in this regard, but we only report numbers on a GAAP basis. So in every case they include the application of the amortization of intangibles which are pretty consistent in our business. If you look at 2015, the effects on EPS would be about $0.34 per share, if you look back to 2014, it would be the same $0.34 per share and yes, the forward view on 2016 accretion for Catamaran was a GAAP base number as well.\nJosh Raskin: And Dave, so what would the cash accretion be on Catamaran next year?\nDave Wichmann: Catamaran will carry about $0.20 of amortization per year.\nJosh Raskin: Okay. Perfect.\nStephen Hemsley: Jeff?\nJeff Alter: Good morning, Josh. It's Jeff Alter. So we had a really strong 2015 national account season and that momentum is continuing. We have been very purposeful in focusing on our customer's needs to deliver a total reduction in cost for them. So the partnership that we been able to create with our existing clients and with bringing Optum resources to the table have resonated in that market. As far as 2016 goes, right now, it's improved over where we were in 2015. We have got a couple of new strategic wins already booked. Some growth in existing clients in slices of business that we didn't have and we have retained today all our key clients that we have to bid. We will give you more clarity as the season wraps up during our next call.\nJosh Raskin: Okay. That's helpful Thank you.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\nSean Wieland: Thank you very much. What percent of your members are predominantly inside the United tent? That is, they get their medical benefits from United, their pharmacy benefits from OptumRx, they engage with Optum health services? And can you comment on what the medical cost ratio is of this subset of members versus your average?\nStephen Hemsley: We are not going to provide cost ratios with respect to that, but we will give a sense of other.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Hi, Sean. It's Dan Schumacher. Your question, assuming its oriented towards the large customers, right, because if you look into our fully insured offering down market, we have full and total pull through of all Optum care, disease management, pharmacy clinical analytics, data and so forth in managing those population. So looking up market, the UnitedHealthcare national accounts block, we have about a third of them have pharmacy through OptumRx, so two-thirds represent an opportunity for us as an enterprise. As you think about the other services, the vast majority of them have care management, disease management and other engagement routines through Optum. So the only one where we have less penetration is around pharmacy.\nStephen Hemsley: Then on the on the last piece of it, Sean, the only thing I might comment is, is that when you take a look at the across the cohort of clients and then take a look at the clients that really embrace the kind of the more maximum of the offerings that we have from both UnitedHealthcare and from Optum, those clients tend to actually have performance levels that are superior. So when a client is progressively lean towards the more modern approaches that we are offering, as Dan and Jeff have described before in terms of designs, engagements of the consumer, the clinical programs to the use of the high performing networks that are incentive-based, incentives on both ends, their performance from a cost trend point of view, from a satisfaction point of view tend to be stronger. Next question please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nAna Gupte: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So one question I had was, there is obviously angst around MLR, but you are reaffirming your guidance. Have you any thoughts or suggestions for the street around how the seasonal variation should be looked at now with exchanges, with MA, any other changes in one small group and so on?\nStephen Hemsley: I really don't think so. I really think the question really comes round mix and it is really more the mix of the membership from where the growth does come from and the higher care ratio category. I really think it's as simple as that.\nAna Gupte: And then just a follow-up on that question. On the small-group, which is becoming ACA compliant from 50 to 100, how do you see that playing out for 2016? And may be if there is early renewals we had some volatility last year, what are you seeing in the marketplace? Might that actually create more stability or would the risk pool estimation might there be any issues?\nStephen Hemsley: Jeff?\nJeff Alter: Good morning, Ana. It's Jeff Alter. What we are preparing for and expecting is very similar to what happened in the fourth quarter of 2013 when there was transitional relief in some early renewal programs for two to 50 block. We assume that will happen again this year in the 51 to 99 and we are ready for it. We are geared up with products and other offerings to serve what those clients might want to do when transitional relief for early renewal programs are offered.\nAna Gupte: Thanks for taking the questions.\nStephen Hemsley: So maybe perhaps one more question. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Tom Carroll from Stifel.\nTom Carroll: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So somewhat related to Josh's question, with all the action, if you will, in the managed care space, do you think that employee benefit consultants and brokers may give United a stronger look into 2016 than they might otherwise? And maybe conversely asking another way, are you guys perhaps being any more proactive with these sales sources and highlighting your focus relative to others into next year? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: I think I can address that. First of all, as we said, we are not going to comment on market dynamics that are driven by anything other than the prevailing market dynamics. Always looking for more value, always looking for more innovation and so forth. And I really do believe the momentum of our business has been advancing our capabilities, have been advancing and we are engaging the market as productively as we ever have been. And we are continuing to focus on that, serving customers and really responding to them and we are seeing some of that in the results in terms of retention, the response to our offerings, the broader penetration of offerings to customers. We are just going to keep on that. And I think that's the best response. We have been on it. We are going to continue to stay on it. And I think the market has been in flux and looking for value and so we are just going to stay on it. So with that, we will conclude. Thank you for your questions this morning. As always, this interaction is helpful in framing or speaking around information we offer you and we do our Investor Conference. That will be coming up again in New York City on December 1. So we would ask you to hold that date on your calendars and we will make sure that that is a substantive engagement for all of you. And to wrap up, through the first half of 2015, UnitedHealth Group. Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered an advance in momentum and strong growth in revenues, in earnings, in cash flows and the number of people and customers we serve and we expect this growth to continue and accelerate in 2016 and beyond. As I said, we remain focused on further improving service, cultivating and expanding our capabilities and market positions, introducing practical innovations and the potential to make healthcare work even better. So thank you and we will see you next quarter.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 16, 2015, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we are going to continue in our efforts to keep our formal remarks brief, allowing more time to respond to your questions. We are also going to freshen things up a little and share portion of today's formal commentary between Dave Wichmann, our President; and Larry Renfro, our Vice Chairman. I'll start out with the recap of the quarter. Net earnings in the quarter grew 33% to $1.46 per share on revenues of $35.8 billion. What is important is what lies inside these results. Higher revenue growth, more consistent performance in operating discipline, and margins strength across UnitedHealth Group's broad , strategically diversified set of businesses. Operating cash flows were $2.3 billion for the quarter, 1.6x net income. Revenue and earnings performance from UnitedHealthcare were the biggest contributors to better than expected first quarter cash flow. This quarter builds on the second half 2014 momentum we discussed with you before. We expect that momentum to continue with second quarter earnings per share growing nicely from this past quarter's results and being modestly above current consensus estimates. At this range, we see second and third quarter earnings being more even stronger in the second quarter and lighter in the third and current consensus would suggest this pattern would better fit our current business trends and outlook. We are advancing our 2015 full year outlook taking revenues to $143 billion, a $2 billion increase and a nearly 10% year-over-year growth pace. Net per share earnings advanced to a new tighter range of $6.15 to $6.30 per share, and an 11% year-over-year gain at the upper end, despite absorbing $0.10 per share and attributed to Catamaran transaction cost and the impact of reducing our level of share repurchase going forward. The increase in revenue and earnings modestly improves our outlook for cash flow from operations by $200 million on the lower end of the new range of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion. Now, I'll ask Larry to review Optum. Then ask Dave to pickup with UnitedHealthcare and some UnitedHealth Group better price items. Larry?\nLarry Renfro: Thanks Dave. Optum's revenues grew 14.7% to $12.8 billion in the quarter, with operating margins stable year-over-year at 5.8% despite more than 30 basis points of acquisition costs. Optum's earnings from operations grew 14% to $742 million in the quarter with every reporting unit producing double-digit percentage earnings growth. Catamaran acquisition costs reduced Optum's year-over-year earnings growth by seven percentage points in the quarter. Setting aside these transactions costs, Optum would have produced 21% earnings growth for the quarter. We expect Optum to post strong earnings growth in 2015 and after fully absorbing Catamaran acquisition costs, we continue to forecast operating earnings within the range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion. This will be growth of at least 50% over two years from a base of less than $2.5 billion in 2013. We continue to build our capabilities in important ways this quarter, particularly our relationships starting with Catamaran. The proposed Catamaran combination brings obvious benefits to the markets and customers we serve. It will create a competitively scaled channel-agnostic PBM focused on growing and serving all prescription market segments. It will advance the next generation\u2019s synchronized PBM where all clinical data points are connected and drug considerations are fully integrated with clinical care processes to produce better outcomes and better overall cost trends. This will be important as the age of specialty pharma emerges along with inevitable biosimilar counterparts. People will be served better, benefit and program sponsors will benefit from both the more progressive synchronized care offering as well as from sharing the meaningful savings achieved from combining these two enterprises. Integration disruption can be avoided, since the two companies already share a common technology. We believe this can quickly becomes the next generation, clinically-informed, clinically-anchored PBM. Looking forward, our Optum team is driving meaningful growth in customer pipeline for all Optum business segments. Optum's external revenue backlog grew 24% in the quarter to drive overall backlog to over $9 billion. Optum continues to develop broader relationships with more sophisticated clients who need end-to-end solutions to the complex challenges they face. For example, Optum 360 has added sizeable and distinguished new partners, most notably North Shore-LIJ Health System and the Mayo Clinic. And in the U.K., Optum International became one of the very few organizations to be accredited to serve under the NHS lead provider framework as the NHS procures an expected $1 billion of commissioning support annually. Optum labs recently added Yale University as a partner and research from the lab has now been accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the British Medical Journal. Finally this quarter, we launched an important new brand campaign for Optum to help further build understanding of our services and innovation. Now let me turn it over to Dave.\nDave Wichmann: Thank you, Larry. Turning first to UnitedHealthcare, first quarter revenues grew 11.5% to $32.6 billion, net operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 5.8% reflecting strong performances in all businesses commercial, Medicaid, Medicare, and global. Each of the first quarter care ratios improved year-over-year and were better than our plans for the quarter. The combination of strong growth across of all diversified benefits business and even more effective medical and operating cost performance produced a 35% increase in UnitedHealthcare's quarterly earnings from operations to $1.9 billion. The headline for UnitedHealthcare in the quarter is growth, growing organically to serve 1 million more people in the United States in the first quarter alone and 1.6 million more people year-over-year with notable strength this quarter in the seniors and commercial businesses. We are increasing our projections for organic growth and domestic medical benefits by about 600,000 people from our investor conference outlook to approximately 1.4 million people in 2015. The increased outlook is driven by stronger market response to our expanding commercial benefits product portfolio. In the first quarter, UnitedHealthcare's commercial business grew nicely serving 680,000 more people. Growth included 570,000 public exchange consumers well ahead of our expectations. In our earnings outlook and as we have said before, we do not expect meaningful financial contributions from these customers in 2015. On the international side, UnitedHealthcare is underwriting and pricing to create both sustainable customer value and sustainable margins and is scaling to deliver results. Amil our Brazilian Healthcare Company produced improved financial results on a better mix of business with revenues growing 12% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Medicaid membership exceeded plan even with the expected decreases in Tennessee where the state introduced a third plan into the market. UnitedHealthcare grew its Medicare businesses in the first quarter by another 380,000 people split pretty evenly between Medicare Advantage and supplemental benefits. Two weeks ago CMS issued its final Medicare Advantage rate notice for 2016, while these rates will help provide some needed stability for seniors who continue to enroll in Medicare Advantage in record numbers, the rates simply did not keep up the pace of medical cost increases. We will continue to make the case on behalf of the millions of seniors we served for sound and stable approaches to Medicare Advantage funding in the future. Before we sum up, let me run through a short punch list of non-financial highlights for the quarter for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. During the quarter we invested in brands and reputation broadly across UnitedHealth Group including the brand campaign Larry mentioned for Optum and the successful introduction of UnitedHealthcare's own fresh branding effort. Both have generated favorable responses and we will build on these throughout the year. We are getting scaled market traction on several innovation efforts, Rally our digital consumer health platform now reaches nearly 9 million Americans across the broad spectrum of employers, health plans and associations, and as improving consumer engagement we plan to expand to nearly 30 million people by this time next year including consumers in Brazil. Link, the secured cloud based workspace for care providers now reaches nearly 425,000 care providers and expect to reach 600,000 or more by this time next year. We continue to advance higher quality, lower cost care with our delivery system partners on behalf of those we serve. Medical spending under value based arrangements grew nearly 30% year-over-year to nearly $40 billion annual run rate. This was an active quarter in terms of acquisition and capital deployment, we will fund these efforts from internal resources and debt and we had maintained our credit ratings. And lastly the UnitedHealth Foundation continues to engage in a focused manner with communities in need. As example, the foundation recently announced substantial support for an innovative community care program in Maricopa County Arizona, pioneering medical education and services in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and a technology initiative in Tennessee that connects patients with care professionals through community health centers via telemedicine. And OptumRx crossed the $10 million milestone in prescription drugs donated to Community Health clinics in Kansas. Steve?\nStephen Hemsley: Thanks, David. So as we look forward I hope you sense an acceleration on a broad and disciplined set of initiatives. So as we look forward I hope you sense an acceleration on a broad and discipline set of initiatives in our consumer capabilities, brand and reputation for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum payment reform and progressive services to better support care providers, innovation and its more meaningful larger scale market deployment, strategic M&A, large, far-reaching next-generation strategic relationships, information driven research in social and philanthropic efforts aligned to the communities we serve. And all these funds and more we intend to pick up our pace with thoughtful urgency and improve performance and consistency. So as we grow we become a more effective enabler of a better healthcare system and serve more people with better outcomes to the prudent use of society\u2019s healthcare resources. And now to recap, our 2015 outlook for $143 billion in revenues accelerates our revenue growth rate to nearly 10% this year, with improvements coming from both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Our earnings outlook of $6.15 to $6.30 per share includes $0.03 per share of transaction cost this quarter from Catamaran and an additional $0.07 per share of pressure over the balance of this year principally due to repurchasing less than half of the UnitedHealth Group shares we had targeted before this combination. For 2016 we continue to project core earnings growth and that the Catamaran combination will be $0.30 per share accretive to those earnings, even while carrying $0.20 per share in amortization expenses. Savings and accretion are expected to grow further in 2017 and 2018 improving value for customers and earnings visibility for shareholders for a multi year period. Today, we continue to have strong access to capital in both the equity and debt markets. We believe we can continue to participate positively and fully as both the health benefits and health services markets continue to evolve both domestically and internationally. And we remained focused on developing and expanding our capabilities and businesses both for UnitedHealthcare and Optum as market opportunities present themselves. We expect to maintain our approach to advancing our dividend to more market based levels exactly as we have discussed this area of capital allocation with you previously, no changes are contemplated in that respect. With that, I thank you and we will now open up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Thanks, good morning. Just interested if you could give us some perspectives on what you are seeing in terms of PMPM Healthcare utilization in the quarter, which seemed with MLRs improving across the segment that it remains well controlled, but it\u2019s clear there\u2019s been some conflicting data points out there showing that there maybe has been some broader market increases to utilization, HCA pre-announcing yesterday for example with strong admission volumes. So, just interested in your perspectives on what you are seeing with utilization and how to sync across some of those different data points we're seeing?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure Scott. I think Dan Schumacher can best respond to that.\nDan Schumacher: Good morning Scott, thanks for the question. I guess I wouldn't comment specifically on PMPMs, but I would say that in the quarter we were very pleased with our medical cost performance. As we talked about at the Investor Conference, as we formulated our forward trend outlook and we thought about how we priced and positioned our benefits for 2015, we assume that we thought it made sense to assume a moderate increase in underlying utilization. And I\u2019ll tell you in the first quarter there has not been any acceleration in underlying utilization. I think we've done well as an organization through our focused medical cost management initiatives, and also I think we're seeing benefits from greater consumer responsibility as well as, as we continue to drive greater concentrations as Dave mentioned in value based reimbursements. So as we look at the balance of the year, we expect our full year commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points, and I would orient you towards the lower half of that range.\nStephen Hemsley: And I think we have pretty good visibility on that, we have daily census, so I think maybe some of things that are coming forward might have something to do with fact that 18 more million people have coverage and are using the system in a more structured way than the past, and I think that maybe a factor in what you\u2019re seeing Scott. Next question please?\nOperator: And we can take the next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Yes thanks a lot. Given the pending purchase of Catamaran, I was wondering if you could give us a better sense or more color around your approach to differentiate on specialty pharmacy management and then any willingness by the PBM consultant community to change their approach to scoring vendors given the change from pharmacy benefit management to drug benefit management?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure I think that's a great question, and I will have Larry pick it up, but particularly the strength of OptumRx\u2019s synchronization efforts to really able to connect data, target individuals, engage them particularly as specialty pharma emerges, it really is a tremendous opportunity for us to distinguish ourselves, and the cost of that category is such that it would be hard for us to believe that the customer community as well as the consultant community will not be sensitized to that category of cost. Larry?\nLarry Renfro: Hi Mike, it's Larry Renfro, and I'm going to start and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Tim Wicks, who is currently the CEO of OptumRx soon to be the President of the new OptumRx, and I will have him comment on specialty, but maybe I can start by giving you a little bit of our thought process as we put the two companies together. We really looked at I know where the value was going to be and we really had five categories, number one would be scale, number two would be enhanced technology, three would be distinctive capability such as specialty and synchronization and we\u2019ll comment on specialty as you ask. Number four would be our - we end up with a well-rounded management team from both a - what I'll call relationship sales as well as operations, customer service, and then the complementary businesses that kind of line up all together. So that\u2019s kind of how we went at this . Obviously specialty is a very, very important aspect of going forward in the future as we talked about earlier in the script. So I\u2019m going to hand this off to Tim now and he will give you some thoughts.\nTimothy Wicks: Great, thank you. Thank you, Larry. Michael first of all we welcome scoring related to drug costs as opposed to simply straight up pharmacy discount rates, and what differentiates us in the specialty pharmacy area and why we\u2019re competitive first of all relates to trend management and work that we do around trend management and it really gets to all of the levers around synchronization and what we do to integrate medical, clinical, and lab data with pharmacy data and to be able to bring that to bear to surround the consumer with all of those capabilities that help them make better decisions, help them be adherent to their drug regimen, and to be able to engage and program to help them improve their health. We also think that the approach that we take to site of care and being agnostic as to whether the specialty drug is managed in the medical benefit or the pharmacy benefit is very important and then we also take advantage of site-of-care management so that we are agnostic to that as well and we drive it to the best place of care for the consumer.\nMichael Baker: Thanks for the update.\nDave Wichmann: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi, maybe a follow-up on the Catamaran thought process, so Larry your 8% margin goal for next year, there is I think you and John have talked about there maybe some variance in how you progress towards that goal depending on the mix of business, obviously Catamaran brings in a pretty significant shift in the mix of that business. Could you talk about how that affects your thoughts and your trajectory toward that 8% margin goal?\nLarry Renfro: Sure that's good point. I\u2019m going to ask John to speak to this as well. We had this goal of 8/16 and there were some various factors or components that we needed to really make as part of that overall goal. First thing was what you are coming on is 8% by 2016. We also said that we would double 2013 earnings of $2.5 billion by 2018, we said we would have 8 to 10 large more complex relationships and that we would have double-digit top and bottom line growth through 2016. So I\u2019m going to define that as kind of core business, kind of pre-Catamaran and I would tell you that everything from a financial standpoint is in line or ahead of expectations. So we\u2019re going to continue to track our core business that way as far as the 8/16 goal that we set now. As you know the blend has changed with what we\u2019ve done in this transaction, so we\u2019re going to be handling a lot more pharmaceutical business, so that\u2019s going to change the mix and I\u2019m going to let John talk about that.\nJohn Rex: David this is John. So as Larry stated our 2015 performance to-date which show us solidly tracking to that 8/16 goal and we are very much committed to that 8/16 goal we put up as we think about our base businesses and how that configures. When we plan as an organization, we plan for organic growth and that is how we got to configure our objectives and how we point the organization. So clearly that 8/16 is very much focused on our core businesses organic growth, we are tracking to that and we are still completely committed to that. Certainly your point is well taken adding an excess of $20 billion of pharmacy care services revenue changes the mix and I would expect that to change the mix as we think about kind of a 16 and where that lands. But we as an organization are completely committed to 8/16 on the core businesses and that's where we will be tracking on the core base ex the impact of the additional pharmacy care services revenue. And then the merger will dilute that down but you will stay on track for your core commitments on the core business.\nDavid Windley: Okay great.\nLarry Renfro: So thanks for that question, next one please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. I was impressed with the guidance particularly after observing the Catamaran cost and I think it's the first time United boosted guidance early in the year since 2012, can you talk about the level of confidence you have heading into the year as it is maybe greater or there is less unknowns than the last few years that led you to in earlier guidance boost and any headwinds or tailwinds that you could light up for us that would be helpful. Thank you.\nLarry Renfro: I\u2019m so more confused, I don\u2019t think we are doing anything differently in terms of this, we - I think kind of update our outlook every quarter, we have seen enough strength and growth in the businesses across the board to improve that guidance slightly and to absorb the costs associated with Catamaran and the adjustment to our share repurchase given that transaction. So we thought that that was appropriate to include in the update and beyond that I don\u2019t think we are changing anything else along those lines. We typically if we see that consensus estimates don't necessarily line up with exactly with way we are seeing our quarter-by-quarter roll out, we typically comment on that and if again done that this quarter. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything differently this quarter along those lines. So, and if we did - if you're picking up anything we didn\u2019t intend anything behalf of what we said. So can you help me with what you think has changed.\nSarah James: I just saw the EPS increase was bigger this year than first quarter of the last few years, but maybe if you could just spike out the headwinds and tailwinds as we see them for 2015?\nStephen Hemsley: Well I think that in terms of our business I think our outlook is actually pretty positive I think that we\u2019re seeing growth across our businesses, I think we had nice momentum as we came out of 2014 and of kind of carry that into 2015. When we take a look at strength of the businesses, I think our Medicare offerings are stronger this year. And we've had I think what we expected to be in terms of first quarter growth there. The Medicaid business continues to be very strong maybe a little stronger than what we have thought in the beginning we knew we were going to lose portion of the state of tendency but our other growth kind of pulled that to virtually even strong growth in the commercial business. So we had nice growth across UnitedHealthcare and we\u2019ve had continued strong growth across Optum Amil as showing some initial signs of strengthening and recovering, they've done a nice job down there and they have really done I think an exceptional job of embracing some of the best breed of what both the organizations do. So, along those lines I think we have mostly a positives. We continue to - we had hoped for stronger MA rates and funding I think that will be a consistent thing. We continue to work on our improving our business and our business disciplines, but I do think we\u2019re making very good progress on medical cost management, operating cost. So across the Board as I go through the inventory, I think we're - I believe in a stronger place than we have been in sometime and the first quarter results pulled that through and so we\u2019ve updated an outlook and I wouldn\u2019t suggest it\u2019s anything more than that. Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAndy Schenker: Thanks, good morning. So you clearly saw a good success and exchange enrollment beyond your initial expectations. Maybe you could just discuss the factors around pricing and product design in your minds that led the enrollment success. And also maybe any early reads on those exchange lines versus your expectations. Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure it's still early, but I have Jeff Alter, maybe comment on that. Thanks.\nJeff Alter: Good morning Andy, it\u2019s Jeff Alter. As we kind took you through our plans starting back in 2013 of how we were going to view the exchanges and look at 2014 as the year of learning and build kind of quickly rapidly as the market developed, I think the results that we saw in that in our initial enrollment year of 2015, one of result of kind of that longer term strategic plan and we - as we mentioned during our Investor Conference really looked hard at how people bought what they were buying, what was successful and designs, product and networks that could create price points that were sustainable over the long-term. And I think as you look at where we got our membership, it tie very nicely to where we said we thought we would get on membership and maybe we just got slightly more in those markets. So I think it was result of long-term strategic plan around this emerging market and the results of a lot of hard work to create the product and the networks that could support price points that people were looking to buy at. So that's something that drove first quarter. I'd also say that what also drove our first quarter results were stronger performance in our key account block particularly around persistency or retaining existing clients as we went through our fourth quarter and into our first quarter. We retained more clients than we had in the past and then we've also expanded our product portfolio around some of the work that we did for exchanges, we also did stretch that into newer well priced product offerings for our small business and some of our 51 to 99 business. And we saw those results begin to emerge in the fourth quarter of 2014 and strengthen into 2015.\nStephen Hemsley: So, I think the balance performance overall and in the exchange right products in the right market is pretty much as we expected and we knew back in January that the market was responding positively so it's played out nicely. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks, good morning, I appreciate the call. Could you guys talk a little about $0.20 of guidance was sort of exclude the $0.10 of cost that you guys were absorbing, but the $0.20 of core earnings. And what the drivers are of that increase how much of that is the benefits business versus Optum and I guess within that how much of that is commercial versus government. And I guess further within that how much of that is MLR related and what you guys were seeing in both segment?\nDave Wichmann: Hi Josh, it\u2019s Dave. Thank you for your questions and it's very good one. So we\u2019ve increased our guidance by 10% on average and then we\u2019re including an additional $0.10 of cost associated with the transaction with Catamaran and then also the impacted, reduced share repurchase. I'd say the number one contributor to our performance improvement expectations here is growth and I think it shows through pretty strongly across all of the benefits businesses with the particular emphasis on the over performance in commercial. But what you probably don\u2019t see in that is you see the lived on the insurance exchange what you probably don\u2019t see is the over performance on the off exchange business, which has been very strong as well. Jeff and his team has done a very nice job there. So I kind of edge that more towards a commercial. And then in terms of other profit contributors would be our performance on MLR and we expected to improve our MLR during this year as we said forth both in both the Investor Conference as well as on the fourth quarter call. But we have clearly outperformed that this year as well. And I\u2019d say that that\u2019s due to the strength of the performance on several fronts mark clinical engagement strategies and our ability to manage medical cost the trend components that Dan, referred earlier as well with respect to our performing on impatient management overall is a I think was a key factor as well. And then you can also see in Larry\u2019s prepared remarks that Optum prepares to or expects to over perform as well absorbing the cost of the Catamaran transaction and still hitting the expected range of performance that laid out in the conference as well in the fourth quarter call. So, I think overall you\u2019re seeing a strong performance and it\u2019s coming from multiple different front supporting the 20%, the $0.20 improvement in our overall guidance.\nJosh Raskin: Is it fair to say then Dave, maybe two-thirds of the improvement is the benefits business and then the third is Optum?\nDave Wichmann: Yeah, I\u2019d say that there\u2019s some it\u2019s there plus or minus overall, but yeah I think that\u2019s fair.\nStephen Hemsley: Two-third 64 we couldn\u2019t calibrate it, but what\u2019s great is it is balanced then I think that\u2019s the strength of the kind of the diversified model, but so all the businesses are contributing to that advance. And if we continue to execute appropriately we\u2019re hoping to do better so. Next question please. \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nSheryl Skolnick: Good morning. Congratulations to everybody by my count this has been right rather an extraordinary quarter with double-digit revenue growth and strong operating income growth across all of the business units. But we\u2019ve been kind of talking about them separately with really key important factors that I\u2019d like to focus on being the retention the cost management, and that you have mentioned and you have talked about. As well as the synergies of synchronization of the business the opportunity do that on the Optum side and what I\u2019m getting at is that there was the change in the company back in November there\u2019s been change building over the last several years. Now we\u2019re seeing results I don\u2019t think that was an accident I think those things are to very clearly related issues. I\u2019m sensing you are at scale, I\u2019m sensing the business is transforming, and my question therefore is can you talk about what changed in the way you manage this business to get all of these many parts and pieces that are so strong to work together now better perhaps and also in the future and does that means that this sort of performance should be more sustainable.\nStephen Hemsley: Well, I'll start and so my colleagues can join in on this but I would kind of say dramatically that we have been endeavoring to perform at these levels and interest level of consistency for sometime. It is not just a factor of internal average efforts, I think there are market, external market factors that putting pressures to bear as well. So, we bear some of the responsibility for - if we so optimize our performance and some of it is due to kind of external market dynamics and pressures. But I think that for the last couple years, we have been endeavoring to really make the business work together on a more optimal level across the enterprise. It has been the function of trying to drive a better culture, it has been a function of trying to achieve a strong chemistry among senior managements and kind of effort where we are working together and, helping each other with both their challenges and opportunities. And I do think this is a very strong group of people who are committed to working together and to optimizing the performance that are really focused on serving customers, consumers, care providers really focused outside and making sure that we are delivering on the promise of enabling the better healthcare system and really helping people live healthy alive and get access and services to facilitate that. And I just think that has come together and it is an effort so it is not sustaining as making sure that we keep doing this. And I do think that there is a stronger chemistry among the teem today and emerging, maturing leadership group across the board and I say its board based, I would say its not three or four people, I would say its 75 or 100 people across the Board. And I think that - I think people make a difference and I think that\u2019s been part of it. I think we\u2019ve also been focused on that culture to make sure that we are collaborating effectively and focusing on serving the markets. So I think those things have played into it and we'll look around \u2013 Dirk McMahon would like to try add to this.\nDirk McMahon: So Sheryl, its Dirk, how\u2019re you doing. A good example is the advocate for me call model, that was a joint effort plus Optum and UHC with Optum handling the clinical pieces. If you look at what we are doing with our service offerings making sure our digital offerings get consistent, making sure all of our customer communications are clear and cognized and simple, those things coordinate across the enterprise \u2013 that's a good example in the case we\u2019re managing across.\nStephen Hemsley: And I think the decisions, the way we go about making decisions and how we choose leaders in the organization are really built on more focused on collaborating and being ambitious to make sure the enterprise performs for those who we serve and so I take a lot of factors that are may be intangible to have contributed to that and I think you just have seen some of the effort start to emerge and I think we can do better. So I\u2019m hoping this is the - you\u2019re seeing that the beginning of what we can do going forward but we have to keep working on it. Thanks for the question. Next please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hello everybody. I'm going to follow up with another Catamaran consolidation question. I guess the $0.30 an EPS accretion that we\u2019re looking for next year, I assume that\u2019s after as plowing back some of the opportunity for the underlying customer base, so assume that the overall opportunity from putting the two together is more than what we've reflected in the $0.30. Can you give us some flavor of what might be ploughed back to combine entities clients. And then one of the issues that\u2019s been raised and I want you just have you comment on it, is the Catamaran has a lot of health plan members or clients and I know in Optum like OptumInsight has a lot of business with other health plans, you just comment on how that relationship works, I know there seems to be some concern that people may view as competitor but how has your experience been in Optum working with other health plans?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure, well there is several in there, I might, it is premature for us to get specific about elements related to transaction that is still really subject to approval and so forth but kind of somatically I would offer that the accretion is really more a function of the transaction itself. The capital we deployed relative to the cost of that capital against the earnings stream of Catamaran as it is, we are clearly focused on driving the overwhelming majority of the benefits and synergies that arise from this back to customers, improving the value proposition, improving and progressing a PBM model that is distinctive in the marketplace. And we are really focused on the customers benefiting principally from that of which UnitedHealthcare is a customer as well but also as you point out very important customers that are other payors in the marketplace, very, very good companies and those relationships are clearly important and vital to this model going forward. And we are committed delivering on all commitments related to that and really developing and delivering a supporting capability to their PBM strategies so that we produce for them, a distinctive capability and advantage into the marketplace and to meet their specifications as they see it and become a very trusted partner in this category.  I think we are a trusted partner in this category - for a variety of payors and care providers across the spectrum in Optum and our business has continued to grow and evolve there and Larry, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that.\nLarry Renfro: Hi, A.J, it\u2019s Larry. So good point that you made and good question and we live this everyday and I will kind of reiterate almost everything Steve just said but obviously, I have spoken to quite a few of the customers but may be what you want to think back a little bit is frame what we do today.  If you look at OptumHealth and you look at OptumInsight you would plan that if we have internal and external customers that\u2019s pretty balanced between the internal and external breakdown. If you look at what\u2019s really happening with the Catamaran transaction, it will get very close to being balanced as well but some of the things that we heard as we talked to the existing clients and so forth that this is what Steve said is that, the reason we bought and entered into this combination with Catamaran was because we needed to scale.  We needed enhanced technology, we needed specialty and synchronization programs, we needed well grounded management team and as a result complementary business that same reasons that people want to do business with us, they have those same interest and that\u2019s why we believe we really marry up really, really well with this new model. Now some of the things that we\u2019re going to have to do is we\u2019re going to have to execute. We\u2019re going to have to execute day one as we get involved with new customers.  We\u2019re going to have to live up to commitments that have been made and we know that and we\u2019re pretty good at that. This going to have to be total transparency, today we do business with 300 health plans, we do business with 4,500 hospitals. So we\u2019re used to really working with a lot of people and having to have transparency and this is just going to be another aspect of it. Obviously privacy and security around information and data and we\u2019re going to have to come up with the way that we believe this is going to be pretty easy with no disruption because we are on the same technology platform and we\u2019ve been on that platform for about 10 years.  So overall we feel pretty good about this transaction but I think if you went back and you looked at what we do in OptumHealth, you would find that lot of these clients already clients of ours and they already work with us in various intervention and prevention and wellness programs. You would find the same with OptumInsight. So overall, we kind of know this model and I would say as long as we execute and as long as we execute and as long as we execute we should be fine.\nA.J. Rice: All right, great thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, may be if I can ask similar question in a little bit different way, when we think about the accretion of $0.30, my understanding is that it\u2019s versus not deploying the capital else but you\u2019ve already kind of talked about a $0.07 headwind so far this year from cutting back on share repurchase and I guess that you can do that again next year to bring leverage back down. How do you think about kind of the net accretion versus, if you had continued your previous capital deployment plan in 2016 and then I understand the concept of returning the overwhelming majority of the benefits back to the customers but usually we don\u2019t think of year one as being the high watermark from an accretion perspective, I mean where does that $0.30 number go to in year two and year three?\nStephen Hemsley: Well, first of all we\u2019re not providing that level of guidance in particularly at this early stage but we think that, this deployment of capital is compelling relative to the market opportunities. And I think the capabilities we can bring to the marketplace, so we think that this business will continue to grow, we think that will become a more effective serving customers and it will become more affected as a business and particularly in the market dynamics that we see ahead as specialty pharma continues to emerge in the marketplace whether it\u2019s going to require greater information, greater clinical engagement. So we think this is a very good use of capital that will be a important business broadly for the marketplace, serving all sectors of the markets that where prescriptions are engaged. And we expect this to grow, so we don\u2019t expect this accretion to flatten out or trend, we expect the business to actually improve year-by-year and so we would expect that contribution to grow and would grow we think much more than would be a share buyback if that\u2019s what you\u2019re using it as an example. Our orientation to deploying capital is to find growth opportunities aligned with our strategic capabilities and that is our priority in terms of deploying capital, paying dividends and share buyback is really, when we really have excess capital if you will to bear. So we are very pleased with this and we can - we\u2019ll continue to look for investment opportunities not only in this area but in our other Optum services and in our benefits businesses where we think there would may be opportunities down the road. I don\u2019t know if that gets to your Larry.\nLarry Renfro: Sure, Kevin I\u2019ll get little more granular and may be this is not were, you were going but I\u2019m can\u2019t been held responsible here for that $0.30 in 2016 and the way that I look at it, you\u2019ve got some factors that we have to pay attention to very, very carefully right now such as client retention, such as sales, such as our operating leverage, our customer service and our management. All of these things that we really have control of inside of Optum and how we manage the business and with the combination of Catamaran, who has the strong management team, who has strong experience, strong relationships, this is a very, very strong management team and so we feel confident on lot of levers that we can use and pull to go towards that $0.30. Now I\u2019m not even talking about network discounts and I\u2019m not talking about drugs \u2013 at this point of time because as we talked about some of these categories will go back to others and our clients as we work with them. So we\u2019re confident from what I call operating plan standpoint, what we have to do by 2016.\nStephen Hemsley: Thanks for the question and next question please.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChristine Arnold: Hi. At your Investor Day you indicated you expect to achieve your long-term earnings growth target of 13% to 16% in 2016 recognizing now that the 2015 EPS is going to be higher than your expected. Is that objective still on track and as you look into 2016, you mentioned that rates are keeping up with cost trends in Medicare, could you comment on your other lines of business how you see headwinds, tailwinds? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. The other lines of business I\u2019ll ask Jeff, Austin, and Steve maybe to respond in terms of our overall, we are not changing our outlook with respect to our long-term growth trends or with no intention of suggesting that. We still feel confident that in the long-term our businesses are capable of producing growth in that range and we are hopefully seeing our performance start to recover back into that range. So as it relates to the individual businesses maybe I\u2019ll start with Steve Nelson.\nSteve Nelson: Thanks Steve. Hi Christine, it\u2019s Steve Nelson. With respect to the Medicare business, it\u2019s really well positioned for 2000 now and will even increasingly improve for 2016 to serve more seniors which is really our objective provide not just better benefits but great health outcomes and a better healthcare experience. And I\u2019ll just tell you how kind of we think about that as we are in - as you know in the midst of our 2016 benefit planning period. We have now shaped our networks in a really meaningful way, we have added premiums under half of our total membership as premium which was an important transition and something that we needed to do and executed that this year making great progress on starts, we have really strong clinical programs and customer service innovations and improvement that not only as I said provide benefits but create a better healthcare experience for our members. And we have great market share and brand position, so when you couple this with the growth of the population and increased propensity to choose Medicare advantage over fee-for-service it is really strong position and very positive outlook. Jeff?\nJeff Alter: Good morning Christine, it's Jeff Alter. I think the commercial business shares very positive view of the future, we've been through a tough couple of years with lot of headwinds, lot of disruptions from the ACA which tend to - I think our ability to manage trend better than some others. And I think as we go into 2015, 2016 and beyond kind of the combined power of Optum healthcare working together to keep trends lower, keep our pricing lower. I think you should expect the growth that we\u2019ve had over the last six months or so to really be what distinguishes us going forward and that\u2019s delivering more and more value to the marketplace through different product designs but more important over the long run better management of cost and delivering that better management back through lower pricing and growth to the marketplace.\nAustin Pittman: Good morning, this is Austin. Strong momentum continues in our Medicaid business, we are very honored to continue to see strong growth, we look for that growth to continue throughout the year and into the future. Really built on very strong relationships with our state partners, strong clinical programs focused on getting better outcomes, high quality outcomes for the constituents and overall I think we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate over time and partnership with those states value. And that sustained value we think is what really continues to create that momentum moving forward.\nStephen Hemsley: So I think pretty solid across the board in terms of and the Optum business continues to be strong, the backlog pipeline and Optum continues to grow and revenue backlog continues to grow actually at a faster pace than what we\u2019re actually showing in our reported results, so pretty positive in that regard. We\u2019ll take maybe two more questions, so the next one please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nAna Gupte: Yes, thanks good morning. I was wondering on this Optum UHC better together is that strengthened or less strong if you will post to Catamaran transaction. And how would that be informed by your 2016, 2017 selling season and are there any other milestones that might inform one decision versus the other?\nStephen Hemsley: I would say just in broadly that kind of coming back to an earlier question that I think the chemistry and the operating dynamics across the businesses continue to mature and get better I think we have a very strong generation of leaders here and they\u2019re working together. In terms of this particular transaction, a lot of work done at the corporate level in terms of the actual developing and execution of a transaction of this caliber and then working with the Optum team and the OptumRx team that has been probably the orientation at this point in time. So I would say that as it relates to that transaction, I think it was our - I think we\u2019ve really good capabilities at our corporate development, organization are - treasury organization and so forth and then they take the business expertise from the Optum team really where our PBM resides. So that is probably in - that flavor was probably played out more in that. But I would tell you that the better together dynamic across our businesses has never play \u2013actually been better and as I said earlier, I think and certainly it\u2019s our intent that this is just the beginning. Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take the next question from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nSean Wieland: Thank you. Long time listener, first time caller, thanks for taking my question. So this week you said the Optum360 and Mayo is getting together. Mayo as you know is also embarking on their implementation of APAC. So that\u2019s a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Can you comment on the value proposition to Mayo given their simultaneous rollout of APAC and how you\u2019re going to manage this? And also can you tell us what the organic growth wise in the OptumHealth business. Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Well welcome Sean, and maybe Bill Miller can touch on Mayo and John perhaps your last question.\nBill Miller: Yes Sean, this is Bill, I\u2019ll answer the implementation work going on down at APAC. It's a very insightful question, because that is a lot of things going on. And it was instrumental and part of the discussion as we arrived at our relationship with Mayo, because what we'll do is working concert with them with respect to their rollout of APAC. But if they evaluated that, and they looked at our tools, the combination of our tools working with their existing systems and the systems that they\u2019re going to install, they felt like they wanted to move ahead, because they were independent and the best in the market as they saw them. And there were other things that we're going to work on collectively that I think enhance Mayo's position around patient engagement and some other things that they want to sort with from a consumer perspective, which we\u2019re going to work with them particularly in the context of revenue management. So, they\u2019re comfortable with the so called cooks in the kitchen. We\u2019ll collaborate in that context and there is not that much overlap and where there is we\u2019ve accounted forward in the project plan. So we feel very comfortable about going forward.\nJohn Rex: Yes Sean, this is John Rex. So OptumHealth did have a very good top line growth in the quarter that you noted 27% top line growth. I would say all the businesses contributing if I would have call out certain businesses in terms of where we saw particular strength that I want to note on the call and call at the OptumCare businesses. So those are the care delivery businesses certainly one of the big five drivers that we talked about extensively at the Investor Day back in December in terms of where our focus was over the next five years. Driving that growth it was really a growth in patients served in our existing markets. It was also de novo expansion new market expansion really heavily along those areas in terms of driving the vast majority of growth with OptumHealth for the quarter.\nStephen Hemsley: So to just to sum up the quarter, the story is really again about growth, growth in revenues, earnings based on more consistent performance for customers, growth in the number of people we partner with and serve across the healthcare system. And growth in the scope and diversity of our businesses. So we thank you and we\u2019ll see you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's program and we thank you for your participation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning and thank you for joining us. We plan to keep our prepared remarks brief today. Just a month and a half ago, we held our annual investor conference and fourth quarter results are very much in line with or slightly stronger than we discussed at the conference. So our focus is now well in to 2017.  We ended the year with modestly stronger than expected growth across our businesses, and as the story has been throughout the year, customer retention and expanding relationships played a central role at our member and revenue growth for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. To briefly recap 2016, revenue of a 184.8 billion grew nearly $28 billion or 18%, as earnings from operations advanced over 20% to $13.3 billion. Revenues advanced 24% to $7.3 billion and adjusted net earnings per share grew 25% to $8.05 per share for the year.  Fourth quarter 2016 results included $47.5 billion in revenues, more than $3.5 billion in earnings from operations. Net earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.11. All of these results were at or modestly ahead of the expectations set at our investor conference in late November.  Operating cash flows for the year were $9.8 billion, 1.34 times net earnings, within our range of expectation despite timing changes in several state payments. We look forward to the opportunities of 2017, as we continue to drive our agenda of quality based net promoter or NPS performance and growth.  Building on the momentum of strong NPS gains in 2016, and that being we began 2017 with one of the stronger operational starts to a new year we\u2019ve ever had. We remain fully committed to meeting or exceeding the 2017 outlook we previewed with you at our investor conference, and Dave Wichmann and Larry Renfro will discuss, we have solid growth momentum going in to 2017, so we will turn to their commentary beginning with Larry. \nLarry Renfro: Thank you Steve. Customers of both UnitedHealthcare and Optum have been responding to our focus MPS, quality and value efforts. These are the building blocks of valuable, deep, long term relationships. Customer retention was a factor in UnitedHealth Group\u2019s 2016 growth and that continues as we answer 2017.  The healthcare customers we serve turn to us to solve large complex problems. UnitedHealthcare for example, is increasingly helping states managed care for their complex, highly vulnerable and most costly populations. We also continue assist employers with effective, innovative programs to support the needs of their retirees and employees challenged by chronic health issues.  For Optum, 2016 was a distinguishing year for developing and deepening relationships across healthcare, as we deliver more value to the market place. In the first quarter, we announced a strategic relationship with Walgreens, offering more choice and greater savings to both consumers and their sponsors.  We also entered in to a technology partnership with Availity, a leading health IT provider to meaningfully improve connectivity and processing for payer, care providers and consumers. In the second quarter, several audit organizations engaged Optum to deliver pharmacy care services in 2017, in response to our progressive clinical models for whole-person care. Quest Diagnostics joined us in the third quarter in collaboration that will span several of Optum\u2019s businesses starting with Optum 360. We were honored to receive several important multi-year contracts from the Department of Veterans Affairs and we partnered with Allscripts across OptumInsight and Optum Health.  In the fourth quarter, we were pleased to announce a new relationship with CVS Health that will strengthen their retail and our pharmacy care service offerings to the benefit of consumers. Moving in to this year, last week we announced we will join the Surgical Care Affiliates or SCA. This combination will expand the breadth of care delivery capabilities at Optum, as we continue to evolve a comprehensive ambulatory care platform including primary, urgent, surgical and homecare, all designed to deliver higher value and quality healthcare to consumers and payers.  Surgeons operating in SCA centers perform nearly 1 million surgeries annually in over 200 locations across 33 states with consistently high quality consumer satisfaction and improved value.  In SCA, we will grow and build upon a leader we know well in a high growth market. A market where we have already gained meaningful market presence, experience and insight through awesome care. The momentum inside our businesses comes from the growth and depth of these relationships and the breadth of sustainable value we can offer.  In 2016, Optum revenues grew 24% to $83.6 billion, as earnings from operations grew 32% to more than $5.6 billion slightly ahead of our most recent outlook. Fourth quarter 2016, was the first anniversary of the Catamaran acquisition and we were pleased with the operating earnings growth of 18% in the quarter for Optum overall, lead by 27% growth at OptumRx. Margins reached 8.1% in the fourth quarter and were 6.7% for the full year, up 40 basis points over 2015. Looking to 2017, OptumInsight\u2019s year-end backlog grew 21% to $12.6 billion. As we stand back from Optum and look at our progress, we are advancing the quality and consistency of our services to customers, simplifying our business, strengthening our leadership team and boasting our resources and investments in the most important growth trends in healthcare.  While there is more to be done in the United States and globally, the opportunities continue to grow even faster and larger. We are optimistic about our outlook for 2017, with revenues exceeding $90 billion and earnings from operations in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion.  In 2017, at Optum and across UnitedHealth Group, we are committed to grow by developing stronger relationships, delivering consistent value to strengthen NPS and helping make health systems work better for more people.  Now let me turn it over to Dave. \nDave Wichmann: Thank you Larry. UnitedHealthcare also enters 2017 with strong momentum. Fourth quarter and full year 2016 revenues were well balanced growing by double-digit percentages in every product category. Medical cost remained well managed with commercial medical cost trend ending the year in line with expectations at approximately 6%.  2016 was one of the strongest organic growth years in our history, with more than 2 million members joining. UnitedHealthcare continues to build well diversified growth momentum as customers and consumer retention rates continue to improve broadly, with notable strength in small and mid-sized commercial groups and in Medicare.  In the full risk commercial risk business, we grew by 205,000 people in the quarter and 375,000 people for the year providing a positive starting point as we enter 2017. This growth was broad based, appropriately priced and balanced across geographic regions, products and customer types.  In the self-funded segment, the market has been stable with strengthening employment rates helping us grow within existing customers. In 2016, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve an additional 335,000 commercial fee based consumers, including 20,000 more in the fourth quarter. As expected, individual business declined in the fourth quarter, premium deficiency reserves taken earlier this year were sufficient, and we maintained an appropriate and prudent residual reserve for claims not yet received. Consistent with our commitments too early in 2016, we did not ACA compliant individual business carries any financial exposure forward in 2017.  Turning to Medicare, in 2016 we grew our medical membership organically by 625,000 people, about two-thirds through Medicare advantage. 2016 was among our best Medicare growth years, but we expect 2017 to be even stronger. Our positive Medicare advantage performance in 2016 was driven by the combination premium and benefit stability, rising stars performance and improved service and clinical performance all leading to record retention rates.  These same factors are driving 2017 growth. We expect to serve nearly one million more senior will medical benefits this year including more than three quarters of a million seniors in Medicare advantage balanced and diversified by regions, channel and products.  Moving to Medicaid, adding 100,000 people in the quarter brought our full year growth to 585,000, once again broad-based and organic from new programs in both new and existing space.  In 2017, we will introduce services in the states of Virginia and Missouri and plan to enter Colorado via the pending partnership with Rocky Mountain Health plan, further expanding the number of state partners we serve.  As we recap the year, UnitedHealthcare revenues of $148.6 billion grew 13% year-over-year, virtually all organic as it has been over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by double digit percentage in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016. Earnings from operations exceeded $7.6 billion and grew at 13% or over $900 million.  Turning to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, our fourth quarter revenues of $47.5 billion grew 9% over last year. The fourth quarter consolidated medical care ratio decreased 190 basis points to 80.8% slightly outperforming our recent investor conference outlook.  The full year care ratio of 81.2% improved 50 basis points year-over-year with core businesses overcoming both the pressures in the individual market in the first half of 2016, and the higher levels of reserve development in 2015. The full year operating cost ratio improved 30 basis points to 15.2% in line with our investor conference forecast.  As we step in to 2017, there are a number positive indications that reflect our continuing momentum. Our focus on quality and NPS\u2019s intensifying and bearing results. Consumers continue to engage more deeply in their health earning $255 million in healthy behavioral incentives in 2016.  We began the year crisply in customer installation and service on record levels of new and diversified growth across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum enters the year with record backlog, people served and adjusted scripts. And with Optum bank crossing the $7 billion mark in consumer health assets under management, Optum in pursuing a strong vision as a health service organization unlike any in existence today.  We will continue to develop our business to fit that vision in 2017. Our merger with SCA will significantly expand our capabilities for consumers, payers and hospital partners that often care, while establishing presence in new markets.  UnitedHealthcare enter the year with strong retention rates and new business growth across all three lines of business, and we are seeing improving performance and earnings contribution from our hospital company and health plan in Brazil.  We should touch briefly on Penn Treaty an industry topic we first discussed in 2010 that finally seems to be resolving. Penn Treaty is a financially distressed long term care insurance company with no affiliation to us. While we have never sold long term care policies, under state laws health insurers will be assessed a share of the guarantee funds needed to protect Penn Treaties policy holders.  We expect to accrue an approximately $315 million operating charge for our portion of the assessment. This charge will be funded over several years and the cash will be largely recovered through premium tax credits overtime.  While this outcome is well known, current accounting practice only allows this charge to be recognized when a final court order of liquidation is entered. When that ultimately occurs we will incorporate the impact in GAAP earnings, while excluding it from adjusted earnings per share.  To wrap, we remain committed to our outlook for 2017 revenues of $197 billion to $199 billion adjusted net earnings of $9.30 to $9.60 per share and cash flows from operations of $11.5 billion to $12 billion. Only 17 days in to the year, we think this posture strikes an appropriate balance of optimism and prudence. Steve?\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you Dave. You may notice a separate press release this morning announcing that Tim Flynn has joined the Board of UnitedHealth Group. Tim is an exceptionally creative and solutions oriented executive, a former global managing partner of KPMG. Tim has deep financial and global operating expertise, he is also deeply versed in corporate governance, and we are thrilled to welcome Tim to our Board of Directors.  We\u2019ll close with a few words on the overall domestic healthcare landscape. To be clear, we have no better sense than anyone else concerning the timing or any ultimate actions with respect to the Affordable Care Act. So any questions and responses on that subject need to have that clear context. And as you would anticipate, we will not speculate on hypothetical or provocative questions in this area this morning.  Our posture has remained consistent for some time now. We remain positive and constructive with respect to what ultimately evolves in the next phase of healthcare change. We see the opportunity for robust, state based healthcare markets offering flexible commercial benefits, flexible Medicaid available to eligible as well as pain beneficiaries, well-structured and managed high risk pools, exchanges where space choose to sustain them and much more.  We believe all of these taken together can represent affective, local, state based coverage systems which can well accommodate those currently in the ACA individual exchanges, as well as serve as channels for further expanding coverage if that remains the focus.  We see this approach as being simpler, offering more flexibility, more choice and more affordability to both consumers and state and federal sponsors. And as we have for many years, we remain staunch advocates for affordable coverage infrastructure that supports a modern healthcare system including a strong and diversified future oriented healthcare work force and improvements to government sponsored benefits that incorporate better use of technology, information and care resources for Americans.  UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare remain full committed to our mission, to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Today we see more opportunities to serve and grow in the next 10 years than the past 10. We will remain and adaptable, innovative and restless enterprise. We see many ways we can work, our work can continue to improve, if we stay focused on that mission, and we are committed to pursue that goal in 2017 and a decade ahead.  We thank you for your interest today and now we\u2019ll take questions. Again one at a time please, and we\u2019ll try to respond as many as we can today. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] our first question is coming from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Borsch: I just was hoping that you could address the question to the Pennsylvania Medicaid contracts, and how the latest developed in the re-bid might or might not have affected your guidance relative to what you had already baked in for those contracts. \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I\u2019ll have Austin do that, but those will that affect our guidance at all after \u201917. Austin?\nAustin Pittman: Sure. First let me say that our commitment has been and still is to focus on the service of the people in Pennsylvania. That\u2019s what we get up and do every single day, so we\u2019re staying very focused there. As per the Medicaid program or health choices, as you know, we currently serve about 220,000 Pennsylvanians. The procurement process as has been noted has been particularly troubling to us both the lack of transparency and the material shifts and the outcome itself.  If you recall, we went from retaining our existing footprint and expanding state-wide in the initial ward to being eliminated from the program through this latest protest and rebid process. So we have formerly protest as others have. We\u2019re pursuing all of our available options to get transparency. As we get acquainted with the details, we\u2019ll take further action from there. In the meantime, as I said at the start we\u2019ll stay focused on serving the people of Pennsylvania. \nMatthew Borsch: Just on the guidance, I thought that Medicaid enrollment ads for this year included maybe a material number for Pennsylvania, was that wrong about that?\nStephen Hemsley: No I just think that this process will take some time. I think the protest will extend and I think we also have other opportunities throughout the course of the year. So I don\u2019t think that single state like that will affect our outlook. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nDavid Windley: Acknowledging that your intent in OptumCare is to be multi-payer, I wondered if you could comment on how much of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s medical cost is flowing through OptumCare, what your goals for that might be and then how Surgical Care affiliates falls in to that or leverage that opportunity thanks? \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I think we\u2019ll have a Larry kind of comment on that. I guess I would focus on the fact that we serve multiple payers through our OptumCare platform have for some time that portfolio continues to expand SCA fits right in to it. \nLarry Renfro: Sure. Dave, I\u2019m going to go back a little bit and talk about how we kind of got where we are at with OptumCare, where we are in terms of SCA at this point in time. So if you go back in time five years ago, we had this one Optum plan that we put together and as part of that structure we had a 75 market strategy.  Now all this relates to UHC and how we have positioned Optum from the start. So with a 75 market strategy we\u2019ve kind of looked at the market place at a $500 billion market place that now has grown to $1 trillion. And as part of that, we have looked at what the growth pillars are going to be in the future and OptumCare is the piece of that, and that\u2019s where SCA will fit. And as SCA is a great organization that we are bringing in that\u2019s going to add scope and scale, it\u2019s going to be very complementary to what we\u2019re doing. So we feel pretty strong about SCA. We feel pretty strong about OptumCare being a big piece of our strategy going forward in the future to get to the breadth of the market that we\u2019re trying to penetrate.  I might ask Dan Schumacher to comment a bit about the UHC side. Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thank you Larry. As we look at surgeries broadly, obviously the deal to winning a majority of those still take place in hospital setting both inpatient and outpatient and so the reality is that there is a huge opportunity for greater penetration for surgery to take place in an ambulatory setting. And when you look at the kind of quality that can be demonstrated through and ambulatory setting as well as the patient satisfaction that frankly runs north of 90 when you look at the net promoter scores and you see a cost profit that runs about half of what you\u2019d expect in an hospital setting, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity.  And within UnitedHealthcare for some time we\u2019ve been focused on sight of service for several years and we\u2019ve made some headway, but the reality is, we think there\u2019s an opportunity to really accelerate and we think the partnership with SCA provides a great potential. \nStephen Hemsley: And if I\u2019m not speaking enough Dave Wichmann will correct me on this. A little less than half or roughly half of the flow that goes, the activity flow that goes through OptumCare is UnitedHealthcare and only 12% of SCA is UnitedHealthcare, is that true?\nDave Wichmann: That\u2019s right Steve. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jane Farr with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. \nJane Farr: United saw a strong Medicare growth in January. The penetration for the overall market went up more than I've ever seen in January versus December jobs. So, can you talk to your view of underlying long-term growth for Medicare Advantage, either for United specifically or the industry, and your view on where MA penetration could go now that we have the younger population aging in? If you have any numbers around how much of your (inaudible) growth was from fee for service that would be helpful as well?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I think Steve Nelson can handle this. \nSteve Nelson: Sure. This is Steve Nelson. We will talk a little about our growth not speculating on the broader industry, but we did see higher this year as you noted and so the program continues to be really popular and very effective.  Just commenting on our growth, I\u2019d reiterate what Dave said in his prepared comment. The growth that we see coming out of AEP is very strong and in line with the guidance that we\u2019ve provided in our November investor conference. And one sort of an important point there is, about 85% of our full year guidance actually comes to us on January, so the bulk of that membership is already with us.  We have some pretty good insight in to the mix as well, and as you can - as we\u2019ve talked about before about half of that was from our group business so we\u2019ve a lot of insight in to that membership and in fact a lot of times we have claims experience there. And then we also had broad growth all of our geographies, markets and products. So really the product stability, the product portfolio, the offers choice is really resonating in the market. There are several drivers that I would attribute to at least our growth as we are experiencing this strong growth for 2017. Again the product portfolio that we\u2019ve worked hard over the past several years to put this in place. Also really strong engagement and with our distribution partnership across all of our channels really brand in the market for UnitedHealthcare and then also the investments and the improvements we\u2019ve made in as Dave noted in our stars quality and also in our member experience.  So I think this really positions us well to receive this growth and to continue to grow not only in 2017, but beyond. In terms of the conversions, it\u2019s a little early to get in to specific details about the conversions from fee for service, but again there was some market share growth and Medicare wedge overall, and I think it\u2019s a testament to the effectiveness of the program where you see higher outcomes, lower costs and very high satisfaction. \nStephen Hemsley: Thanks Steve. And despite the fact that MA has been underfunded over the last several years, it continues to take share with or take 1.3% or 1.5% market share shit is the indication. That\u2019s been pretty steady despite the fact that it\u2019s been underfunded. It is clearly the most popular form of Medicare; it serves the lower income groups. It has great retention value, and we would think that that will continue so that the share of Medicare Advantage will ultimately continue to grow and take its place in terms of the government programs. Next question please. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Justine Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nSteve Baxter: This is Steve Baxter on for Justin. A question for you about the OptumInsight backlog. Appreciating that the backlog here is at a record level, but we noticed that it was flat sequentially for the first time since 2013 heading into the ACA implementation. I was hoping you could speak to what you're hearing from clients, and in particular, are you seeing any uncertainty with hospital buying patterns just given the uncertainty of where we might be going with (inaudible) and replace?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Larry you want to take it or Bill Miller. \nLarry Renfro: I will start and then I will hand it to Bill. I think that if you look at fourth quarter you\u2019ll see that we had a pretty strong fourth quarter specially OptumInsight and Bill will speak to that in a second. So all of our financials were in line with our expectations.  One thing to keep in mind, when it comes to technology services and how we look at Optum360 across the board is that we are very diversified. When we really serve is 300 health plans, 4500 hospitals, over a couple of hundred government agencies and so forth. So we have a lot of opportunity and its diversified opportunity. So Bill just comment on the quarter.\nBill Miller: We\u2019re real happy with our performance in Q4 and a part of that confidence in going forward and with respect to the pipeline and the backlog is, there\u2019s several metrics that we look at and while hospital is one sector that we work with, you understand that we have a really wide constituencies of payer provider life sciences companies and government and across the board we\u2019re seeing enormous growth in our pipeline. Our sales and some of the size of the sale in each of those geographies have clients has grown dramatically year-over-year.  And if I look at and search for slow-downs, we don\u2019t see it because if you look at the solutions that we provide, they are mission-critical, they are implementing marked technology, they have proven ROI. So we\u2019re not seeing the slow-down that perhaps is being felt in other places because of our diversity, the mission critical nature of our solutions that we bring to market. And so we are seeing wide adoption. And with respect to the backlog, while they may have been a little flat in this quarter-over-quarter, if you look at the year-over-year growth it\u2019s a tremendous story. If you look at any given quarter, we\u2019re going to burn through some backlog, there\u2019s projects that get completed and so that doesn\u2019t concern us.  I think we look at the year-over-year metric and feel really positive and heading in to \u201917, if you look at how much time we spent in the market, the way we\u2019ve developed our products and the interviews that we do with clients and the expansion of all of our key clients, it sets us up for another really successful year, despite of the fact that there is some uncertainty about ACA and others. That uncertainty always creates opportunities for Optum because clients are looking for ways to thrive and survive in these uncertain times and Optum becomes a really relative and significant client and partner to talk to in those context. \nStephen Hemsley: Yeah, I couldn\u2019t agree with that more. Next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. \nPeter Costa: Can you give us some more specifics on a couple of (inaudible) in the quarter, in particular the unfavorable development in the fourth quarter and the higher interest and other income in the quarter?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure, we\u2019ll split those out, maybe Dan the development and John Rex, the investment income. \nDan Schumacher: Sure. Good morning Peter. Dan Schumacher. Let me offer a couple of comments about medical overall and more specifically to your question around development. Now as you look at our consolidated medical care ratio for the quarter, it was a little bit than what we had discussed at the end of November and then inside that I\u2019d tell you that our medical cost continued to be well controlled.  And the other thing, as you look at development sort of quarter in and quarter out, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that it\u2019s on a base of medical spend on an annual basis of more than a $115 billion. So when you look at the outcomes this quarter in particular, it isn\u2019t particularly meaningful.  Looking specifically at this quarter, I\u2019d tell you that if you look across it both from a geography perspective look across categories I don\u2019t think that there is anything that is worth highlighting. I would tell you that it probably orients a little bit more towards our government businesses, and underneath that we\u2019ve talked overtime about some of the efforts we\u2019ve had around incentives related to quality and the underlying use that comes with that and we\u2019ve seen some of that this quarter and that\u2019s showing up in those outcomes. But importantly and overall I\u2019d tell you that our medical base line is for our all of our businesses, we are tracking in line with our expectations as we close the year and that means that we are starting 2017 where we had planned. \nJohn Rex: Peter, this is John Rex on investment income. Really two major elements driving most of that put in the category just larger balances outstanding due to the growth we\u2019re seeing at UHC and Optum Bank. So those are large interest earning balances across those books. In addition higher realized capital gains for our investment portfolio.  So, we did some pro-active portfolio of re-alignment ahead of the fed interest rate actions to capture some of that value and compare to our reinvested higher rates going forward as those occurred and so we wanted to be proactive as we are anticipating those events. Let\u2019s say, if I take both those elements rather balanced in terms of the higher investment income that you\u2019re seeing in the quarter. \nStephen Hemsley: Next question please. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nScott Fidel: Steve wanted to ask a thematic question here, just as we enter into the whole discussion around corporate tax reform, and just thinking about the minimum medical loss ratios in that context. Clearly it hasn't seemed like the (inaudible) LMRs have proven to be that big of a deal the last couple of years, but just now as we think about corporate tax reform and then leveraging the benefits of that, do you think it might make sense for the industry to perhaps get more proactive on rethinking the minimum LMRs and maybe lobbying to have some relief there, or basically the question is do you think that minimum LMRs could end up offsetting a lot of the benefits to shareholders from corporate tax reform or not? \nStephen Hemsley: So again Scott we\u2019re not really engage in commentary around policy or what could or couldn\u2019t happen. The only comment I\u2019d make about MLRs and why they were probably not as controversial is because for the most part our offerings were pretty close to those MLR levels anyway. So they\u2019re pretty much across the board. So that\u2019s why I think that they were managed and digest across the industry. And beyond that, we\u2019re just not going to comment on what tax policy could be or what might come forward in terms of changes in the ACA.  Our commentary with the market place has really been more broadly about what could be simpler, more sustainable, local market based coverage approaches. So that\u2019s kind of where our level of commentary has been. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead. \nRalph Jacoby: Just want to go back to the SCAI deal; obviously it looks like a platform deal in what's a fragmented market. So one, just wanted to make sure I understand the strategy, is it to sort of accelerate the M&A pace or is it a little bit more of a test model, if you will for now? And then how will you navigate, and maybe have you had conversations with all of the various partnerships and JVs, some of which are obviously with other payers as well as hospital systems that could create some friction?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. Larry will comment on this, but we think this step is an important development step. So we think this is a market leading platform we can build on, so we do think it\u2019s important that it fits nicely in to the whole narrative of more comprehensive, local market base, ambulatory care platform. So that\u2019s the high level thinking behind it. Larry you want to pick it up?\nLarry Renfro: Sure, and I\u2019m going to ask Tami to talk about the footprint so that you get a feel for the footprint and how everything is going to work together inside Optum in regard to SCA and why it\u2019s a primary focus for us. And then I\u2019m going to ask Amir Rubin really to talk about what\u2019s been going on in the diligence side of this and what the business looks like.  I will caution you that we are in an approval process. So during this approval process there\u2019re certain things obviously that we can\u2019t do, but I think I can lay out the strategy and these folks will be able to pack it up. I probably didn\u2019t do a good job a few minutes ago of explaining it, but this goes back five years. This is a strategy that we put in place to really go after what I would call the OptumCare business as one of our primary pillar for growth.  We started with primary care and I think you know that we\u2019ve been growing primary care over the last few years. We\u2019re probably around 21,000 physicians at this point. The second part of OptumCare was our urgent care with Med Express and other centers that we have set up with urgent care. So we\u2019re up to 250 centers there. So obviously the surgery center kind of starts to play out and add capabilities for us as we go forward.  So this is all about growth, and this is about us maintaining our physician with the ambulatory side to really make this move forward, not only here but also globally. Because as we look and I\u2019m going to stray here but just for a second, but I would tell you that the work that we are doing in Brazil, the work that we\u2019re doing in London, what we\u2019re expecting to do across Europe and so forth. This is all a process that would fit nicely in all of those markets. So let me turn it over to Tami to kind of go through the footprint. \nTami Reller: Thanks Larry, and maybe just a couple of OptumCare broader perspectives and numbers to give this context before Amir talks specifically about SCA. If you look at OptumCare today, it already represents more than 50% of OptumHealth revenues. And obviously this is an important growth platform, so we expect more in the future. Also if you look at OptumCare, today we have a footprint in 28 primary care markets that expect to expand in to four to six new markets per years.  And so as we look at the opportunity between OptumCare broadly and SCA which today has 200 locations in 33 states which we noted earlier, there is an opportunity there to really look at that much more holistically and make some good growth come from that.  Larry also noted the more 21,000 physicians today and we would expect to continue to grow that as a nice clip in to the future as well OptumCare probably 2,000 per year as we move forward. So a tremendous amount of growth ahead across the OptumCare platform. \nAmir Rubin: This is Amir Rubin, just to add to Larry and Tami\u2019s comments. We did a detailed due diligence process and we were very, very impressed with the exceptional SCA leadership and the model that SCA has developed across the country. As you heard from Steve\u2019s opening remarks, SCA has over 200 centers in 33 states and these are terrific centers with outstanding quality accredited and certified by the highest accreditation bodies NPS scores, Net Promoter Scores of 90 on average, really high net promoter scores delivering outstanding surgical procedures that have the cost of inpatient settings in partnership with surgeons, in partnership with health systems, many of whom are our clients and serving communities very effectively.  As you heard from Tami, we\u2019re excited too. There\u2019s a nice overlap, probably about 50% overlap with the SCA market and the OptumCare market, and moreover SCA and its surgeons and the health systems that it partners with, are now looking to move even more complex cases in to the ambulatory arena such as joint replacements, hips and knees and really on the front end of delivering high quality, high service and value based care, serving all care, UnitedHealthcare, as you\u2019ve heard from Dan Schumacher and across OptumCare we serve over 85 cares that we are very excited to continue serving the broad payer market partnering with our health system clients and aligning with physician for the community. \nLarry Renfro: This is Larry again. Let me just make one comment. So if you looked at our 75 market strategy that we\u2019ve been executing against today, we are in 28 markets. With this acquisition, we will pick up about 17 more markets. So about 50% of SCA markets overlap with 17 new markets. So this is going to accelerate our growth obviously, and this is a very, very key point in the growth of OptumCare.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nJosh Raskin: Wanted to follow up, I understand Steve you don't want to speculate on potential regulatory changes etcetera, so without getting into any details on what you're expecting. One, have you spoken with the incoming President-elect or his team, and then are there any changes that you\u2019ve made strategically already? So forgetting about what can happen in the world, but is there anything you're doing in the markets today that would relate to some things that you think could potentially happen?\nStephen Hemsley: Josh, I would have preferred to answer the last one compared to this one. We\u2019ve maintained an presence broadly in the healthcare sector, again policy sector, and have been consistent for some time, and I think you\u2019ve seen our materials with respect to really advancing a simpler state-based healthcare system around investments going forward in to the healthcare sector around affordability and good sustainable ways to advance affordability.  Systematically very much involved and we have been offering specific ideas with respect to that. It aligns with the businesses that we\u2019ve had in the philosophy and the mission of our enterprise about helping people live healthier lives and about making the system work better for everyone, everyone being all the participants in the healthcare market place.  It has been more at a, what I would call, a high level and then invoked more specifically when called upon. We think that\u2019s a sustainable way, we have been on this for some time, prior to the outcome of any elections etcetera. So we would have been indifferent in terms of who would have proceeded that these would be the kinds of themes that we think will drive a better and higher performing healthcare systems that could serve more Americans.  And we continued to be on that track and I think the setup of that business as we\u2019ve said many times, the participation across the expanse of the benefit market and the continued diversification in the important markets with Optum, serving areas that where we think we can bring our competencies around, expertise around information and insights about how healthcare could be organized and resources used more affectively and the virtuous application of technology to drive a more modern healthcare system. Those are things that are really native to our businesses at this point in time, very adaptable, so adaptability is a very important thing for us.  We can move these things around to approach the market place in different ways, and we think we have been developing the kind of assets and capabilities to serve a healthcare system and combinate a variety of approaches. So that has kind of philosophy and that has been our narrative with the policy community and expert community and will continue to stay in a positive constructive posture in that way because I think it\u2019s - this as we\u2019ve said many times will continue to evolve both as a market place and in terms of national policy.  So I don\u2019t know what I could tell you more than that, that\u2019s kind of the philosophy we bring to it and it\u2019s the same philosophy that we speak in Washington and in state capitals, and I think it has and I think it will continue to serve us well and I think be positive to the healthcare market place. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nMichael Baker: I was wondering if you could comment or give an early read on the PBM selling season in terms of potential for activity versus what we saw for the last selling season.\nStephen Hemsley: Mark you want to comment?\nMark Thierer: It\u2019s busy, it\u2019s busy. This last year we really felt good about the big wins that we posted. It was the largest selling season obviously in our history. But at this point in the selling season we\u2019re queuing up for lots of new employers and health plans are coming to market as well. So I would say right now our pipeline is larger than it\u2019s ever been. And I will just take a moment and tell you, in this business you have to start your new business well, because the market checks and - it\u2019s a small business and we\u2019ve just had our best one won I think in the history of the business our readiness and our preparation for some very large scale clients was I think superior and we are gauging this by how our clients are reacting and the NPS scores that we\u2019re seeing. So this successful won one on last year\u2019s selling season sets us up very well for the 2017 selling season. As I said the pipeline is robust. We are pushing our new value prop and we do think that the synchronization message is totally resonating and clients are migrating towards it. So we are feeling pretty good about our opportunity in 2017. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from AJ Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. \nA.J. Rice: I might just ask a two-part question on the international business. I think the comments were made in the prepared remarks that you're pleased with the progress you've made down there and I noticed that fourth quarter you had good enrollment in Brazil. You have to go back to fourth quarter of last year for a positive sequential enrollment as well, I don't know if there's something seasonality that drives that or some other dynamic that's going on.  But can you just give us an update on where things stand there, and where you are at relative to contribution margins. And the other aspect on international I was just going to ask you about is I think you guys have commented that there are some contracts that Optum is looking at, particularly in the UK, potentially. Can you give us any update on the timing of when we might see those?\nDave Wichmann: A.J. it\u2019s Dave. I think I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then ask Larry to comment on the Optum contracts in particular. A.J. I wish I could say that was organic growth down in Brazil, but it was actually a small acquisition that we completed of both a health insurance company and a healthcare company. So it\u2019s an integrated delivery system that serves the ABC region near Sao Paolo. It\u2019s named Santa Elaina and it is a very strong, well performing local delivery system there that really serves the lower end of the middle class broadly.  So it added about 250,000 lives or so to our quarter. Maybe I\u2019m not really sure how to respond to the contribution margin comment, but I will say that we do see an improved outlook for Amil and now what is called Americas (inaudible) which is our large national healthcare delivery system predominantly hospital based in Brazil. Of course the political and economic instability certainly aren\u2019t helping the business today, but we have seen nice progress and we have an improved outlook for 2017 for the business.  You probably have noticed that we made a couple of augmentations to our leadership team down there. We just brought on Claudio Lottenberg, who was the former President of the Albert Einstein Health System. He is a fantastic leader, very well regarded across Brazil and we think he\u2019ll be a terrific addition to our business. We also named a Louis DeLuca to run our Americas health system. He came to us from Samaritano which was the large hospital that we acquired in San Paolo. And then we\u2019ve also added a number of other physicians in the business. I think strengthening leadership and importantly as we come across a five year anniversary looking to make sure that we have a very strong leadership team in place as we transition a generation.  Our new team is performing very well, they are focused on more modernized health system and building a strong healthcare infrastructure, and we continue to remain bullish and optimistic about not only the prospects for Amil and Americas (inaudible) but also Brazil broadly. Larry you\u2019re going to touch on Optum?\nLarry Renfro: Sure. A.J. its Larry. I think on the last earnings call, we talked a little about that. We have been building a foundation in London in the UK area, and we had spent past year really getting our self positioned in what I would call the new models care. We would know it here as the ACLs. As they are starting to take their trust and trust over there are their hospitals, and they are starting to put them together in certain segments of the country, and they\u2019re looking for services that we provide whether that be hospital type services or what we are doing with OptumCare. That\u2019s why there is a very large overlap here when you start talking about OptumCare and what we might be able to do in the UK area.  We are in bid and discussions with about five different areas, I won\u2019t go in to them from a competitive standpoint, and we believe in the first 6 to 9 months of this year, we shall start to see some outcome. So there\u2019s no question that it got delayed with Brexit and they\u2019ve had some change in terms of leadership and we\u2019ve had to establish ourselves with new leadership which just takes time. It\u2019s not an issue of them wanting to, they understand our model, a lot of the ministers have been here and they have visited our locations to see the integrated care and how we operate and so forth.  SCA should be a positive in terms of how we might look at that eventually, not right away in the UK. So I guess one part of the question is, we\u2019ve got the circled areas that we\u2019re talking about that we are in bids on right now, 6 to 9 months we should start to see some outcomes there and we feel pretty solid about that.  The other path we\u2019re going down is on what I\u2019ll call national programs and the big national programs is what I would call a national database where we could bring our data and analytics in to play. Again we are in the process with that and I would think that timing might be a little slower, it might six months, 3 to 6 months and the decision is ours.  So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. We\u2019ve got a good team, we\u2019re moving some senior leaders over to the UK and again I think that come summer time we should start to see some results there. \nStephen Hemsley: We\u2019ll do two or three more questions. So the next please. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. \nKevin Fischbeck: You said in the commentary that the exchange performance was better year-over-year. Was that simply just a lack of a PDR from the prior year or you\u2019re actually seeing stabilization. I think you last quarter you said that the Q3 results and the exchanges were stabilizing, wanted to see the color down to Q4.\nStephen Hemsley: I think it\u2019s broadly stable. \nDan Schumacher: Kevin, its Dan Schumacher. I think the point we\u2019re making there is, last year we recorded the Premium Deficiency Reserve to provide for losses in 2016, and so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, you had to drag in \u201915 and then we resolved the PDR and the exchanges in the fourth quarter this year. So that\u2019s the improvement we are talking about year-over-year. \nKevin Fischbeck: So versus Q3 it was stable?\nDan Schumacher: Versus Q3?\nKevin Fischbeck: Expectations versus Q3?\nDan Schumacher: Yeah, generally in line with expectations. \nStephen Hemsley: Our view on exchanges haven\u2019t changed. Next please. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Lance Wilkes from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nLance Wilkes: Yeah, I had a question on PBM margins, and just wanted to know a couple of points on those. One, as you saw improvement for the quarter, how much of that is mergers synergies and how much - as you look into 2017 of your merger synergy plan are you through? And then related to that would be what sort of trends are you seeing from both manufacturers and rebates on the cost side and what are the trends like on the client side as you look at your margins? \nStephen Hemsley: So that is about a four-part question Mark, so do you want to --?\nMark Thierer: So let me just talk about margins in this business. We\u2019ve talked for some time now that we\u2019re comfortable with operating margins in the 3-5 points, and so you asked about synergies. We met and actually exceeded our $0.30 commitment in the 2016 planned year. We\u2019ve not provided a specific outlook on synergies for \u201917, but I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve got running room in the plan and work to do still to extract synergies from the combination. So that has exceeded our expectations and been very solid and I would like to just tip the hat to the operating team who\u2019s made this work happen, it\u2019s been exceptional.  You asked about rebates and the picture going forward. This is the thing that we\u2019re paid to do. We\u2019re paid to go to the supply chain on behalf of our clients and extract savings for the benefit of the consumer and obviously for the plants sponsor. So we think that we\u2019ve created a business model here where we have best-in-class contracting capabilities that we take not just to the pharmaceutical industry, but we take it to the retail chains, we take it to the biotech manufacturers and we take it to the generic manufacturers as well as the wholesalers.  So this entire supply chain, this is our job to extract savings for the benefit of the member and for the benefit of the plan sponsor, and the outlook for that in this coming year is really very solid. Hopefully that answers your question.\nStephen Hemsley: Next question please. This will be our last. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our last question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nSheryl Skolnick: Thank you so much, and I will try not to make it too difficult for you this time. So you've obviously had very significant success across UHC as well as across Optum, and I'm going to ask a similar question to what I asked in a different way. We've also noticed some interesting trends on utilization, despite some spiking from the ACA in hospital based utilization, particularly in patient care.  And I'm wondering if you can help me to understand what steps you are taking and what you can attribute your management of cost trend, presumably related to appropriate controls on appropriate sites of care, and what the outlook might be given that you're now bringing OptumCare into a higher level of scale and capabilities with surgical care for your ability to further improve your cost trends through improved coordination and appropriateness of sight and timing and place of care? \nMark Thierer: Well you\u2019ve kind of defined the space in the question, so you clearly have grasped the idea. The ambulatory platform that we are forming is in fact a very important and viable proposition in and of itself, it represents the more organized, more informed deployment of resources in terms of ambulatory care and very much focused on the appropriateness of setting.  It also plays to themes that are clearly moving in the market place where these services are moving in to these better venues and in fact technology is a very powerful element behind it both in process and so forth. So it creates a better resource platform to serve consumers and that has implications for all that we serve. It is a multi-payer platform in UnitedHealthcare, it is an enterprise that is very effective and advancing on those and it provides them an advantage in terms of how they deploy it and integrate in to their offerings. So kind of that is a start, do you want to pick it up?\nDan Schumacher: Good morning Sheryl, Dan Schumacher. The only thing I would add, if you kind of look at it over the last eight years right, we\u2019ve been able to drive down on a per capita basis inpatient, and inside that we\u2019ve focused a lot in those early years around the conversion of inpatient to outpatient. And I think this is sort of the continued evolution as we focus more on the side of service to how do we get that outpatient in to the ambulatory setting.  So we\u2019ve continuing to introduce more steps in controlled measures on the front end, but more importantly trying to put in incentives at the surgeon level that really can help drive to the most appropriate settings. So the combination of (inaudible) structure with the consumer providing a strong motivator and then likewise on the delivery side trying to put incentives in place for the surgeons to be able to drive towards a more appropriate use. So we really look at this partnership as an opportunity to really strengthen our value orientation, both in our product designs as well as in our relationships with the professionals that are providing these surgeries. \nStephen Hemsley: And the OptumCare platform is free standing value up all by itself, so we basically have kind of a two-dimensional agenda going here and I think that\u2019s - whether that\u2019s core of your question and you\u2019ve grasped what we are doing in OptumCare very well. So again thank you for joining us today. I think the takeaways from this call are pretty straight forward that UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare represent a strong, diverse, well performing enterprise driven by mission and culture with strong leadership team, dedicated employees. We remain very committed to taking our performance to even higher levels of quality, value, growth, shareholder return and service to emerging needs of enormous global healthcare market place. So we continue to evolve and adapt to serve that market, helping people live healthier lives and making the system work better for everyone.  Thank you for joining us we\u2019ll see you next question. Thanks.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s call.

This quarter, we are privileged to report continued broad-based revenue and earnings growth, consistent execution and continuing forward momentum for our enterprise. We serve people's health and healthcare, a sensitive, social and personal domain that we know requires a mission and values-driven culture and a commitment to a quality experience, getting that experience right the first time for each individual we serve. We are advancing consciously and steadily in this direction. More to do to achieve the full potential and positive impact we can have on people's lives, on an access, cost and quality of care. We work to improve overall healthcare system performance through clinical insight, enabling technologies and distinctive data analytics, applying those capabilities across our businesses. This long-standing approach, consistently executed, continues to produce distinctive quality outcomes, balanced growth and steady financial performance. Third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew nearly $5 billion over last year or 12%. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $2.17 per share. Third quarter adjusted cash flows of $3.4 billion increased 22% over last year. And third quarter return on equity exceeded 21%.  Looking forward, we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter and into 2017. That performance will be built on strong customer retention and broad-based growth across our businesses, driven by deeper and more strategic relationships and new business awards already received. To take you deeper, Larry Renfro will discuss Optum's third quarter performance and then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry? \nLarry Renfro: Thank you, Steve. At Optum, we are pleased, once again, to report solid results for the third quarter and the year so far, with positive business momentum as we head into 2017. The market continues to affirm Optum's distinctive position as a scaled and broadly capable health services and innovation Company. We have aligned our resources to address enduring market trends around helping make this health system work better. We have strengthened fundamental capabilities, deepened relationships across the industry, including unique collaborations like OptumLabs and built a reputation for reliable service, even in challenging situations. And we balance investments in our core capabilities with the expectation that we consistently deliver operating earnings and returns on capital.  This quarter, we again closed several large, long term business awards. Quest Diagnostics has asked Optum360 to be their partner for revenue management, covering everything following the receipt of doctors' lab orders through billing and cash collections from health plans, payers and consumers. In collaboration with Quest, our analytics, processing approaches and technology can further modernize their business processes, improve service, lower cost, improve access to clinical and financial information and heighten transparency for consumers. Hospitals and acute-care facilities continue to move to Optum360's innovative revenue services products. Today, we serve more than 400 facilities through our patented computer-assisted medical coding technology. The number of facilities using our computerized documentation technology has doubled in the past year to more than 125. These represent solid advances in markets with significantly more growth and expansion within them. A recent BlackRock market research report estimated 85% of care providers are assessing and/or replacing their approach to revenue management over the next few years. For the third consecutive year, the experts at BlackRock have ranked Optum360 as the best in the market in revenue cycle management software technology, in revenue cycle management outsourcing and in computer-assisted coding and health information outsourcing solutions. During this coming quarter, Optum360 will reach a run rate of $60 billion in annual customer billings. This quarter, consulting leader Frost & Sullivan named Optum the top population health management company in the nation, based on their assessment of the Optum One technology. Optum One integrates patient clinical information with administrative and demographic data covering millions of people. Proprietary analytics are applied to healthcare providers, identify and take action with patients who are at highest risk of adverse health developments. Today, nearly 700 facilities and nearly 7,000 medical clinics are using Optum One, growth of 28% year over year. We see a broad range of opportunities in helping enable ACOs as this emerging market evolves. The rise of ACOs and value-based care in the market will only increase Optum One's utility and value. OptumHealth revenues continue to grow strongly, led by OptumCare Local Care Delivery. OptumCare leverages modern technology and data and analytics to improve clinical care and offer superior quality and value to patients, payers and physicians. Aligning care delivery improves the health of communities at the local level; in fact, perhaps nowhere else can the potential benefits of individuals be as profound. And while OptumCare already comprises more than half of OptumHealth's revenues, we are still early in developing this business. You should expect to see us continue to build out OptumCare market by market to emerge as a national platform for primary care-driven ambulatory care services. We aim to expand our care delivery through owned or affiliated clinics to more than 75 local markets, where more than 200 million people reside. This quarter, OptumHealth was honored to receive a multi-billion-dollar award from the Veterans Administration to conduct medical disability exams for servicemen and women for a period of up to five years. This award highlights some of the unique services we can offer governments as customers and shows how the diversity of our capabilities and customer segments drives overall growth. OptumRx continues to advance our pharmacy care services business. This is another example of how we can help make the health system work better when we integrate across the Optum platform. We differentiate through the value of superior data analytics, clinical integration and consumer engagement at the earliest point of care possible. OptumHealth, with its deep expertise, scaled capabilities and assets in care management, clinical insights and population health, is helping to enable this transformation to what we call pharmacy care services. The value of this approach is particularly evident in the areas of chronic care and specialty pharmacy, where we generate more value for benefit sponsors and consumers than anyone in this market. And we are still only in the early stages in the evolution of this approach. The market is responding to our focus on total cost. OptumRx continues to perform well and expects to build on the success seen during 2017 selling season for 2018 and beyond. Our customer retention rate for January 2017 will be in the high 90%s. OptumInsight's backlog grew 24% year over year to $12.6 billion and script growth at OptumRx and the number of people served by OptumHealth continue to grow, consistent with our expectations. Optum's third quarter revenues grew 9.4%. Our third quarter operating earnings grew 28% year over year to approach $1.5 billion. Year-to-date earnings from operations are up 40% to more than $3.8 billion. Our third quarter operating margin of 6.9% expanded both sequentially and year-over-year, led by OptumInsight's margin and offset by continued investments in the OptumHealthcare Delivery businesses. We recognize Optum remains a young company, still in the formative stages in many respects and requiring continued investment and improvement. We know we can and should perform better and in turn, help %s make the health system work better for more people.  Now, let me turn it over to Dave. \nDave Wichmann: Thank you, Larry. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong growth and performance at UnitedHealthcare. Over the past 12 months, UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve more than 2 million more people, once again, with solid growth across all three domestic medical markets. This continues the remarkable organic growth trend at UnitedHealthcare. Over the half decade leading up to 2016, we came to serve 9 million more people with medical benefits in domestic markets. We are delivering value through a combination of innovative and expansive product and service capabilities, data-driven consumer engagement and decision resources and modern value-based relationships with care providers, supported by data sharing and physician engagement. These capabilities engage and support consumers while containing costs for both the health consumer as well as their benefit sponsors. Our full-year commercial medical cost trend remains solidly in line with our estimate of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. The market continues to respond positively to the value UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual plans offer. Excluding individual plans, our Commercial Group business has grown to serve 775,000 more people year over year continuing its consistent pattern of growth. In six of the past seven calendar years, our Employer & Individual business has grown the number of consumers served, with cumulative growth across all products, totaling in the millions of people, all of it organic. In the seniors' market, UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirements performance continues to strengthen each year. In the past 12 months, more than 600,000 additional seniors have chosen our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products. These plans have excellent consumer retention rates and distinctive consumer Net Promoter Scores. The strength in our Medicare business is grounded in the quality of our benefit offerings, the stability of our networks and a distinctive clinical engagement and consumer experience approach. This approach directly engages our own clinical resources when data suggests we need to better coordinate care. These activities improve consumer satisfaction or NPS and strengthen loyalty, customer retention, Stars performance and the use of healthcare resources, all leading to better value for seniors. Our Medicare Advantage Plans are increasingly recognized for quality and service. For 2018, factoring in our expected growth, we expect 85% of UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Advantage membership will be in plans rated four stars or higher by CMS. For 2017, we expect this metric to exceed 80%. This quarter, our Group retiree call centers achieved JD Power's certification, placing them among the highest-performing in consumer services across all industries. This accomplishment reflects the commitment and compassion of our Medicare team, who seek to serve seniors with high-quality healthcare and flawless service. We expect 2017 to be another year of strong growth, both in individual and group MA. We also expect to grow in Part D in 2017, with the introduction of a new nationwide product set, targeted to a broader senior demographic. Our community and state plans have grown steadily in response to state governments' needs, to improve quality for beneficiaries, while ensuring the sustainability of their programs. The increase in Medicaid benefit coverage has been a clear success of the Affordable Care Act, serving millions of more Americans and using public funds in the most effective way. Our ability to improve quality and outcomes for all types of Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with some of the most complex medical conditions, has driven distinguished overall growth for us for a number of years, including organic growth of 9% or nearly 500,000 people in the past 12 months. Our commitment to quality care, outcomes and service have led to our position as the largest organization serving programs for dual eligible beneficiaries and those who need long term services and support.  Today, we serve more than 0.5 million of these vulnerable individuals for our state customers and our growth in these categories continues. This past quarter, we were honored to be selected to proceed to contract in Virginia, in what will be another new state partner for us. And in just the past few days, we were selected to serve in Missouri, also a new state for our community and state business. Our new business and growth opportunities for 2017 and beyond are as robust as ever.  Looking at these benefits businesses together, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues of $37.2 billion, grew 13.3% year-over-year, with organic growth, again, across the three businesses. The same organic growth has been experienced over the past several years. Every business grew revenues by a double-digit percentage over third quarter 2015. Earnings from operations of $2.1 billion also grew 13% year over year on steady operating margins of 5.7%.  Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, our third quarter revenues of $46.3 billion grew 12% over last year. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points to 80.3%. Through the first nine months of the year, our medical care ratio of 81.3% is nearly identical to last year. The operating cost ratio has improved 60 basis points year to date, to 15%. The third quarter ratio of 15.2% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the regular, seasonal increase in marketing and enrollment costs as well as increased level of investment across the enterprise to develop and support future growth.  As Steve mentioned, third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 grew 23% year over year and were supported by distinctive cash flow. Year-to-date adjusted cash flows from operations of $7.4 billion or 1.4 times net income and adjusted cash flow was 1.7 times net income in the third quarter. We are increasing our outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings to approximately $8 per share due to the strength of the results produced by our businesses so far this year. We look to finish 2016 with strong momentum and carry that momentum into 2017.  At this point of the year, the focus begins to shift to the coming year. And we look forward to discussing our 2017 outlook with you in depth at our Investor conference on Tuesday, November 29. While we will reserve that discussion for another six weeks, we will offer that, at this point, we are comfortable with where the consensus 2017 adjusted earnings per share are currently positioned on the Street.  We remain committed to continually improving our performance. If we finish the year with the momentum we aspire to, we could potentially see our 2017 EPS view reflect a modestly stronger growth outlook. For now, we will maintain an appropriately prudent posture. Steve? \nStephen Hemsley: Thank you, Dave. I think at this point, it's important to acknowledge something we don't do enough and that's the tremendous effort of our employees and the efforts they make to bring our mission into the day-to-day reality of helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. They exhibit the values we share across this Company as they do that work, values of integrity, compassion, innovation, relationships and performance. Our thanks to their commitment and hard work.  As we move toward 2017, our enterprise is well-positioned. You can hear the optimism in Larry and Dave's commentary today and see it in the consistency of our performance. Our businesses are aligned to important market trends and delivering value to the increasing number of customers and people we serve. There is still a long way to go to serve at the peak of our potential. It is up to us to execute and we are privileged to have that opportunity.  Thank you for your interest this morning. Operator, we can now take questions. Again, one per analyst, please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: I just wanted to ask on the outlook for the rest of the year for Optum, is it still your expectation that you will have about 60% of the earnings growth weighted to the back half? I'm asking because it's -- looks like that's going to be a pretty big sequential jump implied in the Optum earnings or margins, at least from how we're modeling it. If you could comment on that and maybe if there's anything you can tell us about the organic change that you've seen year to date in the Optum non-intersegment revenues. It's just challenging to track that. \nStephen Hemsley: Sure. I think those patterns are pretty consistent with prior periods, but Larry, do you want to take that and then maybe John Rex or whatever, we'll finish off. But Larry, do you want to start? \nLarry Renfro: A couple things, I think past history in terms of how our business is lined up this way currently shows that the fourth quarter for Optum is always going to pretty much play out this way and I will talk about that in a minute. The third quarter, strong quarter for us. It met expectations and we are exactly where we expect it to be right now in terms of our in-line expectations. The fourth quarter always brings to us seasonality and when we get into the seasonality, we're dealing with pay for performance. We're dealing with our incentives and our shared savings. What we're doing from a technology standpoint during the year, a lot of that comes to play and impacts us during the fourth quarter. The number of new accounts that we have, as well as AEP kicks in; some of our coding kicks in. So we have a lot on the list side in the fourth quarter, but what I might do is talk a little bit about what our overall business plan has been. Our overall business plan has been to have these large, what I will call, complex relationships and when we get into that and this is all part of how we build this during the year, we expected to have around 10 of these major relationships. We are probably somewhere around 20 at this point in time and this has been building over the last few years. We have three measurements that kick into this as well and that is our backlog. And I think I mentioned this a few minutes ago on inside of about $12.6 billion; that's up about 24% year over year. We had our qualified sales pipeline that will also kick in, possibly during the fourth quarter. That's up about 2 times over last year. And the third area is our sales for this year. What I call our TCV, our total contract value; that's up about 3 times. So we're confident where we're at right now for the fourth quarter. We believe the fourth quarter will give us momentum into 2017 so we're right where we expect it to be. I will tell you that this time next year, if we're sitting here, we will be having the same conversation because it will constantly be a seasonality issue for us to deal with in the fourth quarter. \nJohn Rex: Yes, absolutely expect those seasonal patterns to continue, as we've seen over the years. If anything, when you think about where the bias of sales to and growth is within the Optum businesses, that should be an actual outcome in terms of that seasonality persisting. So what you want to think about there in terms of businesses that have that type of pattern, think about some of the quality solutions businesses, data sales and analytics, the timing and delivery of the large deals and certainly, seeing plenty of large deals across the spectrum this year, some of the networks solutions businesses. All of those businesses are typically second-half weighted in terms of their performance and that's a pattern that we would expect to persist. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Appreciate the early view on 2017 and you talked about being comfortable with consensus EPS which implies of about 14% year-over-year growth with potential for upside given the business momentum. When we adjust for the benefit of exiting the ACA individual market for next year, that growth looks closer to about 9% to 10%, if I'm doing the math right. Just curious in terms of how you think about the main headwinds and tailwinds year over year we should consider when thinking that growth rate relative to your long term growth expectations. \nDave Wichmann: So as you said, we will discuss 2017 at our Investor Conference in November. I think the largest tailwind for the business, as you're probably picking up, is growth, both at Optum which you've seen pretty systemically throughout the year, with the PDM wins and obviously, here with the Quest win which is Optum360 win as well as and I'll call a lot of the smaller business size wins that occur in that business every day, a lot of which you'll see in that ramp in the Q4 as well. All of those things speak to Optum's growth and I think UnitedHealthcare's growth is statistically well understood with the pattern of growth and its membership across all three lines of business. The second one I would point out is the reduced loss position on the ACA. That clearly will aid earnings in 2017 as well. On the headwinds front, obviously with that growth, there's a lot of implementation costs that need to occur and then as you can tell, we're strategically positioning Optum to have a broader range and serve in more market segments as well. So there's a lot of de novo start-up costs, if you will, in that business as well as a lot of implementation costs for the substantive business that we've won over time.  The last thing I guess I would point out in 2017, particularly, at this distance and maybe a reason why you feel like we're -- we may be more moderate in terms of our point of view at this early stage, this organization has a deep respect for medical costs and trend. And while we expect them to be pretty level, our trends to be pretty level next year, we're deeply respectful of medical costs as well as the rating environment. As those things become clearer, that's when I think you'll see us clarify our position with respect to 2017 and that could be as early in the 2017 Investor Conference in November. \nStephen Hemsley: Our commentary today was an attempt to be pretty positive about 2017 and I think the commentary about if momentum continues and we have every reason to believe that it will, l that we can be even stronger, but I really think that whole conversation really should -- is better had more face-to-face at the Investor Conference. So our purpose today is to give you some positive body language on 2017, but really the further conversation is at the Investor Conference. So if you kind of take it from that spirit, that's the right way. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: I wanted to ask a question around OptumRx and drug costs trend. If you could comment on your views, generally about drug costs trend and then within your OptumRx business, are you seeing or are you deploying particular strategies that you think are delivering a competitively better drug cost trend? Or should I think about the competitive differentiation being through the synchronization function and seeing savings elsewhere in medical benefits as you are interacting with pharmacy members? Thanks. \nLarry Renfro: I think the answer to that is really both and I think the distinctive dimensions of the OptumRx business is that they are really kind of redefining pharmacy care services to be much more integrated into the clinical continuum, to have impact on medical costs and to engage earlier. At the same time, be able to bring leading-edge perspectives to the procurements of a drug and supply chain. So Mark, do you want to comment? \nMark Thierer: I appreciate the question and I would say that the one thing our clients are focused on and hiring us to do is to manage their pharmacy costs. One of the reasons I'm excited about this business is there is no one in the industry who has the data, analytic and delivery assets, really, that Optum possesses and so you mentioned synchronization. And as you know, this is a data-driven approach. It's been central to the wins that we posted this year from some very large and sophisticated buyers. So this is a new approach and we do think we're redefining pharmacy care services, taking pharmacy data, coupling it and linking it to medical data, linking it to the care delivery process and including lab, behavioral data in a comprehensive data set. We call it, [indiscernible] and the whole business is focused on now a whole-person approach. How can we take everything we know about a member's medical condition and improve their care, utilizing cost strategies and cross trend management strategies, that you mentioned, but much more than that, delivering care in a more meaningful way. This could include phone calls by pharmacist, housecalls by nurses. This could include adherence programs; it's a full suite of programs, all aimed at driving down total medical costs. And so I would say that's one thing that is setting us apart in the market. We're feeling very good about where we stand in our position and we can see it in our pipeline and the growth opportunities that we're chasing. So thank you for the question. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Newshel: Can you maybe give us some more detail on why you directed the increased level of investments that you mentioned as raising the operating cost ratio? How much spending was not previously planned and incremental to the third quarter and also, is there anything incremental planned in Q4 that you even had planned earlier in the year? \nJohn Rex: Just a little bit on OCR. First of all, I would say that in line with our view here in terms of how we trended in the 3Q, so the first perspective being from 2Q to 3Q, there was a sequential increase of about 60 basis points in the OCR and that is typical of what we see as we move into the open enrollment period and the investments and spend to prepare for that as the season began. So that is a typical move. And I think you're referring particularly to the year-over-year move of a 30 basis point increase. That's, as you stated, primarily driven by increased investments. I cite a few places where we were making investments in the quarter.  Things you may have heard us referred to in the past and maybe you've been familiar with, the ongoing Stars investments, medical affordability and clinical investments, specific businesses that we've been very vocal on in terms of where we expect to grow and invest such as the OptumCare businesses. And then I would put up costs related to preparing for the growth we expect in 2017 across a number of the businesses, within our senior businesses, in M&R, some of the Optum businesses where you've seen there have been very -- some significant new business awards for next year as we prepare for that. Just a general upward pressure also that we see fee comparisons growth. All of this, as you would expect from us normally on offset partially by the productivity gains that we've logged. So within our expectations, if I sum it up and those are the types of investments that we're making. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ralph Jacoby from Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Jacoby: I was hoping you could maybe just walk through the favorable development in the quarter. They came off last quarter that had an unfavorable development from both current and prior year and this quarter obviously had favorable, particularly in the first half. So our estimates last quarter is essentially overly conservative on the exchange specifically. But also sort of the unfavorable development from last year; just hoping you could flush out all those moving parts and maybe which end markets are impacted? Thanks. \nDan Schumacher: So maybe I will start broadly on medical costs overall. From our view, certainly in the quarter, costs were well controlled and as you look at the consolidated medical care ratio, it was 80.3% in the third quarter this year and that's actually down 60 basis points year over year, so down a little bit more than we had expected. So we continue to do well managing costs across the portfolio within UnitedHealthcare. To the components of development specifically, so underneath that, we did have prior period reserve development in the quarter. That was about $120 million and that was favorable. That's pretty consistent with the development we recorded in the same quarter last year. As you look of the pieces inside of it, to your question, the current year component was favorable $230 million and that was partially offset by $110 million of prior-year unfavorable developments. With regard to the businesses, I would tell you that it's really less about the Exchanges, frankly and it's more about our core businesses across Medicare/Medicaid and our Commercial business, both the current year favorable as well as the prior-year favorable. And on the prior-year unfavorable, I'd tell you that we do have a host of things that resolve in any given quarter. There was nothing in this quarter that was individually material and that prior-year element does not influence our current or our future outlook on trends. So as we look to the full-year and look at our medical costs, we expect the medical care ratio of 81.5% on the full year, plus or minus 50 basis points and I would probably tell you it would likely orient below that midpoint. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nPeter Costa: My question is on the margins in the Medicare business. Last year, you had higher spending for Medicare Star scores that impacted your Medicare performance. This year, did that spending continue at the same level or does it come down a little bit? And then going into next year, how do you plan to utilize the HIF holiday given that the health insurance fee comes back in 2018 so what should I think about for a trended margins last year to this year to next year to 2018? \nSteve Nelson: I will start by just giving a broad perspective on how we think about 2017 as we enter -- I think we're three days into our annual enrollment period for 2017. I really think we are well-positioned overall. As you mentioned, we've seen improvement in our Stars and when we contemplated our benefit planning, back in the Spring, we obviously considered that, had insight into that and also the insurers' fee moratorium as well. That allowed us to make some meaningful investments and bring to market some stable benefits that we're really excited to offer to our seniors.  It's meaningful to them, the stability and premiums and co-pays and choice. We think we're really well-positioned. Then you add to that the capabilities that we've been investing in as well in terms of our quality which benefits our members but also, something that we're going to stay diligent about. We also have, I think, Dave mentioned in his opening comments, some of the distinguished capabilities that we have in our member experience and service, so all of these positions leave room for growth but in terms of the margin specifically, we wanted the positions business for growth and we think we have done that. The margins we target between 3% and 5%, we're operating toward the upper end of that range at this point and expect to continue to do that in 2017. \nStephen Hemsley: We think we spent more on Stars, but we also get benefits from Stars, the performance in Stars has really been highlighted and-- \nSteve Nelson: Yes. On the Stars-specific investment question I would say that we -- this time last year, actually, we were talking about investments, strategic investments we were making in Stars and we continue at about the same level looking for more effectiveness, more efficiency and some productivity gains. But generally, at the same level, don't expect that to initially increase, but we are getting really strong returns and we're very excited about the performance and the results that we're seeing in Stars. \nStephen Hemsley: Very stable, so stability is the order of the day in terms of approach. This is a business that was challenging a few years back and has been brought back into line. So very positive. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Scott Fidel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nScott Fidel: Interested if you can give us an update on how the net new business pipeline has developed for OptumRx for 2017? And then, also separately, maybe an update on the commercial side in terms of how the national accounts' selling season ended up shaping up for you guys? \nStephen Hemsley: So that is a two-part question. Mark, do you want to take the first part? \nMark Thierer: Well, we feel pretty good about the scorecard from 2016. As you know, we posted some very large wins, what I would categorize as some of the smartest and most sophisticated buyers signing on with OptumRx. I think these large wins validated our model. I mean, we've put this business together. We're a year and a few months into and I do think the strategic rationale for the combination is proving out. I think at the end of the day, the reason that we are posting these wins is, first of all, we are driving better economics in the market. That's important when you're trying to save money on drugs, but it is this differentiated model that we're selling. The pharmacy care services model is resonating with very sophisticated buyers. I think what you're seeing, Scott, is the convergence of the traditional PBM model which we're trying to rebuild and combining it with the Optum Clinical platform. Here we're talk about OptumHealth and all of the care management, data management and care delivery services. So I think if you start to look at it, we've emerged as a sort of destination platform in this industry and feel very good about the selling season and the wins that we'll post and bring live in 2017. \nJeff Alter: Just comment on the national accounts season. We're wrapping up that 2017 selling season now and as we've talked about in the past, this was a fairly light season for active employees and it is played out this way. We continue to be able to manage our client retention well up in the high 90%s which is a testament to the value and the relationships that the value that we bring to those clients and the relationships that we have.  We'll probably wind up with a relatively flat membership result, when you take into account the success of our Group's MA efforts. So on that front, as I said, it was a fairly light active season but we saw a very, very robust season for Group MA and as Mark mentioned, some of the PBM offerings.  And I think what we really showed to the marketplace is that we can take the value of this enterprise to bear on those opportunities and we are combining the unique expertise of the Commercial business, our Medicare business and our OptumRx business and bringing really seamless solutions to the marketplace for our clients. And we've produced a very successful result for the 2017 selling season for both our Group MA business and our OptumRx business. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: I just want to talk about capital deployment and specifically, share buybacks. I know you guys have been intent on reducing your leverage this year, but looks like it was relatively slow in the first half and really fell off again in the third quarter so I guess I'm curious one, was there something in the market that give you pause around share buybacks? And then how do we think about 2017? Is that a more normal return to a more normal pattern for UnitedHealth Group? \nLarry Renfro: I think we're completely in line with our plan and pattern so we don't view this as anything of that nature and we have reduced debt, so I think it's all line with plan. John? \nJohn Rex: Josh, particularly on share repurchase, but for the year, we had anticipated $1 billion to $1.5 billion in total share repurchase. In the first half, we did about $1 billion so we anticipated that we would be slowing meaningfully in the second half of the year. We repurchased about $140 million in the third quarter, so consistent in terms of our full-year expectations in that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. Nearer term, you're right. We've been focused on delevering our balance sheet and applying more than free cash flow to debt reduction but the pattern that you've seen this year, consistent with kind of how we've approached the year in terms of our share repurchase activities. \nStephen Hemsley: So I don't think there's anything that's -- and nor do we plan to stray from that, so our capital allocation approaches are perfectly consistent. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: I was hoping to get a few more details on your ACA-compliant individual business and I guess, happy that it's not a big topic of conversation for the first time in a few quarters but one, wondering if you could give us both your on and off-Exchange compliant enrollment. Two, I think in the third quarter a year ago, almost 20% of the individual compliant enrollment was coming through special enrollment period. I wonder where that stood this year versus the 20% last year? And then just finally, presumably the MLR in the first half of the year has been pressured as you booked additional full-year losses for your ACA-compliant businesses and I suppose we flip to the point where the PDR is probably now helping the medical loss ratio. So any color you could give on either how much the PDR came down or maybe even just what your MLR looks like in your ACA-compliant business this quarter versus a year ago? Just some help on what how that's shaping up versus the projected losses? \nDan Schumacher: First, to the enrollment. So on the enrollment front, we ended the quarter with 770,000 Exchange lives and another 210,000 Off the Exchange rate, so on a combined basis, our individual ACA block was just under a shade under 1 million lives at the end of the quarter. When you look at the performance inside the quarter, I would tell you that, as you pointed out, nothing has really changed on the ACA front and that's a good thing. Our third quarter was very much in line with our revised expectations that we set coming out of the second quarter and we continue to maintain our full-year view. To be more specific about it, so we recorded losses in the quarter of $200 million and of that, $120 million was offset against the premium deficiency reserve and the remaining $80 million flowed trough the P&L this quarter. That $80 million of P&L impact is very comparable to the P&L impact we had in the third quarter last year, so very similar year over year. From our view, we think that we're appropriately positioned for the remainder of the year. I think you also asked about the contribution of enrollment from special election versus open enrollment. I would tell you that we have a little less orientation towards special election this year as compared to last year. So to your point, we were a little shade above 20% sitting through the third quarter of the year and now we're more in the mid-teens as you look at our ACA-compliant membership base. Hopefully, that covers the list. \nOperator: We will take our next question from AJ Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAJ Rice: Probably just go back to the discussion around Optum. If I think about the announcements you've had this quarter the Quest announcement takes you into a new area for revenue cycle management, the VA contract, certainly dramatically expands the business with the government in that area. I know you've talked about DoD contracts as well and I think there's been ongoing commentary about discussions with international governments and NHS, for example. Can you just talk about the expanding opportunities that Optum has? And what are some of the pie-in-the-sky opportunities looking out two or three years for Optum? \nStephen Hemsley: I don't think we think of them as pie-in-the-sky, but I think Larry can respond to that. \nLarry Renfro: Let me start with international and I'm going to ask a couple of people to help me out. I'll ask Bill to join into this and I might ask Amir to join in from an OptumCare standpoint and I think Mark's already covered it, but on the international front, I would say we've spent the last year-and-a-half building our foundation. We've been planting seeds and I would say that we're strong with the NHS. We're strong with NHS improvement. We are getting stronger with Minister of Health as well as the Secretary of Health. As we sit here today, we actually have the Minister of Health with us for the next two or three days on tour, with quite a few of the Commissioners of the Trust which would be hospitals, the way we would know it.  I would say that as we've gone through this with the relationship building and where we stand, the pipeline is getting stronger and I believe that 2017 will be a year that we will validate, as we've been validating some things here in the States. So that's where I would say that the international sits in the UK. We are also working with our sister organization, Amil, in Brazil and that's more of a health plan, as you know, the way that we would approach that from our standpoint. So we're working day in, day out to line up with them. We are also looking at other emerging markets. We are looking, probably the way we would go about is look at Australia, maybe Mexico, maybe Asia, but we're going to finish out what we're doing with the UK and have a very solid start as well as in Brazil before we start to pursue other things. Again, we've talked about that market potentially being a $500 billion market and we remain focused and confident that, that 's the size of that market. We move over into what we're doing on the, what I'll call, our large, deeper relationships and I spoke about that both in the script as well as on the other answer. Instead of me speaking on this, I'm going to ask Bill to talk about it from an OptumInsight360 standpoint and some of the large relationships we're working with and then I'm going to ask Amir to do the same on the, what I'll call, the OptumCare side. I will make one comment myself of what we're doing in the military. We were able to get this nice award with the Veterans Administration on disability exams. So we won about 8 out of 12 regions, exactly 8 out of 12 regions. Four at LHI; that's in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. Four in California with MSLA that we own, it will service about 4.2 million servicemen and women and we'll be going strong with that starting in January of this year. So, Bill? \nBill Miller: With respect to our revenue management offerings, we've used this word, validation, a fair number of times this morning. And I think in the case of the win that we had with Quest, it just validates once again that our boundaries of where we can offer these technology-enabled services is expanding. And I think Quest represents that as one of the largest, if not the largest web diagnostic companies in the world. I think whether it's a health plan, whether it's an employer, whether it's a health system, they all go through a rigorous evaluation process and whether it's Quest or Dignity which we've talked about in the past, they're looking for modern technology, modern systems. They are looking for people that can bring in accuracy and the expertise that could reengineer workflows, that can leverage a worldwide workforce and peppering in all of that is someone who can drive analytics and insights to really automate and improve the economic performance and the efficiency performance of their own operations. And anyone that evaluates us likes to see that, one, we're comprehensive in that approach; two, we pretty much line up culturally with them and they really enjoy the fact that we drive a performance-based contract with them. So we're very much focused on aligning ourselves with them so that they are successful. That formula is working. It's highly enabled by a very modern set of portfolios that, as Dave said, people buy every day but more and more, we're seeing a trend in the marketplace where any of those constituencies are looking for more of an end-to-end comprehensive approach to handling some of these most pronounced challenges they have in their environments and Optum becomes a pretty formidable and desirable option in those contexts. So with that said, maybe I will turn it over to Amir. \nAmir Dan Rubin: So we are continuing to see great growth on the OptumCare side. As you know, we have laid out 75 strategic markets that we see as important for ourselves to be in. We are well in over half of those markets and we continue to see growth into new markets as well as growth within those markets. And within those markets, we are seeing growth across different payer categories and were also seeing growth across the continuum of care access.  We also continue to grow our MedExpress centers. We see great success in our consumerism approach there with MedExpress and we'll continue to expand those assets. And we also see ourselves addressing more and more complex populations, dual eligibles, of course, Medicare Advantage, special needs population as well.  So we will continue to see that and then to find these capabilities leveraging the capabilities from OptumInsight and our analytics, risk stratification into our Care Delivery Groups and now as Larry mentioned, applying those capabilities from OptumCare and OptumInsight abroad globally. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: The quarter looks pretty good overall so I'm going to go back and harp on the one thing that I feel just doesn't look right to me which was the negative prior-year development. We're not used to seeing that from you guys at all. Now we've seen it two quarters in a row so I just wanted to understand how comfortable you are with the reserves.  Just to get a little more color, I understand that you mentioned there's a lot of things going on and it was more the core business than Exchanges this quarter. But any color you can provide there about what was really driving that, because we're just not used to seeing it? It looks like at this rate, you may be showing some of the lowest growth development you've seen in the last decades I just wanted to understand your visibility into reserves and what's been driving that recently? \nStephen Hemsley: I will just commentary before Dan gets to it, is that we don't really strive for the -- a formula development numbers. We try to get as accurate as possible, so if we have absolutely no development, it would absolutely actually be perfect. I think you shouldn't read anything too much into this beyond the fact that we continue to be very vigilant and making sure that our trends are appropriate, our reserves are appropriate and true things up in an appropriate timeframe. Dan, do you want to come back and comment one more time? \nDan Schumacher: Well, Kevin, I would just add that when you put it in the context of our total medical spend, what you're seeing and, as Steve mentioned, is greater accuracy. So last year, we had worth of $100 billion of medical spend across the platform. This year, we'll be north of $115 billion and what you're seeing is, as we bring more rigor, better analytics, through a better system connectivity, we tie-in, more real-time, to delivery partners, you're seeing improvements in the accuracy of those estimates.  And as you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we're sitting on $190 million of prior-year favorable development. That compares to $230 million for the three quarters last year. So from our perspective, there's some vagaries that happen quarter to quarter but on balance, we continue to get more accurate and for us, that's our aim. And as I mentioned at the outset, our medical costs continue to be well-controlled and they are coming in a little bit better than we expect in an aggregate, so that's great. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Baker from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: With the Section 1332 Waivers going into effect, January 2017, do you expect any states to meaningfully alter their approach to either addressing the broken public exchange and managing healthcare costs? \nStephen Hemsley: I would say we should be a little bit retrospect with respect to our view of how states will approach Exchanges and how Exchanges will play out in the new administration, so we're really not interested in commenting on that. What I would say is that our agenda here has been very focused on solid opportunities for access around simplifying the environment in total, about going into managing the costs and keeping the affordability of these programs more relevant to the marketplace and to really kind of lean to the programs that have really worked extremely well. Medicaid has been a very significant success of the ACA and wherever that has played out, those markets have actually been more stable and better performing. And Medicare continues to be a core program of the country and that funding for both Medicare and Medicaid is something that we have been advocating consistency and stability of it. Kind of those themes are what we have stayed with. I think commenting beyond that, particularly as new administrations take hold and so forth, our posture is to be very constructive about making the marketplace work most effectively and serving the most number of individuals and making that system simpler and more usable for everybody. So I think beyond commenting on that level, I don't think we are going to get into what's going to happen going forward on either a state basis or federal. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChristine Arnold: A couple has been asked. On Medicaid, what are you seeing in terms of the rate outlook and the margin outlook there? I know some of the expansion states are coming through with some pretty hefty rate cuts. You continue to gain business so even though you've improved margins on the businesses new to you, so how do we think about that? And then with respect to OptumRx, you won -- you're going to doing Medicare Advantage. You're going to be growing PDP; you've got these new contracts offset by minor losses of membership relative to all of that and individual so top line looks like it is going to be up a lot. But if you have to give up margin with this new business, how should we think about the Optum margin next year -- Rx, OptumRx? \nStephen Hemsley: I thought you were going to Medicaid, so we'll start that way with Austin and then we'll finish with respect to the OptumRx. Austin? \nAustin Pittman: So there's really not a lot different in the Medicaid rating environment today than there has been over the past several years. As you know, states continue to be challenged to balance their budgets while continuing to develop new, high-quality programs to care for, as been mentioned already today, larger and larger populations and many of those populations with much more complex needs. We are honored to play a role in helping them do that and give consistency to both the quality, delivery and the consistency in cost for their programs. We continue to see race in the low single digits, keeping pace with medical and really, you've got to look at this, pluses and minuses in line with the specific economic situation of a particular state. So again, nothing particularly different. We continue to see things come out in line with our expectations. \nMark Thierer: So it is true that we've seen good membership growth in MA and PDP and obviously, the performance in UnitedHealthcare has been strong, as has a number of other health plan clients that we service so we're not going to get into the 2017 outlook, as we've said that will be covered in the 2017 Investor Conference coming up. I will comment though on the margin profile. I think that we're very comfortable with the current margin profile. We've talked about performing in the 3% to 5% range. We've not had to underwrite business at a deficit and we're comfortable that the business will perform at that level for the foreseeable future. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.\nChris Rigg: Most of the big questions have been asked, but just to clarify on some questions on Optum. When you talk about the growth in Healthcare Delivery business and the behavioral services, one on the Healthcare Delivery side, is that primarily MedExpress and can you give us a sense for how the units have trended since you've acquired it in the Spring of 2015? And then on the behavioral side, when you say expansion into new Medicaid markets, are you -- does that mean you're layering a specialty service into existing Medicaid managed care contracts or it's completely new business line out at the Medicaid level? Thanks a lot. \nAmir Dan Rubin: Chris, this is Amir Rubin. I could take both of those. So we're continuing to see a lot of growth on the OptumCare side, both on the Local Care Delivery, our Medical Practices as well as on MedExpress. MedExpress, I think you -- specifically, we now have over 180 centers in 16 states and we're planning to grow to over 200 by year-end and we're continuing to see investments into the future there on that platform which has been very successful. In OptumCare, we're now managing approximately 20,000 physicians, serving over 8 million consumers, as I said, in almost now 51 geographic markets and so we'll continue to see growth there. We also serve through our special needs program in OptumHealth and our conference care management over 2000 specialty nursing facilities so we will continue to see growth there. On the behavioral side, we are seeing growth both at the Medicaid level and having success with wins in states as well as on the commercial side, selling more business to employers and through to health plans as well. \nChris Rigg: But nothing that's actually structurally integrated into these new proposals and things like that. \nAmir Dan Rubin: Correct. \nStephen Hemsley: It's basically operated on an open-market integrated basis. \nAmir Dan Rubin: Correct. \nStephen Hemsley: So we'll take about two more questions, I think. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nAna Gupte: It sounds like with that 80.3% on the loss ratio, your Commercial Group underwriting spread seems like it's pretty stable. You sound confident on the cost trend. Any thoughts on the trends you're seeing in the selling season on pricing as the Blue Cross Blue Shield seem to have to expand on Exchanges and maybe sustaining more losses. Is that influencing their pricing posture? And then secondly, on the self-insured side, what are the mix shifts doing and is that, in any way, impacting the price competition in fully insured? \nStephen Hemsley: I'm not sure I can piece that question together fully. I think it's really around pricing. We're not going to comment really about others or what others might be experiencing but we can kind of give you some commentary with respect to what our pricing philosophies are. And I think we're in pretty good shape as it relates to the coming years. So, Jeff? \nJeff Alter: I will comment on what we see in the marketplace in general and I'll just say what we see in the marketplace in general is affirming of pricing particularly in the fully insured which has helped us to grow because of our remaining -- our historical discipline in pricing continues. We always price our businesses to our view of our forward-cost trends and as you look back into our 2014 year, that -- we took some losses because of that discipline and now as those markets begin to firm again, we're growing in those marketplaces. So I think the general tone in the marketplace right now is it remains a competitive environment and we believe that will continue through the 2017 season in small business in key accounts but most importantly, what we focus on is making sure our products add value to our clients and are priced appropriately for our forward view of cost. \nStephen Hemsley: We're not seeing anything unusual in terms of the pricing environment. \nJeff Alter: No. If anything, it's a pretty benign environment right now. \nStephen Hemsley: Both on the insured and self-insured one below. \nJeff Alter: Yes. \nOperator: We will take our final question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nSheryl Skolnick: There have been a couple of criticisms of late which I think your quarter results -- congratulations to everyone. It kind of puts it that, but I'm going to ask this question anyway, because it comes up from time to time. So obviously, it's not possible for UnitedHealthcare to win all of this business on its merits but rather, it must be under pricing and therefore, must be crushing its margin. So in view of the fact that you didn't do that this quarter and it seems from your -- seemingly well-based enthusiasm for your momentum and the strength of your business and customer relationships that you're unlikely to crush your margins off the new business in the several coming quarters. How much of this new business win is actually related to the -- and also, the ability to preserve margins, especially within UHC is ability to the -- is attributable to the integration of all of the business units, not just in OptumCare, within OptumHealth or not just the UHC, with OptumInsight but all of it together. So I'm asking the same question I asked basically in the third quarter of 2011 and 2012 and beyond which is how much of your results is as a result of the transformation of United itself to a better, smarter integrated business with Optum and UnitedHealthcare, nevermind the transformation of the marketplace? \nStephen Hemsley: Well, as usual, Sheryl, your questions almost don't need answers. We are a profoundly different value proposition. We are -- we try to bring value to the marketplace through a much more diversified proposition and that each year, gets more effective, more integrated, more mature. And I think that, as Dave said in his commentary, six or seven years of steady growth in the UnitedHealthcare business, the growth across all of the platforms. It is a different proposition and I think that's -- really just sums it up. I won't go further than that. And again, we just have to prove that every quarter, in terms of our own performance, our execution, the consistency of our growth and the consistency of our financial performance, as we continue to grow and expand the business and they are still a lot of opportunity.  We are far from our full potential and generally, when we conclude these sessions with you, we have an internal meeting talking about how much better we should be doing and could be doing if we performed to full potential. So we are going to continue on that path and pleased to perform consistently this quarter. Expect to do it into the finish of the year. Have a positive attitude on 2017 and we're just going to keep working on that level so that, I think, it's a good way to close out the call. So we thank you for the conversation today. I think we've delivered a strong third quarter. We reported solid growth in virtually every business across both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We are going to leverage this forward momentum and expect to close 2016 with a real energy and drive strong and sustained performance into 2017. We will continue to elevate the quality of our service. I think that's really important for us. We are very focused on NPS and quality performance to bring that to customers and to bring it to providers, improve the healthcare experience for consumers and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Our Investor Conference in November is just a few weeks away and we have held back a number of things this morning so that we can have a robust conversation with you in November. And we look forward to that. So thank you for your participation this morning. \nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 2, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-07-19 15:17:18", "content": "Executives: Stephen J.

I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to UnitedHealth Group's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports and SEC Filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 19, 2016, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our company's second quarter performance. For our full year 2016, both UnitedHealthcare and Optum continue to grow at a vibrant pace. The outlook for net earnings, cash flows and return on capital remain strong and consistent with our recent commentary. The steady advancement of innovative, market-responsive products, services and experiences has led to balanced organic gains across virtually all of our businesses. We believe our businesses remain well-positioned for continued broad-based growth for the balance of 2016, for 2017 and in the years to come. As we reflect on this quarter's performance, we once again see exceptional growth, improved customer retention, and important new business awards and opportunities, leading to continued advances in both revenue backlog and sales pipelines. For second quarter 2016, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 28.2% year-over-year to $46.5 billion, with all domestic lines posting double-digit growth, as we grew to serve 132 million unique individuals. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.96 per share grew 13.3% year-over-year. Medical cost trends remain steady and consistent with the outlook we shared as we began the year, and operating costs remain well-controlled. Last quarter, we updated you on our intent in 2017 to participate in only a handful of ACA-compliant individual markets, what we referred to as the exchange market. That effort is on track, and we do not expect any meaningful financial exposure on 2017 business from the three or fewer exchange markets where we currently plan to remain. Our second quarter includes an incremental $200 million in full year 2016 exchange market losses fully absorbed in these results. Along with what we absorbed last quarter, first half 2016 results reflect an incremental $325 million in full year losses beyond the expectation established as we entered the year. Looking at the company overall, we intend to carry strong 2016 business momentum into 2017 that will include investing in and improving our competitiveness for the years beyond 2017. We will balance these investments with our commitment to provide returns to shareholders through growth in earnings per share and dividends. We will lay out a strongly positive and detailed view of 2017 later this year and address questions at that time. We'll now turn the call to Larry Renfro to discuss Optum's strong second quarter performance, then Dave Wichmann will cover UnitedHealthcare and the UnitedHealth Group overall. Larry?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Optum's second quarter results continued to build on the exceptional growth trends, earning results and operating performance metrics we have achieved for the last several years. Second quarter revenues exceeded $20 billion, increasing 52% over last year. OptumRx revenues expanded 69% to $15.1 billion. OptumHealth and OptumInsight combined grew their top line to $5.8 billion, growth of 20% over last year. Optum earned more than $1.2 billion in the second quarter with all segments reporting earnings growth of 20% or more. First half 2016 earnings from operations exceeded $2.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first half 2015, an increase of 47%. As expected, first half 2016 earnings results represent just over 40% of Optum's full year outlook. OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 15% or $1.5 billion to $7.3 billion, with growth particularly strong in revenue management, technology and government services. OptumHealth grew to over 80 million consumers, up 6% over last year, while OptumRx is tracking well to its target of managing 1 billion adjusted scripts this year. The pipeline of opportunities we are discussing with existing and prospective customers are increasingly more strategic. We are being asked to help fundamentally change and improve core business operations, rather than simply respond to traditional RFPs or single-point solutions. Today the average award size for OptumHealth and OptumInsight is more than double what it was just a few years ago. And Optum's qualified sales pipeline continues to grow strongly in both opportunity size and quality. Last quarter, we discussed with you, in some detail, our vision for the next-generation pharmacy care services business. So far this year, OptumRx has been honored to receive new external business awards for January 2017, covering more than 1.7 million people, an increase of 40% over last year's sales result at this point in the year and the selling season continues. Sophisticated buyers are embracing our modern and innovative approaches to data and proprietary analytics, consumer engagement and service, specialty pharmacy and clinical programs that integrate to improve overall patient health. A second high potential area is the health financial services market. Independent estimates project market growth of more than 20% per year, as the number of people using health benefit accounts expands and their account balances increase. Optum's health financial services business aligns with the company's efforts to help consumers navigate and use the entire healthcare system more effectively. Optum Financial Services serves consumers through 3 million health financial accounts with approximately $7 billion in assets under management by year end 2016. And there are expanding opportunities in this area and others to simplify the consumer health care experience, incent prevention and wellness, and provide consumers with deeper insights and more control, as they seek to optimize their personal health and manage their health-related finances throughout their lives. The consistent theme in these examples and in Optum's performance quarter-by-quarter is that customers are embracing Optum's innovative approaches to making health care work better. We bring the market four things: seasoned people; experienced operators committing to helping solve our clients' complex challenges; proven technology, specifically technology-enabled solutions and tools to power clients' processes and operations; unique data assets and analytics, we help clients gain insights to make better decisions and take better actions on multiple levels; action and results. We have the flexibility and focus to respond quickly and execute our task accurately for those we serve. Optum is uniquely positioned to serve as a valuable data-enabled health services company in a growing $1 trillion global marketplace, a company serving all stakeholders across the health care system: consumers, health plans, life science companies, governments, employers and health care providers. Now, let me turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Scott Wichmann - President: Thank you, Larry. Broad, diversified growth and strong forward momentum also continued at UnitedHealthcare again this quarter. UnitedHealthcare is passionate about modernizing and enriching the consumer experience and continues to advance new approaches to simplify that experience for the people we serve. Second quarter Medicare & Retirement revenues grew nearly 14% to $14.3 billion. Strong retention and growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement yielded net growth of nearly 0.5 million people year-to-date. Growth in Medicare is being driven by dependable products that offer clear value and serve people in simple and caring ways. For instance, while seniors are on the phone with us for other reasons, we will encourage and schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors' appointments for them this year. Home visits by our house call nurses will be up 20% year-over-year to over 1.2 million in 2016. Activities such as these, along with consistent approaches around benefits, products, network engagement and tailored service meaningfully improve care quality, the consumer experience and customer retention. From these and other activities, we expect to serve a significantly higher percentage of our Medicare Advantage members through four-star plans in 2017. This was a big lift by our people and care delivery partners. And I am grateful to all of them for what they have achieved on behalf of those we serve. Strong organic growth continues in Medicaid as well, with revenues up 14.7% to $8.3 billion as UnitedHealthcare community and state served 225,000 more people in the second quarter. This past quarter's growth includes new members in Iowa and expanded services in New York. And we were awarded additional markets in Pennsylvania for next year, as part of that state's program expansion. Importantly, Medicaid revenue growth also reflects a stronger mix as states continue to ask us to help them serve more people with more complex healthcare needs. We now serve nearly 5.7 million people through state-sponsored health care programs, and we expect that growth to continue as we advance innovations to help states better serve their most complex and higher-cost citizens, meeting their needs with more integrated social services built around their health. Our Employer & Individual business revenues also grew 14% to $13.5 billion in the second quarter. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve nearly 400,000 more people in commercial benefits through the first six months of the year outside of the exchange market products. This is strongly favorable to the initial growth forecasts for both self-funded and full-risk offerings. Turning to medical costs, we reported a care ratio of 82% this quarter, which is 30 basis points year-over-year \u2013 a 30 basis point year-over-year increase, primarily due to adverse exchange market performance and the relative levels of claim reserve development in the quarter, offset by strong underlying core performance by the rest of our UnitedHealthcare businesses. Year-to-date, favorable prior-year reserve development was $300 million as compared to $130 million in the first half of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, reserves developed unfavorably by $100 million. Of this, $60 million relates to items that predate 2016 and do not impact 2016 core medical trends, such as 2013 and 2014 Medicaid and Medicare true-ups and settlements. The current year portion of development relates to exchange market products. Beyond this component, the current year development in the second quarter was favorable. Commercial medical trend remains consistent with the original outlook of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Hospital inpatient admissions per person are lower year-over-year across all UnitedHealthcare businesses. Like most years, there are pockets of higher cost trends, including specialty pharmacy and the increasing use of ER and outpatient services this year. Overall, health care cost trends remain in line and controlled. Bringing these items together, in the second quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues by $4.5 billion or 13.6% on a year-over-year basis. The business grew by 320,000 domestic consumers in the quarter and has added more than 1.6 million consumers year-to-date. UnitedHealthcare generated nearly $2 billion in operating earnings in the quarter despite the pressures from exchange market products and the second-quarter prior-year reserve development we just described. Stepping back, UnitedHealthcare has delivered steady, distinguished organic growth consistently for more than half a decade, and here's how we're doing it. We help people achieve better health by using our data and analytics to simplify decision-making and to help them access the care they need. We work with physicians and hospitals, sharing information to help them make fact-based decisions about the care they provide. And we focus every day on improving the quality of our execution in every interaction and process for the people we engage with and serve, as well as those who provide their care. UnitedHealthcare, still with only a modest national share in a growing health care benefits market, expects to drive further growth by delivering on these commitments better and better every day, every quarter and every year. Moving to UnitedHealth Group as a whole, cash flows from operations in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or about 1 times net income compared to 0.7 times net income in the year-ago period. Year to date, cash flow from operations of $4 billion was 1.2 times net income, also ahead of last year's pace. The company repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the first half of 2016. Our Board of Directors increased the dividend in June by 25% to an annual rate of $2.50 per share. We will return nearly $2.4 billion to shareholders in dividends payments in the next 12 months. The debt-to-total-capital ratio declined to 48%, and we expect it will continue to decline in the second half of this year, as we work back to a target in the 40% range. Reflecting on performance for the first six months of 2016, overall growth and results have been favorable across the businesses. However, our exchange market growth is also above our original estimates, as are the corresponding losses. Prudently balancing this overall performance, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.80 to $7.95 from the former $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We believe this to be an appropriate posture, given the performance backdrop of the exchange business, even as the core businesses have performed strongly. As we consider the balance of 2016, we expect the combination of cost to set up new businesses for \u2013 new business for 2017 and ongoing investments in growth areas such as MedExpress, OptumCare and International, along with strong seasonal fourth quarter earnings performance from Optum, will produce approximately equal adjusted earnings per share results in each of the last two quarters of this year. Steve?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Dave. As we have discussed in recent conversations, we believe we are in the early stages of a unique era for UnitedHealth Group, looking ahead toward what may be the best and most important decade of performance for this enterprise. We serve growing markets that are seeking better performance in health care, both in the U.S. and globally. We continue to strengthen and align enterprise capabilities to meet these needs. And we are intensely focused on the quality and consistency of the experience we deliver to our consumers, customers, benefit sponsors and care providers. On this latter point, we have the opportunity to evolve and differentiate our enterprise in the coming years by focusing intensely on redefining the quality and value of the health care experience for those we serve, and importantly, objectively measuring the impact of these efforts and recalibrating and enhancing our performance as we advance. With this focus, paired with evolving capabilities and the strong market positions of our growing diversified portfolio of businesses, we expect to drive differentiated growth for years to come. These efforts will help people live healthier lives and make health systems work better for everyone. As a company, we're committed to making the most of this period of opportunity. We thank you for your interest today. And, operator, let's open up for some questions. One question per person, please. Thank you.\nOperator: Again, we ask you limit to one question per person, so we can get to as many participants as possible. We'll take the first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Could you just give us, sorry, maybe some visibility on how you're handling the Medicare Advantage bids for 2017? I know the information is not public yet, but if you can just talk to directionally how much of the ACA fee suspension you've loaded into benefits versus reserving for other internal initiatives or earnings?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I think our orientation is to really make sure that we are serving the interests of seniors. Steve, do you want to touch on that?\nSteven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement: Sure. Good morning, Matt. Steve Nelson.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning.\nSteven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement: Yes. So, as you pointed out, it is a bit early to provide any detail, but I can give you some high-level perspective and direction. We clearly want to build on the momentum that we're experiencing right now in 2016. So, our objective is to continue to offer stability in our benefits, including premiums. There will be some enhancements where we think that's appropriate. It's obviously a market-by-market conversation, but overall, stability in both benefits and premiums. And this is driven in large part by the great improvement that we've been experiencing in our Star performance, particularly for 2017. And then we're going to continue on the innovations around the member experience for clinical programs. And we think this well positions us for growth in both the individual and the group Medicare Advantage products, and particularly, in the group side, experiencing really strong sales and retention for 2017.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Just \u2013 sorry, go ahead.\nSteven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement: With respect to the insurance fee and as a moratorium there, I think it's important to think about that in the context of the overall funding equation. As you know, this program has been underfunded, 14% rate cut since 2010 and continues to be underfunded relative to medical costs. So, our goal, as Steve mentioned, is to provide stability and valuable benefits to the seniors. And it's a very effective program that continues to drive costs down and improve outcomes, and satisfaction is really high. So our perspective and our approach has been, after we take this into the overall funding equation, we're going to share a portion of it, obviously, with the provider partners and employer groups in the group MA space, and then passing on a meaningful amount to our members in the form of stable benefits, and again, enhancing where we can. So, I think, that provides a perspective. And again, we're just \u2013 we're really feeling great about the position of this business and the opportunities as we head into 2017 and beyond.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And it's a great question, but it's just a little early in terms of going too far into it, so...\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Can I just one follow-up? Okay, never mind. I know you got a lot of people. Go ahead.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we can cover these off-line, Matt, through the course of the day.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right, yeah.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: Go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the exchanges. Two things here. One, I know you're broadly exiting, but wanted to get more detail on what happened here in terms of a postmortem. Maybe Dan can walk us through how the initial $400 million of losses was set when you originally realized the problem for 2016, and what the company has seen to \u2013 that has driven the loss to be about double that over the last six months or so? And then just lastly, you're running more than $500 million of losses, give or take, in this segment for 2016 in terms of what you've reported for this year. Can we simply add that number back to the 2016 reported earnings to get the true run rate to jump off for 2017 for Steve's strong earnings number for next year, or are there some other adjustments we need to think about? Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, Dan, do you want to take him through the math?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Sure. Good morning, Justin.\nJustin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Good morning.\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: The question was comprehensive. So, just to re-baseline on the individual ACA. Our expectation coming into the year was that on a policy-year basis, we would lose somewhere in the area of $525 million. We had done a premium deficiency reserve at the end of the year of $245 million to partially offset that. So, the net of those two was about a $280 million impact to 2016 earnings performance. And then in the first quarter, we strengthened that or increased the loss expectation by $125 million, and then likewise, added an additional $200 million in the second quarter fully recognized in the quarter in terms of the expectation of the full year. So, when you put that all together, it's a shade over $600 million of P&L impact to 2016. As you look at what's driving the increase inside that, so for the quarter, the $200 million that we've added, it's a combination of two things. It's really more volume and higher consumption. And I'd break it down, about a third of that is higher volume. So, we've got higher sales as well as more moderate attrition than we had expected. And then two-thirds is really around the consumption. And, obviously, we had unfavorable development on our exchanges relating to the first quarter in the second quarter. That came with higher second quarter costs, and we've also let that inform our full year outlook. So, two-thirds of that $200 million really relates to the underlying consumption. And what's changing underneath that, to your question, the reality is the severity of chronic conditions inside the population actually increased on a year-over-year basis. If you look at the prevalence of chronic disease, things like HIV and Hepatitis C, diabetes, COPD. Those are examples of things that the prevalence was high to begin with in 2015, and that has increased into 2016. So, that's what's informing our view. As you think about 2017, I would tell you, of that $605 million on the math I went through previously, a good meaningful portion of that will contribute to our 2017 performance. Some of the things offsetting that are certainly some semi-variable and fixed costs associated with this business that don't go away as we shrink our footprint in 2017.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan. That's, I think, a great response. So next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to comments around the negative prior-year development. You mentioned that it was driven in part by Medicare and Medicaid settlements related to 2013 and 2014. What is that, exactly? And it seems like an unusually long lag time for a true-up, so if you could just talk us through that.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Dan, do you want to touch on that?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Sure. Good morning, Sarah. Well, first and foremost, I'd tell you that there are certainly a lot of inherent estimates in our business, and as a result, there's lots of pluses and minuses in any given quarter, so when you look at the portfolio of things that resolve in a given quarter, there are always some things that change period to period. As it relates to second quarter, as Dave mentioned, we experienced $100 million of unfavorable reserve development, and that was split 60% on the prior year, and 40% on the current year. As you look at that prior-year element, there isn't anything individually large. There's a collection of things. And I'd tell you, that was a blend of some old provider settlements as well as, as Dave mentioned, some government true-ups, some of them dating back three years, particularly around Part D as you resolve the intersection between claims and corridors and reinsurance, and programs inside that. So, those are the things that contributed to that prior-year element. Importantly, though, those are all things that frankly don't have any bearing on our current year medical trend and medical outlook. And as it relates to the current year component, that obviously \u2013 with more than all of that was related to the individual ACA book of business. Absent that, we actually had favorable development related to the current year in the quarter. But important when you put it all together, from a medical cost perspective as well as a trend perspective, outside of the individual ACA, we continue to track in line with our expectations across the platform.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And some of it has to relate to how long it takes for the benefit sponsors and the administrations to actually get the final data, so you can actually get resolution.\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Absolutely.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. First, just quick question is just on the exchange update. Where did you end up in terms of exchange lives in 2Q, and what does your updated loss forecast assume in terms of attrition for the rest of the year? And then just a second follow-up question, just on OptumRx, looks like you're actually annualizing now to over $60 billion of revenue annualized in the first half. So, how are you thinking about the full year revenue guidance? I think, most recently it was at $58 billion, but it seems like you're \u2013 or at least annualizing well ahead of that so far in the first half of the year. Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So that's an interesting two-part combination. So, Dan, do you want to take the first part?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Sure, Scott. On the exchange enrollment, we ended the quarter with 820,000 lives in the exchange, so that's up about 25,000 from what we expected \u2013 or from what we ended the first quarter at. As we look to where we expect to perform over the balance of the year, we expect that to moderate through attrition and land somewhere in the zone of about 750,000 lives, as we close the year out. And then, obviously, with the \u2013 2017, we would expect a very meaningful reduction in that.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And OptumRx?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Scott, it's Larry Renfro. I'm going to start, and then I'm going to ask Tami Reller. Tami is the new CFO at Optum, and she's going to make a couple of comments here. So, I'm just going to talk a little bit about the Rx business for a second. We've been in business with Catamaran for about a year right now. And when we did that \u2013 we had a lot of reasons we did the business, and a couple of them, I thought, might be important to call out in regard to your question. And one was around the complementary strengths that we had. And that was the retail and the mail focus, and those business coming together as well as payers and employers coming together. But probably the most complementary was the technology, and we've been able to get that put that in place. The value proposition, and that's what I think you're starting to see now, the expanded services, the scale, as well as synchronization is starting to take hold, and it's resonating in the industry. So, we believe we're building a sound business, and you know how that works. So, we've had a good first half. We have hit all the metrics and are set up pretty well for the second half. And so, I'll let Tami comment on that.\nTami L. Reller - Chief Financial Officer, Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: That's great. Good. And I would just reiterate that integration is going well, new business is going well, renewals, all going very well, so we appreciate the question on the business. The one thing I would just note, too, is that we had a number of items that we noted in the December investor conference on elements that would affect both revenue and \u2013 as well as scripts, and that has to do with Part D enrollment, as well as one of our large clients moving to an administrative-only relationship and then also the well-known co-op closures. So, some of those elements do have an impact as we go forward throughout the year, but again, remain confident in the OptumRx business overall for the year.\nScott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Go next to A. J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.\nA. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hello, everybody. I think I'll just ask broadly about capital deployment from here. Obviously, you're coming up on the anniversary of the Catamaran deal, where you step back from the share buyback activity, been running about $500 million a quarter, which is less than previous. At what point do you think you might step that back up? And then also, just on general acquisitions and opportunities for transactions there, can you give us any thoughts on the availability of deals, and your thoughts about where you're focused?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think we'll address the capital allocation, but I would not get your hopes up that we're going to give you too much guidance about where we're focused, things like that, I think, as you might suspect. So, John, do you want to cover capital?\nJohn Franklin Rex - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Good morning, A. J. It's John Rex here. So, just thinking about \u2013 ways to answer your question here. So, yeah, we've repurchased about 1 billion shares \u2013 about $1 billion worth of stock year to date. That's against the guidance we had for $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So, you should expect that the repurchasing activity will moderate meaningfully in the second half of the year. And Dave had a bit commented in his portion of the script, we're also committed to continuing to bring down our debt-to-total-capital ratio back ultimately to our approximately 40% target range. So, we're just slightly below 48% here, as we exited the Q2. And so we'd expect to continue to focus on meeting those commitments and bringing down that debt-to-capital ratio. So, that's how you kind of think about it in terms of progression and capital.\nA. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And as it relates to M&A, I mean, we have a clear business model. We continue to be focused on building that out. We talked in the past about allocating capital to cultivate capabilities that we think are important for the future. And we tend to be careful with respect to how we consider our timing and values. So, I don't think any of those things that had been long-standing attributes really changed. And so, we'll \u2013 we continue to be attentive to the marketplace, but beyond that, I don't think we can give you much. Next question, please.\nOperator: We go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: It's going to be kind of a broad question, but I'm curious about what you're seeing going on with drug price trend going on now. If we look at your bids, you've won some business with OptumRx, some very sizable accounts, including one where your pricing shows up in publicly filed information, where you can see that your view on trend is a little bit below where some of the competitors are by 0.5% or 1.5%. So, can you tell us what you think is going on with drug price trend and with the various regulation that's coming out or that might come out on drug pricing? And where do you see all that evolving going forward over the next year or two?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we'll comment from a PBM point of view, and then maybe broadly in terms of the pressure on elevating drug prices broadly, particularly, in the specialty categories. Mark?\nMark A. Thierer - Chief Executive Officer, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Good morning, Peter. Well, drug prices are the first item, obviously, on our clients' list. And, I think, if you look at how we're attacking this, this last quarter has been a real differentiator for us. As Larry said, the combination here for us was all about scale. And it is intended to take to the supply chain. So, as a much bigger business, we're talking about drug pricing every day to the biotech companies and to the pharmaceutical companies bringing product to the market. And the way we contract with them is to protect our clients as best we can from some of these price increases. Obviously, price can be addressed by regulatory issues, but also just by better management of the drug benefits. So, we use our tools like formulary, like specialty steerage, like preferred and exclusionary networks, to drive price down. And in large part, this is what's defining us right now. We've reached a scale where we've obviously taken the drug spend that we manage for our clients to the supply chain and a differentiated model to drive down and contain to the best of our ability drug prices. And so rather than talk on a political stage about how to get after drug pricing, we're using the tools that we've deployed here and integrating them with better medical management in the broader Optum chassis. So, we do think we have a differentiated model, a better way to get after drug price and drug cost management, combining both the technology platform that Larry talked about and, really, the leading clinical management platform in the broader Optum. So, that's what we're doing.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please?\nOperator: Next question is from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAndy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. So, maybe if you could discuss a little bit more how you see the Medicaid pipeline opportunity, involving both near term and longer term, maybe even including the Pennsylvania and LTSS RFP. Dave in his prepared remarks said he expect to grow, so what's giving you confidence about your ability to continue to win RFPs going forward? And then just real quick, how are Iowa costs running versus the losses assumed in the PVR? Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Austin?\nAustin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Thanks for the question. First of all, as far as the pipeline, I think we've mentioned a couple of times earlier in the year, we see very robust pipeline. We expect to respond to about 20 RFPs this year that'll be implemented over the next three years. Many of those, and I think this is a really important piece, continue to include, and Dave mentioned this in his comments, more and more populations with complex needs. That gives us an awful lot of confidence, because when you look at the combined capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that really is in our wheelhouse. That's really where we can provide tremendous amount of value to the consumer as well as our state partners. So, we see that continuing. The Pennsylvania LTSS opportunity is just one example of that. We'll see Virginia as another example of that, Oklahoma another example, so you're going to see a continued increase in these very costly populations. Keep in mind when you back up and look at the macro story here, you've got $500 billion of spend in the Medicaid space. You got about 70% of the membership in managed care today, but only about 41% of the dollars. So, when you talk about confidence in the pipeline and opportunity to grow, that's really where that opportunity sits. Couple with that still some greenfield states. There are 15 states that don't have managed care today, some very large, like North Carolina, where we've been successful in working with the state to get legislation passed, and that market will continue to develop. So, again, I think, it squares up very nicely with our capabilities and marks the road for a very good growth opportunity going forward. In regard to Iowa, first and foremost, we're very pleased with the implementation. It's been going very well. We stay very focused on job one, which is taking care of the folks we've been entrusted to do so. And we did build a very good relationship with the state. As you know, it's \u2013 we're one quarter in, so it's very early, so too early to really comment on what we're seeing. Early indications would be that it's in line with our expectations, but, again, very early.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Next?\nOperator: And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line's open.\nChris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning. Just was hoping to get some more clarification on Dave's comments about the drivers of medical cost trend. I guess, just generally, when you made your comments about specialty pharma, ER and outpatient and then inpatient, is that inclusive of the ACA exchange membership? And then more importantly, is it fair to say that the specialty pharma, emergency room, outpatient are trending higher than you initially expected, and that's being offset by inpatient? Or just any comment would be helpful. Thanks a lot.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Dan?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Good morning, Chris. Dan Schumacher. So, first and foremost, just as a reminder, coming into the year, our expectation was for a moderate increase in underlying utilization trend. That's what informed our pricing, our entire benefit planning as well as the guidance we've provided. And that's what we were able to manage to in the second quarter, very consistent with our conversation in the first quarter and very much in line with our expectation. It's kind of looking at how trends progress through the year. Typically, we talk in annual terms. But as we look to the quarters, we certainly don't view Q2 use as having accelerated beyond the Q1 rate. If anything, I'd probably tell you that Q2 is perhaps a little bit lower. To your questions about the categories themselves, the bigger drivers of our trend are certainly in pharmacy and outpatient, as Dave mentioned, and then working against that is more moderate levels of trend, as we drive down per capita use on an inpatient basis. The pharmacy piece, I will tell you that's largely driven by Hepatitis C. So, we changed our coverage criteria effective 1/1 of 2016 in our commercial business, so we expanded coverage. And that's what's really driving that 8% to 9% pharmacy trend on a commercial basis that we talked about back at the investor conference. And then if you look to the outpatient side, inside there, we see elevated levels of emergency room. Surgical procedures are contributing, also facility-based \u2013 facility-dispensed prescriptions, so that's kind of oriented more around the oncology space. So, those are some of the bigger contributors, and not surprisingly, that is absolutely where our medical management efforts are focused to work down those costs. All of those categories, I will tell you, are within the ranges that we expressed at the investor conference, probably a little bit higher on the outpatient side, in line in the pharmacy space, a little bit better on the inpatient side, but net-net, we still expect, on a commercial basis, our full year medical trend to be in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.\nChris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. Thanks a lot.\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: You bet.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please?\nOperator: And we'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nMichael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. So, Larry, I was wondering if you could update us on what you're seeing in terms of Optum opportunities on the international front?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Well, that's a good question. I'll start with probably the area that we're spending a lot of time in, and that's the U.K., and what's going on with the U.K. I'm going to ask Jeff Berkowitz, who runs that area, to follow up my comments. But \u2013 and we've talked about this in the past. We've been \u2013 we've been in the U.K. for about 10 years or so, but the past year we have put a lot of time and effort into the development of our products there. I would say that regardless of the political situation, the challenges, the opportunities, everything that we have been trying to address, nothing has changed. And we feel that the past year, we've been able to establish ourselves in a capacity that people now understand the Optum products. They understand our direction and what we're trying to achieve. So, we remain bullish with some caution around what's going to go on, on the political side. Jeff?\nJeffrey Berkowitz - Executive Vice President, Optum, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: So, Larry, just as you said, we've spent the past years in the U.K. establishing a very strong foundation. We have a strong foundation with the National Health system, a strong foundation with the National Health system improvement, and a very strong foundation of work on the ground with the Department of Health. And even with Brexit, Optum's foundation stands \u2013 continues to stand strong. And while we don't yet know all the ways Brexit will play out, as Larry just said, in the coming months and years, we do believe that the health service right now will continue to drive its existing plans related to our own efforts there. And we will continue to work closely with England's Department of Health and the NHS to help them achieve those important missions.\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: So, Michael, it's Larry again. I would comment on Brazil that we are working with Amil in bringing our technologies, our services to that part of the world. And that's going pretty well. And there are other development countries that are too early for us to talk about. But as we talked about back at the Investor Day, we believe this is about a $500 billion market, so we're going to stay and be part of it.\nMichael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for the update.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please?\nOperator: Next we'll go to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nSheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you. And first, I would be remiss if I didn't say congratulations to John, and David, and Tami on their new roles, well-deserved and lovely to see. And with that, can we focus on something that's important, but I'm not sure we actually got a whole lot of detail around this? OptumRx has clearly done a very good job of winning competitive business and not based solely on price, or not even importantly on price, but rather on what appears to be an innovative and intriguing combination of services and capabilities as well as scale. But implementation is going to be important, so \u2013 and I gathered from your commentary around guidance that you plan to spend to implement, which is great. But can you give us some more details about what you plan to do to ensure that these new lives as well as the existing lives, as seamless an experience becoming OptumRx beneficiaries as did the 11 million commercial lives, which you clearly were able to bring on without even a whisper of an issue? That would be very helpful. And with some estimate of what it will impact presumably in third and fourth quarter. Thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So I think that's an excellent area of interest. So...\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: I'll start.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yup.\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: So, Sheryl, it's Larry. I'm going to ask Mark to comment after I finish. So, I know, you know that we have certain priorities that we work toward in Optum, and one of them is to establish, what I'll call, these deeper, more comprehensive relationships. I think we had a goal to have about 8 to 10 of them by the end of 2016. I think, we're pushing 17 right now. And these last wins were part of that. So, as part of going after that effort a few years ago, we have been strengthening leadership ever since that started. So, we feel very, very confident in the leadership that we have, and that we have developed as well as with the combination of Catamaran and OptumRx, we're pretty solid when it comes to that. When you step over into implementation and execution, that happens to also be one of our key priorities that we pride ourself on. So, this is not really out of the ordinary, what we do. So, we looked at both of those things from an execution standpoint as well as from a people standpoint, and so the third question you asked is about the monetary side of this, and it's built in. So, there should not be any impact at all to guidance. We expect to get these type of relationships, and we have built it in the plan. So, there shouldn't be anything extraordinary that would happen from a financial standpoint. Mark?\nMark A. Thierer - Chief Executive Officer, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Yes, Sheryl. Good morning, and, Larry, thank you. So, I think, I'd like to just take a moment and talk about what broadly large-scale buyers want and need. And we are feeling very good about the fact that our message is resonating, and we posted some substantial wins here recently, and it's not by accident. Large buyers have a set of complicated needs but, first and foremost, they need a flexible and proven technology partner and engine to drive their PBM benefit. They obviously need market-clearing economics and prices \u2013 price matters. But our model of providing superior service and really focusing on quality and then marrying our data analytics and our synchronization capability, these are really the reasons that our message is resonating. And then finally, if someone's going to make a bet on a big transition, you have to have a track record of executing on large-scale conversions or transitions. And this combined business has that. As you know, there was a very large-scale transition several years ago in OptumRx. And in our prior business at Catamaran, we had bought and integrated eight companies. And so, the notion of a heavy lift and making large-scale implementations happen is something that we know how to do. So, we're feeling really good about the balance of the year and the work plan in place to implement these flawlessly. If you look back on our 1/1/16, where we also had a good number of new client wins, we got great channel checks on our implementation work, because that's the heart and soul of this business. You have to do well. It all starts with a successful implementation, and we do know what to do. So, thanks for the question.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. We only have a few more minutes, so a couple more questions. So, the next one, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.\nFrank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning. One of the areas of growth you called out in OptumHealth, one of those drivers was expansion of behavioral services into new Medicaid markets. You called that on the press release. I'm curious. Could you elaborate on that a little bit more on that particular growth opportunity, how sustainable is it, and how much did it contribute to this 15% growth in that segment? Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Mike?\nMichael Weissel - Executive Vice President, Optum Consumer Solutions, UnitedHealth Group, Inc: Sure. So, this is Mike Weissel. Thanks for the question. I think, when we look at behavioral health and we look at the Medicaid market, in particular, we see a number of opportunities. I think, we see them both in combination with UnitedHealthcare, as Austin mentioned earlier, in the areas of the long-term social services or IDD population. Those populations continue to kind of be driven into managed care in some way with the behavioral piece. So, we see plenty of opportunity there. There are also other states, which are looking to do that on a direct basis. And so, we compete on a regular basis and have a robust pipeline today, specifically, in the direct market with some of these states as they look to build it. So, we see that as a continuing growth opportunity for us.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the continued integration of behavioral health in the mainstream clinical?\nAustin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: I just would comment. This is Austin Pittman. So, Mike mentioned this, but the work we continue to do to really integrate our behavioral health with our physical health really creating a new model that we're calling whole-person health is really an exciting new direction for us. It certainly will bode well for UnitedHealthcare and Optum's growth on that piece of business, as well as that external business. In fact, you could probably think of it with a lot of the same attributes that were just discussed around OptumRx, integrating and synchronizing network with our full clinical model. Same thing applies here. It's a really exciting next step for us.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And it's not limited to Medicaid.\nAustin T. Pittman - Chief Executive Officer, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: No.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's broad-based. Next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChristine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, there. You spoke to the backlog growth which looks really nice in OptumInsight. Could you speak to where you see major opportunities and kind of the composition maybe of the opportunities that you're seeing there?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, maybe just in broad strokes, though. Larry?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: So I'll start and \u2013 I'll start. And it's Larry, Christine. So I'll get going here, and I'm going to ask Bill Miller to come in on this as well. So, when \u2013 we look at all of our indicators, and all are in line with what we are expecting. In three of the \u2013 what I call the top metrics that we engage with to see how the growth is going. One would be our qualified sales pipeline, and I brought that up a few minutes ago in the script. And I'll just tell you that from an overall year-over-year standpoint, our qualified sales pipeline, which is a very diverse pipeline, is double the size of what it was this time last year. Obviously, number two is that backlog that we were talking about, where we're up the 15%. That $11.3 billion, obviously, that's another key indicator. And I think the third one is even a stronger one, and that's our \u2013 what I'll call, our closed sales. And how we look at the total contract value on that. And we're up 80% at the end of the second quarter. And that 80% is going against the entire year of 2015. So, I'm doing an 80% above on contracted \u2013 total contracted revenue for Optum, 80% above what was done an entire year of 2015. So, obviously, the sales pipeline, the closed sales and the backlog, that's going give us a jumpstart into 2017. So, we're feeling very good about where we stand right now. But I might just ask Bill to comment on some of the things that he's actually got going on inside some of these different metrics I'm talking about.\nBill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Christine. Yeah, as Larry said, there's a lot of confidence if you interrogate that backlog and that prevailing confidence comes from \u2013 if you even look at Q1 and Q2, they were marked by some of the largest software deals we've done. Those are piled into the backlog. We see more of that coming down the pipe in the future. Number two, if you just look at the velocity, the sheer numbers, the size of it, as Larry noted. It is at breakneck pace. And then third, if you kind of look at the nature and the demographics of that, just our activity in the pipeline, in general, we are the recipients of more RFPs than we've ever been. We are engaging in strategic conversations with more constituencies at a faster pace than we ever had, and that includes health providers, health plans, governments, employers and certainly, pharma. And then also, I would think the interesting part about it is the comprehensive nature of the \u2013 many of the opportunities in that pipeline. They're very big, they're long in their duration, and they are really aligned with what we've always expressed in terms of these deeper and more comprehensive relationships. And there is a fair amount of it that's marked by analytics, too. That's a growth market for us. If you look at the demographics in there, and you look at kind of the way we set up in the analytics market, it's clear that we're going to see growth there. The pipeline reflects that. And I think we have distinguished ourselves very well on the analytics front, on the revenue managed front, payment integrity. So, it's a very diverse sort of boundary-less pipeline that I think bodes well for the rest of the year and certainly into 2017.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: But to your point, that's a long lead time and could be uncertain \u2013 unclear in times of time frames, right?\nBill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Yes.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just challenging to manage that. So, great question. Next question, please? So we'll take two more, and then we'll cut it off. And John and Brent and others will be around for the balance of the day.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nAna A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to get some more color on your comments on the capital deployment towards OptumCare. You've mentioned that is a focus area and MedExpress. In context of these trends that we continue to see on outpatient mix shifting and ER, and then most recently with the administration making all these changes, not the least of which is macro, I was wondering if you have an increased appetite at this time to buy primary care docs? And are you seeing more willingness for them to affiliate with you relative to the hospital? And then the second part of that was what about ambulatory surgery centers, given that seems to be a big trend in terms of elective surgeries and procedures?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, we'll go another 10 minutes responding to that question.\nDavid Scott Wichmann - President: Ana, it's Dave Wichmann. Maybe just to extend on the capital deployment front, and then if Larry or Jack want to comment as well, please feel free to do so. I think John Rex in his new role as CFO did a great job responding to our overall capital priorities, but I think it has been consistent over time. We have allocated about 50% of our capital to growth and about 50% of our capital to returning to shareholders. And you can see that is strongly biased towards the dividend right now, as we seek to also pay down our debt and get our leverage ratio down to 40%. The 50% on M&A we really didn't touch on a whole lot, and our priorities remain pretty consistent as they have been. As you can see, we've been investing significantly into Optum. And you can see the returns of that, which have been extensive. I think, the team has done a fantastic job of driving nice returns on the invested capital basis that we put in place there. Two of those areas were the MedExpress platform, which is the urgent care platform, which supports the notion of us providing better quality, more consumer-responsive and higher-value care, and in this case happens to be in the ambulatory setting. We said that, that was a foundational investment in MedExpress. And I think, as you knew at the time, we would continue to invest into opening new locations in that business over time. And as you can imagine, with de novo startups, they tend to create a little bit of a drag on earnings, particularly, as you're just getting going in the early stages of that. Your instincts are right, and they kind of tie into the trend conversation that Dan discussed as well, which is we're seeing a higher utilization of ER. And, of course, the care setting and the urgent care, we believe, is much more effective and will help to obviate costs not only for UnitedHealthcare but across all the payers that Optum serves. Another area of priority for us is to continue to invest in the OptumCare business. Larry laid out quite nicely, I believe, the 75 markets that we want to pursue, which constitute about 80% of all health care. And one of the areas in which we're pursuing that is through the development of physician practices and services in those markets. And we have an initial foundation of that, I believe about $10 billion of revenue or so on a combined basis. We serve over 7 million patients, and we have a nice going business, I believe, in some stages of some 25-plus markets so far. And our activities there continue, and we'll continue to deploy capital in that area and continue to pursue the development of our business in that primary care setting. Larry, do you want to add?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Yeah, just a couple things. Today, we have about 175 MedExpress urgent care centers. And we have been doing about 30 start-ups a year. I think, we'll ramp that up 2017 to about 75. And then we probably have another additional 75 urgent care centers that were all part of the primary care businesses that we have, and we have acquired. So, as Dave said, this is one of our top growth pillars in terms of what we're trying to do for the future, and we're going to be focused on that. The other side of this is OptumCare, and I'll let Jack talk about that.\nJack Larsen - Executive Vice President, OptumCare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Thanks, Larry. Good morning, Ana. In the OptumCare Care Delivery business, we're certainly in the early innings of building this. To your question on receptivity, yes, we are seeing increased receptivity of some of the higher-quality physician groups, primarily organized around primary care to look not only to join us but really to do something different in terms of the way they care for their patients, really looking for the assistance coming out of care delivery, out of Bill Miller's business with OptumInsight, around population health tools and really re-equipping them to up their game to be more attractive to large-plan sponsors and large employers looking to contract with physicians in an altogether different way. So, we have been hard at work at that. And we continue to see good receptivity, and we're going to be at it for certainly the balance of 2016 and 2017. And I think, in one of your questions, you have preferred to MACRA, clearly game-changing when it comes to the world of physicians and providers. We're certainly evaluating the regulatory release, but we think it is really a stamp of approval of where we're taking physicians and getting them right in the thick of more comprehensive population health management.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think we can play at that level and can do it right from the start.\nAna A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks. Very helpful color.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Last question, please?\nOperator: And we'll take that question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in, guys. Steve, you mentioned some commentary around 2017 and an outlook coming a little bit later. So, I appreciate we're not going to get into the specifics here. But as you think about the comments you've made and then $2 billion of Optum revenues that we know about, Medicare Advantage, including the fee and group wins that you're seeing, the elimination of the exchanges which, that alone $0.37, $0.38 this year. That's like 5% of earnings. Are there any offsets, anything we should think about that's unusual in 2017 in terms of a headwind that would preclude you from getting into your long term 13% to 16% growth?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, the only ones you missed on the upside were the Stars, the increasing Stars performance and just the overall momentum of growth coming in. And then I think, the offset I would offer is, I think, you have to remain respectful of two things, and that is that our business has increasingly a large factor of federal and state programs, and those programs have funding dynamics to them. So, I think, those things always have to be taken into consideration and respected. And lastly, as we've talked through the course of the morning, kind of a never-ending respect for medical cost trends and particularly those we outlined this morning, making sure that we are addressing those effectively. And, I think, those two things are environmental but have to always be called out as elements for consideration. And as we indicated early, we are getting a lot of new business opportunities and successes, and making sure that we stand those up in a very effective and successful way and are meticulous with respect to that execution. Those are the things that I would say balance off in terms of making sure that we are living up to our responsibilities. So, that's the kind of outlook I would bring to it.\nJoshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we thank you. Just kind of in closing, UnitedHealth Group delivered, I think, a very strong second quarter. UnitedHealthcare and Optum's products and services continue to grow and resonate with consumers and customers. I think, our enterprise is well-positioned to address the changing healthcare needs of the people and markets we serve, and in doing so, we continue to have the momentum of broad-based growth that we're going to take through 2016 and 2017, and hopefully, the decade ahead. So, this concludes our call, and we thank you for your interest today. Thank you.\nOperator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 1, "year": 2016, "date": "2016-04-19 14:15:20", "content": "Executives: Stephen J.

Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 19, 2016, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley. Please go ahead.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to review our results for first quarter 2016. UnitedHealth Group businesses have steadily strengthened over the last several years and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2016. Our momentum is evident in the highest levels of customer and consumer retention in our history combined with new customer acquisitions driving strong revenue gains across the enterprise; growth in the size, scope and diversity of products and services within our client base as well as a number of new customer opportunities we are pursuing; steadily improving metrics for brand and reputation and steadily rising net promoter scores across our businesses. Customers buy value and expect results and we are sharpening our performance focus, driving the highest quality customer experiences, helping us become the go-to choice, a must-have partner for everyone looking to improve performance and sustainability in health benefits and health services. When we combine higher quality from consistent excellent execution with practical innovations at scale, our opportunities to grow and serve continue to expand. Our intensified commitments to quality performance and to growth on the strength of that quality positions UnitedHealth Group to look forward toward what we believe may become our best decade of performance and growth yet. Turning to the results, we are reporting today our first quarter revenues grew 9% prior to acquisitions and over 24% overall to $44.5 billion with broad strength across the enterprise. In health benefits, medical costs were well managed and controlled as is evident in the consolidated care ratio of 81.7%. Prior-year reserves developed favorably by $360 million in the quarter; the medical days claims payable increased four days year over year to 51 days. Cash flows of $2.3 billion or 1.4 times net income continued at a strong and reliable pace. First quarter's operating cost ratio decreased 110 basis points year over year to 15.2% due to a combination of business mix, technology-driven operational efficiencies and the cumulative overall effects of revenue growth. These efficiency gains were partially offset by continued investments in our businesses. Our tax rate reflected early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation, adding roughly $0.06 per share in the quarter. You should expect it will add considerably less in coming quarters due to the natural pattern of equity-based compensation activity for our company. First quarter adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share grew 17% year over year and our full-year revenue and per-share earnings outlook is strengthening, as Dave Wichmann will describe shortly. Since we know exchanges are in the minds of many of you, let me take a quick minute for an update. As you know, we have been evaluating public exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We have maintained our regular public dialog with you since November about the individual exchange market and how our own experience and performance have been unfavorable in these markets. The smaller overall market size and shorter-term higher risk profile within this market segment continue to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis. Next year we will remain in only a handful of states, and we will not carry financial exposure from exchanges into 2017. We continue to remain an advocate for more stable and sustainable approaches to serving this market and those who rely on it for care. With that, I will now ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's exceptional performance and then Dave to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide UnitedHealth Group comments. Larry?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman: Thanks, Steve. Optum is off to a strong start again this year, consistent with the ambitious plans we shared with you at our Investor Conference last December. Optum will again grow revenue at more than 20% and earnings from operations at above 30% this year. We continue to estimate Optum will contribute 42% or more of enterprise-wide operating earnings this year, even considering our ongoing investments to support the future growth of this young business. Optum's performance reflects the large-scale opportunities we are pursuing and the tremendous efforts our 100,000 employees make to deliver differentiated services and capabilities to those seeking to solve complex challenges across the healthcare system. Our first quarter revenues of $19.7 billion grew 54% year over year or 11% prior to acquisitions. OptumRx revenues grew 72% to $14.3 billion, while OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to $5.7 billion, which is growth of 21% over the first quarter of 2015. Our first quarter operating margin of 5.6% includes the continuing increase of pharmacy care revenues as you have seen in the past two quarters. Overall, Optum produced $1.1 billion in earnings from operations. As you may know, we identified five drivers for Optum's growth over the next five years. They are pharmacy care services, care delivery, technology, government services, and international. Last quarter we spent some time on a more detailed review of care delivery. Today we will focus on pharmacy care services then follow up briefly with data analytics. Pharmacy care services is a high priority area for us. This focus goes back from 5 years to the original decision to undertake the largest and arguably most complex business in-sourcing ever attempted. It required significant investments, precise execution and flawless delivery. As you know now, it has been a real success. Last year we took another step, our combination with Catamaran led by Mark Thierer who now heads our entire OptumRx platform and serves as a senior member of our overall Optum leadership team. This combination was a significant advance of scale and today the business is running at over 1 billion scripts annually up from 350 million in 2012. Eight months in, the greatly expanded OptumRx is advancing a meaningful differentiated solution for clients in the marketplace with distinctive capabilities around patient centered data analytics, new capabilities in specialty pharma such as home infusion and workplace related resources. Since we came together our retention rates have persisted in the high 90%s and we are building our largest ever pipeline of opportunities. We were pleased this quarter to announce an innovative partnership with Walgreens to which we are creating a 90 day at retail pharmacy offering. This is all about meeting consumers where and when they want whether that means home delivery or walking into the local Walgreens store. Together, will provide choice and cost savings to our clients as we work and benefit together in a meaningful more collaborative way. We are enthusiastic about the potential of the extension of our relationship with Walgreens, the largest retail pharmacy in the U.S. Overall, this year we expect OptumRx to generate more than $58 billion in revenues and manage nearly $80 billion in pharmacy spend for our customers including $30 billion in specialty drug spending. Pharmaceutical spending comprises 12% to 15% of the overall cost of health benefits and has been the traditional focus of the pharmacy benefits industry. We find that focus much too limiting when it comes to improving health and healthcare overall. The impact OptumRx has on healthcare and its cost has the potential to be profoundly broader and deeper. Here you have the most frequent consumer touch point in all of healthcare, one that provides great visibility into the full healthcare continuum. An individual's engagement with OptumRx becomes more impactful when we break out of the one-dimensional procurement and formulary arbitrage model of today and open up providing consumers integrated medical and pharmaceutical services. In the process, we help reduce unnecessary overall systems utilization including ER visits, hospital admissions and readmissions and provide more effective and timely interventions to improve adherence and health outcomes. That's the value proposition of the future we are focused on. Employers using our integrated and technology enabled approach can save in excess of $120 per member per year across their combined medical benefit. In summary, our objective for the impact of this business goes far beyond traditional pharmaceutical management to where the potential to influence both the consumer and the health system for the better is much greater. That is why pharmacy care services are core to our growth and value story over the next decade. Optum also is delivering differentiated value from our work inside the health systems. Our second core to our growth are unrivaled existing capabilities in healthcare data science and analytics. Companies new to the space are excited about the potential that someday these forces will vault healthcare into a new age. For Optum's customers, that someday is today. We are meeting their critical needs right now. We are the leader in using advanced technology and predictive analytics to connect stakeholders across the care continuum with the insights to better manage the health of populations and the resources they depend on. Our continuously updated, integrated and curated clinical and claims data asset comprises more than 80 million lives of robust clinical data and 170 million lives of claims data. We can see from both sides. Beyond the 250 million clinical and administrative lives, our diverse and comprehensive data set includes 8 billion lab results, 4 billion determinations and 3 billion medical procedures. We can provide a real-time clinical and financial picture that is fully integrated and spans years of longitudinal detail. Our health data resources continued to grow securely and responsibly every day. Today, our analytics products are helping thousands of care providers. And ultimately, the millions of consumers they serve translate data into action and action into better medical outcomes. Today, not someday, we help our customers step up from reacting to challenges to designing and implementing actions that reliably lead to better health delivered at lower cost. Today, we are delivering the wealth of information, analysis, and positive benefits of big data with results that include double-digit improvements in critical performance factors like utilization and chronic disease control, which in turn empower care providers to adopt and succeed in new models of care and related new revenue streams. Today, we lead the way in implementing predictive analytics in healthcare because healthcare is all that we do. Healthcare technology and data analytics have been our specialized focus for years. So while others learn to crunch large amounts of static data, Optum is fully integrated into the live flow of healthcare transactions, enabling us to provide up-to-date useful information that makes the healthcare system more intelligent and enables it to act that way. Now, let me turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Larry. As we open 2016, UnitedHealthcare's momentum continues. Strong new customer growth and historically high retention levels reflect the competitive value UnitedHealthcare offers in the marketplace. Quarter by quarter and year by year, we continue to gain new customers and retain valuable established customers who choose the combination of our more engaging consumer experience, distinctive service, product innovation, and integrated clinical and network value. People using our modern consumer-based benefit designs are supported by actionable information available at their fingertips, enabled and delivered by advanced analytic capabilities, as Larry just described, increasingly channeled through consumer and care provider-friendly mobile technologies. Employers continue to be drawn to well-managed competitive cost trends, physician and consumer engagement, and value-based arrangements for care delivery. We partner with our largest customers to benchmark performance and design customized plans that help them advance year by year along the continuum of ever-improving benefit performance and heightened consumer engagement. And we are serving individual patients and overall populations with more complex medical conditions. Our coordination of services and ability to close gaps in care significantly increase the value we bring to consumers and customers. Simply put, the greater the level of patient needs, the more we can help. As a result, we continue to deliver exceptional organic growth. Our U.S.-based benefits businesses grew organically to serve 1.3 million more people with medical benefits in the first quarter, and that brought organic growth to 2 million people in the past year. Looking at commercial markets, we are up about 700,000 people in the quarter and 1 million people since March 2015. First quarter 2016 delivered diversified growth across self-funded national accounts, public sector, small groups, middle-market businesses, and individuals. Turning to exchanges, as we expected when we spoke with you in January, we grew roughly 300,000 lives through the first quarter and served 795,000 people on public exchanges as of March 31. We expect that level to decline to around 650,000 by December. Through this first quarter, we have seen no change in our estimates of cost from the 2015 exchange period. This quarter, with the majority of our 2016 exchange members new to us, we have been appropriately cautious in our reserve estimates, reflecting an additional $125 million in full-year 2016 exchange losses. These were fully absorbed in this quarter and fully considered for the year in our guidance range. And as Steve mentioned, we do not anticipate financial exposure to exchanges in 2017. In Medicare, the value of our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to resonate, differentiated by the stability of our benefits, networks, membership, and distribution systems. We offer seniors clear value and a consistent modern consumer experience, all of which drive new growth as well as strong consumer retention. This strength is reflected in our first quarter membership growth of about 300,000 seniors. Medicare is a consumer business, with seniors receiving a variety of outreach approaches focused on better and more consistent care, such as receiving home visits, and benefiting from our personalized, compassionate, and education-focused consumer service. In 2015, we helped close 9 million gaps in care for seniors we serve. And we expect nearly 65% of our members to be in a four-star plan by 2017, with further improvement in that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more. We believe our Medicare prescription drug benefit business will be much better positioned for 2017. We've pulled back in a number of markets this year to reposition products and added membership and the new product potential via a modest acquisition in the first quarter. Our Part D membership decreased 70,000 people in the first quarter and should decline by another 200,000 or so by year-end. This suggests we will serve 4.7 million to 4.8 million people by year-end 2016, considerably better than what we projected last December. And we expect to return to growth in Medicare Part D in 2017. Switching to Medicaid, managed care serves as the most effective proven tool to ensure budget sustainability for state Medicaid programs. This financial predictability along with the ability of managed care to expedite systems transformation, comprehensively integrating care while addressing social determinants, has resulted in an unprecedented level of procurement activity. Of special note is the significant increase in the volume of opportunities for populations with more complex needs, such as people served by long-term services and support programs. The recent award of Nebraska's integrated health, behavioral, and pharmaceutical model reinforces these expected trends in procurement to include more populations with more complex needs and to look to integrated solution to address state's needs. Our expectation for continued expansion of opportunities to serve all Medicaid populations was reinforced by our recent award in two California counties and across our community and state business the addition of 145,000 people in the first quarter. Let me now touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. Building on the strength of our first quarter, we expect full year revenues of approximately $182 billion, up from our prior outlook of $180 billion to $181 billion led by strength in OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual. Strong first quarter results combined with a slightly lower tax rate for the balance of the year and the impact of recently completed acquisitions allows us to increase our outlook for adjusted net earnings by $0.15 to a range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. We continue to foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion. As you know, we expect Optum to grow full year operating earnings by more than 30% in 2016. We continue to expect seasonality to be a factor in our overall earnings results. Similar to years past Optum expects to generate in the area of 60% of its operating earnings in the second half of the year while the current consensus view appears to be modestly more first-half biased. Taken together, this suggests that updates for full year UnitedHealth Group earnings per share estimates after recognition of our first quarter performance would most appropriately be focused on the second half of this year. Turning to capital, we closed the quarter with a strong balance sheet. We expect share repurchase activity to be more pronounced in the first half of this year with the second half focused on debt reduction toward targeted levels and we will see our dividend levels \u2013 we will address our dividend levels at our June board meeting as we do each year. Steve?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Dave. Today we are in a strong position at a unique moment in time. We have the opportunity to considerably elevate our performance around quality and customer satisfaction, delivering greater value and driving unparalleled organic growth across our entire franchise. While remaining as always disciplined on pricing and cost management. We are focused on delivering higher quality at every touch point with every customer and consumer, doing this well elevates customer trust and loyalty, loyalty that becomes the foundation for an extended period of growth benefiting consumers, society and shareholders. We're intensely focused on this agenda and expect it will produce strong clean results in 2016 and a positive view of opportunities in 2017 and the decade to come. So thank you for your interest today. And operator, could we please open for questions, again one per analyst please this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: And we can take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for the question, nice quarter. Can you explain to me a little more about what's going on with the individual exchange business? You've given us a lot of information, but it sounded like you said $125 million added to reserves, so that would be like $0.08 of earnings pressure this quarter, and I think you talked about only $0.15 of earnings pressure for the whole year previously. So I'm trying to understand whether that was all earnings pressure this quarter or was that coming out of the PDR? What's the PDR value today on the balance sheet, maybe would help. And finally, how does the withdrawals at the various state levels impact what you're doing with Harken Health?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So let me go with the \u2013 so I'll have Dan respond to the first part of this, I'll just indicate that Harken is a small and interesting innovation that we are considering and we will stay with it, again it's in a very modest pilot position. So it really doesn't affect our review of this in terms of the way we're thinking about our positioning on exchanges on a state-by-state basis. We will be down to, again, a handful of states that we will be actively participating in the exchange. Dan, why don't you just give them the overall baseline in terms of the exchange P&L outlook?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Sure. Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: So let me \u2013 why don't I recap what we shared with you in our prior conversations and then talk specifically about what we're updating today. So in January we described an expected combined loss for both the 2015 and 2016 policy years of $1 billion. Inside that, the 2015 policy year loss was $475 million, and that number, as Dave mentioned, remains unchanged. Obviously, the balance related to the 2016 policy year, so at that point was estimated at $525 million. Today we are updating our full year outlook for the 2016 policy year to a loss of $650 million. So that $125 million increase was fully recognized in our first quarter financials and not surprisingly our PDR, as you asked, did increase over the course of the first quarter. As we look at it, our enrollment is very much in keeping with our expectation at that 795,000 lives on the exchange specifically, and I'll tell you that well over half of that enrollment is new to us this year. So as we look at it, the early indications on the health status of the members appears to be a little bit worse, so we are being appropriately cautious in updating our full year outlook and recognizing that additional $125 million in the first quarter financial results. In the month of June, importantly, we will have a first indication of how our risk scores actually compare to the industry and we will look forward to updating you further at that time with regard to our individual ACA business. Thank you.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's really helpful. And then how much is the PDR value exactly now?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: It's bigger.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: What we're trying to convey is that we added $125 million to the quarter and added for the full year. So the PDR has increased. We weren't going to get into the exact amount of the PDR in this morning's. Maybe we can take that off line through the course of the day.\nPeter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll take the next question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. I was hoping you could help us understand the prior year reserve development figure, how that breaks out? It's obviously a lot larger than what you had a year ago. How do we think about that benefiting or not benefiting the first quarter earnings? And if you can just give us any detail on where that came from?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Dave, you want to handle that?\nDavid Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Thank you, Matt, for the question. The prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2016 advanced explicitly by about $220 million or so, and that on a comparative quarter basis. That influenced our MLR favorably in the quarter as well as our EPS as well. The development, although I won't get into the specifics of how that's broken out by line of business, it was pretty broad reaching across all of our lines of business, and really is reflective of what we experienced in the fourth quarter as well, which is the delayed realization of affordability efforts and end market initiatives that we pursued in UnitedHealthcare in the back half of 2015. So we're very pleased with how our trends are developing consistent with the forecast that we provided you before and obviously this is a favorable development in the quarter.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And last year's first quarter was actually unusually low. Dan, do you have anything else to respond?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: No, the only thing I'd highlight is just add a little bit more color on some of the things that are contributing. As we look at trying to drive greater value for customers and consumers that we serve, some of the areas not surprisingly we've talked to you about at length in the past, our focus on inpatient management is ever present, 2015 marked our seventh consecutive year of absolute reductions in both admissions and bed days on a per capita basis and that's true across all of our lines of business. But we also extend that work into other areas with particular focus around outpatient because it's one of the bigger drivers of cost and making sure that we're driving care to the most appropriate setting and likewise looking at out-of-network spend. So there's some context, Matt, on some of the things that we're looking at. And as you look at the contribution to the quarter, I would tell you the change in the development, the majority of that, was P&L impacting to your question.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think if you look over...\nMatthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you look over the last four years you'd say this quarter was more normal and that last year would be more of a low outlier. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Larry, you're very good at boiling things down to bullet point lists. I wondered if, in this data analytics conversation, you could talk about the audiences that are consuming your technology in data analytics and I'm interested in the breadth there, and perhaps where you see the most significant untapped opportunity for monetizing the data and analytics?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman: Do you want me to take it?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman: Dave, it's Larry Renfro. I'm going to ask Bill Miller to comment on this and he'll take you through into some of the specifics of areas that we are talking to and people we are talking to. But in general, across the \u2013 nationally, obviously, we are working with everybody on the provider side as well as we are also working with our own programs internally at UHC. So we've got a good start in terms of how we're using the data, the analytics. it's a key, key component in terms of how we're headed for the future. Bill?\nBill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight: Yeah, I'd say just to follow-up \u2013 and I appreciate the question, Dave. If you look at our history, we've got decades of experience really using analytics as a foundational tool to build a lot of businesses. And when you ask about constituencies that we serve, it ranges, as Larry mentioned, from providers, payers where we're particularly strong, but also government, pharma who we've been servicing for a long time, and now more recently, consumers and employers. Just to give you a flavor for some ways that they're consuming these analytics, I mean, from a payer and provider standpoint, people have been using our analytics to close gaps in care on a monthly basis. We fire off 131 billion rule-based decisions every month to help close gaps using our tool like Optum One, which you've heard a lot about. It's really crunching and assessing both clinical and claims data to predict where we're going to see people that need interventions, and those interventions are additive to the tool and how we've extended it in terms of being able to action it where we can actually go out and prove where we've shown how our interventions intercede in people having strokes, people having heart attacks, and what that saves not obviously is good for the patient, but obviously good for the system. Our revenue cycle analytics actively are taking out friction between payers and providers, speeding up payment, driving more accuracy and improving the financial conditions of both payers and providers. So I could go on and provide a lot examples, but they range from strong financial performance that our analytics drive to clinical performance which really drive better outcomes and lower costs.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So if I could summarize, all the markets you would expect. Payer, provider, employer, state, Federal, anybody who sponsors a broad program, domestic, U.S., international and life sciences. And I'd say we are kind of in the second or third generation in terms of tools, tools that could be effective, and I'd parse them into two areas: kind of those that really affect clinical encounters and outcomes so they're kind of more in the Optum Care domain, where you can really drive performance; and then those that are broader system-wide, which might be more in the Optum360 domain. And then the other thing I'd say is that we're in the early stages because the process of those who are interested in these analytics are really just getting going and being able to use them at their full value in terms of the real-time speed they operate at, et cetera, because they're used to things that are much slower, agreed?\nBill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight: Agreed, and I think that's where we've seen a lot of the uptake, Dave. As reform has hit, it's the need for speed, the need for action, the need for having tools that actually allow you to take, affect, and move the needle with respect to cost, quality, and outcomes is critical in how they integrate with other systems.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Whether they're at a consumer level or whether they're at a system-wide level.\nBill Miller - Chief Executive Officer, OptumInsight: Right.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And so that's why I think we're in the early stages but have such a well-established base in this, so I would think that there will be continued evolution and growth to come from this.\nDavid Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC: Very good, thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.\nSarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you for the question. Can you speak to some of the one-time pressures on MLR? So how much was the leap year impact? With the PDR, would there be any pressure on MLR from exchanges that may fall off next year? And how did the four cost buckets end up versus your expectations?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Dan, do you want to touch on that?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Good morning, Sarah.\nSarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning.\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: So as you look at the consolidated care ratio, so we reported 81.7% in the quarter this year, and that compared to last year, it's about 30 basis points increase year over year. As you look inside that, the biggest factor driving the increase was the additional calendar day, and second would be then the exchange impact, and that being partially offset by the change in reported development on a year-over-year basis. I think the last part of your question was on cost categories. Is that what you said, Sarah?\nSarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yes, the four cost buckets, inpatient, outpatient, Rx, physician, how do they trend versus expectations?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Good. So as we looked at our medical costs in the quarter, they were \u2013 we had expected coming into the year a moderate increase in the trend, the underlying utilization trend, and I'll tell you in the first quarter we were able to manage to that outcome and so very consistent with it. On a category basis, I would tell you that I wouldn't spike out any change relative to the guidance that we provided at the investor conference back in December. And we continue to expect on the full year a commercial cost trend in the range of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And you're seeing pressure in the usual places, outpatient, specialty?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Yes.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Testing?\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Yes.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So nothing really changed.\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: No, very consistent with what we described in December.\nSarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.\nScott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us some indicators on how the risk mix is looking on the new Medicare Advantage lives. It looks like United has added around \u2013 accounted for around 65% of the growth in the MA market. So I'm just interested in terms of as you track that, if you can give us some details on how risk scores are looking on the new MA lives. And then in terms of the mix of those members that are coming from competitor share gains as compared to attracting them from fee-for-service? Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve Nelson?\nSteven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer: Sure, thanks. Good morning, Scott. We're really pleased with the growth that we saw in both the open enrollment period, but also in our outlook for SEP, the special election period. And this growth is a result of the hard work we've been talking to you about over the past two or three years around \u2013 and putting ourselves in a position to offer stable benefits. But the work around improving our stars, engaging our network differently and aligning incentives, really good engagement with our distribution system, and then innovations in our member experience have all led to not only strong sales, but it's important to note, strong retention as well. So the vast majority of our membership is retained membership, membership that we have great experience with. But in terms of the mix across \u2013 and the different categories that I would think about in describing our mix is around geography, which is very broad-based. The growth came pretty evenly across our geography, so that was very much in line with our expectations. Our new to Medicare population, we're seeing actually that population choose Medicare Advantage more often, the percentages growing there, and we see that sequentially. That's our experience, but that again is very much in line with our expectation. And then the new-to-us category, which folks that have just enrolled in other plans and enrolled in one of our plans again is very much in line with our expectations. So we're seeing a really strong performance in this business over the first quarter, and we expect to build on that. And our outlook for growth in 2017 is really strong in both \u2013 I should mention in both the individual and the group retiree segment as well, as we're seeing a really strong pipeline there.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So really what I'd say is in three dimensions, well dispersed geographically, well mixed between new to Medicare and new to us, and then a good mix between individual and group, so stable group.\nScott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. So it sounds like broad-based pretty much across all the channels is the bottom line.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think the point you made about how well dispersed we are geographically is key, so good question. Next, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChristine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning, thank you. You mentioned that international is one of your five major pillars. Could you speak to where you expect to see the growth, where you're seeing the opportunities in international? And how is Brazil doing?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. They actually, I think, are two different categories, so I'll ask Larry to touch on international because I think when we talked about it in the context of growth it was more on the Optum side. And then Dave can touch on Brazil.\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman: So, Christine, it's Larry. I think we sized back at the investor conference in December, we sized that market as being about a $500 billion business. This is a marathon, it's not a sprint. We are getting established. We have actually been in the UK for about 10 years. But what we're really engaging in today is much broader. It's down the lines of integrated care. We're working with the trust, and in the UK the trust would be the hospitals. We're working with what's called NHS Improvement. They're the organization that really monitors the trust. We're working with NHS. We're working with the Prime Minister's office, the Department of Health. So we have a variety of programs that we have underway, and we believe that we're pretty well-positioned at this point to bring a lot of the products and services that we actually have in the States. I didn't want to interrupt the conversation a few minutes ago about the data and the analytics, but that also is a very, very good area for us to introduce, and we're working to do just that as we speak today. Dave?\nDavid Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Christine. It's Dave Wichmann. So just specifically a few comments on Amil and the activities we've undertaken. The business remains profitable as it was last year. Similar to last year, it's continued to become more and more competitive in the market and I'd say the market segments that are the most attractive in Brazil. And the performance improvement across the business has been substantial. We have put in very strong pricing and cost containment disciplines. We've improved our service substantially down there, I'd say, to more of a kind of a UnitedHealthcare-style service approach, but in Brazil. Our Net Promoter Scores in the market continue to advance, and we have a more extensive and better performing healthcare delivery company broadly, so I'd characterize that all as a stronger foundation. Obviously, we're still impacted by the devaluation of the real. That affects both our revenues and then you can see it there probably best, where in local currency, we have a 16% increase in our revenues, but when you translate into the U.S. dollars, it's a 15% decrease. And I think it's obvious that the economy is not particularly strong there, companies are struggling, middle class is flat to declining slightly, and obviously the political situation is unsettled. It certainly doesn't help things a whole lot. So we are pretty measured in terms of our view about Brazil right at this point in time. We are competitive, like I said, in certain segments and we are focused on our growth in those segments, and we are growing. We do have a fair amount of in-group attrition right now as employment levels decline on a \u2013 at an employer-by-employer basis, but we are seeing growth underneath all of that, which is very encouraging. I think most important, really, as it relates to Amil is that we've \u2013 not only are we a strong insurance company, but we've created a strong healthcare delivery company throughout the course of the time that we've owned Amil and we see that as very positive positioning in that market and a meaningful source of our overall performance advance expectations here in 2016.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So profitable despite the economic stress, not particularly helpful political environment, but continuing to actually fare well and growing as a \u2013 in terms of its dimension as a delivery system, which I think is distinctive in that market. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Brian Wright with Sterne Agee CRT.\nBrian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Thanks for the question, good morning. The last time I think you all updated the market sizing opportunity for Optum was back in 2011 at over $500 billion. Do you have any updated thoughts on what the size of the opportunity is now?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman: Sure. It's Larry. Brian, we have sized the \u2013 and I'm going to turn this over to John Rex. I'm probably going to answer the question and then he won't have anything to say, but the domestic side today, we would size at about $680 billion, and the international side at $500 billion. So you're looking at $1.180 trillion that would be the market size. I don't know, John, do you have anything?\nJohn Franklin Rex - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Optum, Inc.: No, that's accurate. That's where would be in terms of the current view of domestic, up from the initial $0.5 trillion. And you think about that growth across, you know, at that point, we talked about eight markets. I would say that there's been growth across all those markets. I'd highlight areas really probably in such as care delivery and kind of technology is among those areas that have been growing among the faster since we last provided that. But kind of a proportionate movement in terms of the area that we spiked out a few years ago.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So next question, please.\nBrian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hello, everybody. Maybe I'll just ask about the acquisition pipeline and the opportunities. It looks like you spent about $1.7 billion in the quarter. I know there was \u2013 I've read about the Symphonix deal. I wonder if you could comment on some of the other opportunities that you've seen and taken advantage of.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So maybe we'll talk a little bit about the M&A activity we have done. We typically don't comment on where we're going in these areas for a whole host of obvious reasons, so our comments in M&A are more retrospective than they'll be prospective.\nDavid Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer: A.J., thanks for the question. It's Dave Wichmann. So our acquisition pipeline and our acquisition activities are really focused in a couple of areas in particular. Obviously, we just got done talking about the size of the services market globally, and so we continue to invest capital to access or broaden our capabilities across Optum and then to also establish a foundational market position, so it can grow from there. We also see interest in the \u2013 still in the international markets, although our activities there have dampened just a bit given the \u2013 how those global markets are performing overall. And of course we still have interest kind of broadly across our business. We haven't done much in the health plan space in quite some time because of all the work that we've done over the course of the last two decades to establish strong market presence as well as strong presence in each Medicare, commercial and Medicaid. But certainly we would continue to consider those things in the future. As it relates to the first quarter, I think folks know that we funded the Helios acquisition at that time, which is a workplace health PBM, in the first quarter. We also, as we have indicated in the past, have a strong interest in continuing to develop our OptumCare business. And so there's a small acquisition inside there as well.\nA.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No real change. The same basic agenda, looking at capabilities, looking to build out the platforms. Probably on the international side there might be more opportunity in services and benefits at the time, so good question. Next, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Tom Carroll with Stifel.\nThomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning. So question on the tax rate and the intangibles comments you had in your prepared remarks and the press release today. What should we think about as the tax rate going forward from here for the rest of the year? And what do you think is the sustainability of the benefits into 2017?\nDavid Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer: Tom, it's Dave Wichmann again. So thanks for your question. The tax rate change is really because there was a new accounting pronouncement that came out in March, which we think has a $0.10 impact on the full year of which we recognized $0.06 in the first quarter. The pronouncement wasn't required to be adopted until 1/1/2017, but as is often the case, if we're prepared to adopt, we go ahead and adopt early as allowed by the pronouncement. The sustainability of that is this is going to be a little bit of a challenge, I think, broadly for companies because what it does is subjects your tax rate or your tax position to more of a period type cost or some more volatility overall in the expected effective tax rate, and in part because it has to do with the combination of the performance of your stock and then also the timing of option exercises as well as stock-based plans, either vesting and/or becoming available to employees at given points in time. So there will be a little more volatility in the rate. We expect the full year rate to be in the neighborhood of about 41% or so for the full year 2016. And we'd expect on that at least this impact, if you will, of the new accounting pronouncement to be pretty consistent year-after-year, depending upon, again, how the stock price performs as well as the vesting activity underlying our equity-based plans.\nDavid Scott Wichmann - President & Chief Financial Officer: But it is a year-by-year proposition and so long as you have equity-based compensation and a belief that your stock is going to continue to perform, there will be tax benefits that come through and then they'll just come through quarter-by-quarter. Right?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: These used to go through equity in the past, so they're now just going through the P&L. And one other question you might have, just to make it clear, why is it $0.06 in the first and $0.04 in the balance of the year, and it is just the timing of the way in which we issue equity in our business, which is generally in the first quarter.\nThomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James.\nMichael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks a lot. Larry, I just wondered if you could you update us on your retail care, neighborhood care model in terms of giving us a sense of what number of locations you're up to, and if the target is still kind of 25 to 30 clinics a year?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman: Sure. I'm going to ask Jack Larsen to join in this conversation. But that target, as you said, of 30, I'd say we might try to be a little more aggressive about that. If we kind of back up and we kind of look at our business and I think you're pretty much aware of this is our overall business plan, we're trying to be in 75 markets and we're balancing how we do that through acquisitions, through startups and so forth. So we are progressing on target, and our expectations are that we will continue to grow and that's one of the areas, as Dave mentioned, that we will be looking to have acquisitions in, more along the care delivery side, but from I think you're speaking more about the urgent care and what we're doing there. So let me turn it over to Jack and let him answer this question.\nJack Larsen - Executive Vice President, OptumCare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Thanks, Larry, and good morning, Michael. Yeah. I would just amplify what Larry said, we do have aspirations for rather smart growth with our standalone neighborhood care centers. I think from a consumer and retail point of view we're seeing great receptivity for the units, the kind of services we offer. And look, one of the more important determinants of overall healthcare cost is where a consumer enters the healthcare system, and we think what it is that our neighborhood care centers offer with respect to the portfolio of services and retail orientation of it, really hits the mark in a number of ways.\nMichael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then just one quick question. At some point should we expect the rebranding effort to come under the Optum banner, or is that not necessary given the local dynamics that are out there?\nLarry C. Renfro - Chief Executive Officer-Optum & Vice Chairman: We're always studying that, but what I would tell you, and I think you know this pretty well that this is all about local care delivery and being in local communities. So the brand is pretty strong in the different areas where we work. We do brand it as Powered by Optum and so forth, but those things are six of one, half a dozen of the other, so we're going to have to watch that for a period of time before we make any decision about full branding.\nMichael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for the update.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.\nJoshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for fitting me in here, guys. I want to talk about the commercial business. The membership numbers came in a little bit stronger than we were looking in the first quarter, so curious where some of those gains are coming. And then I'm really more interested in the 2017 national account selling season and what you're seeing there, how customers are reacting to the potential mergers for some of the two or four of the bigger companies out there? And maybe, are you just seeing more accounts put out RFPs, or do you think retention levels for the industry will be similar and maybe this is a 2018 event?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let's do the first one first with Dan, and then maybe Jeff can comment on the national business scene.\nDaniel J. Schumacher - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Josh. I appreciate the question. Certainly in the quarter we had very strong growth in our commercial business. It was well balanced across both funding status as well as geography, and then within that by line of business. As we talked at the investor conference, you can look at the fully insured result as an example. The results inside there are actually muted a little bit by a large customer in a third-party exchange that went through a funding conversion. So if you actually adjust it for that, you'd see inside there really are strong growth in our small and middle market, and we continue to see customers responding to the value proposition that we're offering in the market. And we also see from a pricing standpoint our competition moving more in line with us. So as they orient more around a future outlook of cost that resembles something closer to reality, what we see is that we're becoming more competitive, and that market frankly favors is.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff?\nJeff Alter - Chief Executive Officer-UnitedHealthcare Employer: Sure. Good morning, Josh. It's Jeff Alter. The national account selling season is probably just cost of the cycle. It's down from the last few years. There aren't a lot of large clients out to bid. I think part of that is the industry does a lot of proactive renewals, the same as we do, to keep some of the large clients from going out to a full bid. It's early. The market is sizing up now, we're in a season of the finalist meetings. Probably by June we'll get a better sense of where we're positioned and how that market is shaping up. But it is a selling season marked with a lot of smaller cases as opposed to some of the past seasons that had some fairly large clients out to bid.\nJoshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So no real impact from any of the pending mergers, is that fair?\nJeff Alter - Chief Executive Officer-UnitedHealthcare Employer: Fair now. I'll probably update you a little bit better once we get through the finalist season and some of the post-finalist discussions.\nJoshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That may be more a dynamic to the next year.\nJoshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's probably more a dynamic next year. So maybe we only have time for maybe two more questions. So next, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities USA.\nSheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hello, gentlemen, thank you very much. And as always, it's a pleasure to look at your earnings release. So I'm going to step back from some of the important details we've been discussing and focus on the question of how UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare are integrating, which is always one of my focus areas. But in particular, my concern is that the cost out of pocket is very significant for the consumer. If you go on the exchanges and you try to price an individual policy, it can cost you $38,000 without subsidies. Similarly, if you're insured by an employer, your out-of-pocket costs rise every year, yet Optum is clearly influencing through tying its analytics and services to the actual provision of care and changing that process. Optum is clearly influencing United; it's clearly influencing the market. When or how can United take a leadership role to revolutionize or take that next step to revolutionize the benefit and cost structure so that we consumers can actually see it in our pockets and United can gain share and then really dominate the market?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That is quite a question, and I admire the direction of it. But maybe I could only respond to it in the broadest context.\nSheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: That would be great, thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: If I were to take some of the national account clients that we're privileged to serve and who have been more progressive adopters of the entire breadth of capabilities that we can bring to them and then working with them cooperatively and then working with them in terms of how they are engaging their consumers, if you will, you actually see distinctive performance patterns. And you see them distinctive in terms of, I'd say, two dimensions, better use of the healthcare resource system, resources in total, and a year-by-year improvement in the consistency of that pattern of usage, and improvement in their overall health status as they embrace with and get comfortable with programs that are more consumer-friendly and easier and, as you suggest, fueled with data analytics that are now really positioned that they can actually act on them and the whole spectrum of what we have been talking about that some of the things that we are doing and capabilities we're putting in the marketplace on a real-time basis. The marketplace is adjusting in terms of how do I exactly use these. They know directionally how they want to use them. I don't know if they are nuts and bolts to quite that point, but these more progressive clients have had distinctively better cost positions and distinctively better patterns of consumer decisions, resource utilization, and health status, wellness. If we can translate that from those venues to the more progressive \u2013 to make them more progressive in other sectors of the marketplace, and I think about the large government sectors because they have the same attributes as large health employer sponsors. They are sponsoring large populations. They have more influence on how these programs go. Then you begin to get into the water with respect to consumer behavior and you get into the water with respect to care provider behavior. And those kinds of developments I think can really establish these patterned measures, can really drive change. And clients are seeing it, states are seeing it, governments are seeing it. Some of Larry's commentary with respect to international is showing some of these patterns to international governments that have arguably a different healthcare system. And their response to these things and then the whole idea that the technology is now capable of doing this at such scale and such speed and doing it down to a mobile expression, whoever uses that mobile expression, whether it's a care provider or a consumer, those things are playing out. So we are in the early stages, the best way to see it is in the large national accounts. And then, believe it or not, you can see it in some of the things like Medicaid, where you can see large state sponsors that once they really get these programs in a mature state, are driving distinctive results relative to the populations they're serving. The next stage is really getting this directly to the consumer. And I think there, platforms like Rally really represent the first generation of a way to actually jump over and really get in the consumers' head using these applications and things like that. And I think this is just the beginning. So that would be my reaction to it. I don't know if we can react in a more granular way. So I thank you for that question and next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nAna A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yes, thanks. I appreciate you fitting me in. On the Medicare rate, could you give us your thoughts for 2017? Any reactions to the 0.85% post the fixing of the error, the risk coding changes, and the impact on your partial and full dual mix of business, the employer group waiver plan? And then on the HIF, the tax holiday, do you see that flowing through to seniors and accelerating industry growth? And how does that all impact your book of business for 2017? Is it about a top line or margin expansion?\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think we're going to get into \u2013 we typically don't get into the nuts and bolts of the Medicare rate. We would again kind of express disappointment that the funding patterns that Medicare has been using for Medicare Advantage seems to under-fund a program that is so well embraced by seniors and so effective at serving them. So we continue to advocate for more consistent and more market-oriented funding for that. So, Steve, I'll \u2013 beyond that comment, offer your response to that and then the \u2013 her second question.\nSteven Nelson - Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Good morning, Ana. It's Steve Nelson. I'll just make a couple comments to add to Steve's there, beyond the rates, a little color around insurer's fee and the changes to the group benefits. With respect to insurer's fee, to step back a little bit, our goal is to provide predictable and stable benefits to seniors. It's something that we were able to do this year and that's I think going to be important over the long run. So as you know, we're in the midst of benefit planning right now and that is going to be one factor that we consider amongst several other factors in our pursuit of this goal to offer stable benefits in what, as Steve accurately described it, remains an under-funded environment in 2017. So it will be something that we'll consider and be able to talk more about after we get through our planning season. In terms of the group, change to the group benefit, while we're disappointed in that change, it remains \u2013 I would just say the value to the retirees and employers who are trying to find solutions for the retiree population. Medicare Advantage remains a very strong value proposition, and we're seeing that actually play out in our pipeline development and as we look towards 2017 as one of the strongest in years. So there's a lot of work for us to do in terms of continuing to advocate for seniors on behalf of this very popular and effective program, and we're going to continue to do that. Thanks for the question.\nStephen J. Hemsley - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So that's the end of our questions. So just in closing, I offer that we have a unique opportunity to serve more people in more meaningful ways in distinguished UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare through the quality of our work. And as we elevate our focus on quality service to consumers and customers, we expect broad-based growth to follow. So we thank you, and that concludes our call this morning. Thank you very much for attending.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company\u2019s Investors page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 16, 2017, which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the company\u2019s website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported 2017 results that are ahead of the outlook we shared with you at our investor conference at the end of November. Full year 2017 revenues exceeded $201 billion increasing more than $16 billion year-over-year. Operating cash flows grew to $13.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $10.07 per share with operating earnings from both UnitedHealthCare and Optum ahead of the forecast we provided at our conference. We had an active December on the growth front. We wrapped up the fourth quarter serving the benefit needs of nearly one half million more consumers completing another successful sale season in individual group MA and dual special needs plans as we turn into 2018. And advancing our strategic positions in two of five growth categories by signing both Banmedica and DaVita Medical Group, while maintaining our operating focus to both closed 2017 strongly and we expect to carry that momentum into a healthy start to 2018. We know the effects of tax changes for 2018 are top of mind for many. So we will begin there today with corporate tax reform. Our starting point for determining our approach was with our mission helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone and our recognition of the enormous gap between where healthcare is today and where it could and should be. We concluded that our ambitions for a better health and for a better health system are best achieved through investment in ways that will make healthcare far more affordable and of far higher quality. More specifically corporate tax reform is expected to improve earnings and cash flows by $1.7 billion in 2018. That\u2019s after an estimated $400 million to $500 million reduction in premium revenues due to minimum loss ratio and lower net health insurance fee recapture effects and a 200 million to 300 million additional investment and operating costs as we accelerate existing initiatives and artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, digital health, net promoter score improvements and health related initiatives in local communities. We expect to invest the remaining increased cash flows to better fulfill our mission and in turn to grow and diversify our enterprise for the long-term all aligned to the ambitious agenda we discussed with you on Investor Day. We now expect adjusted 2018 earnings of $12.30 to $12.60 per share and cash flows from operations in the range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion. John Rex will offer more details later in this call and as usual we will be available by phone throughout the day. Before leaving Texas, I would note that we continue to advocate strongly for our multi-year deferral and ultimately the repeal of the health insurance tax given its high cost to consumers and society. If a deferral for 2018 occurs, we plan to return the value to those impacted by the tax. As highlighted in our investor conference, we are pursuing growth and diversification in five key areas, healthcare delivery, pharmacy care services, consumer centric benefits, digital healthcare and global. Our busy December helped us to advance these goals. The combination of OptumCare with DaVita Medical Group establishes primary and ambulatory healthcare delivery in several new local care markets for OptumCare. Through Banmedica and with Amil and Americas medical services in Brazil, we\u2019re establishing a foundation for growth in South America for decades to come. And then Steve Nelson will discuss United Healthcare\u2019s 2018 growth in individual and group Medicare advantage and dual special needs plan should again lead the market. Now let\u2019s turn to businesses starting with Optum\u2019s Chief Executive, Larry Renfro.\nLarry Renfro: Thank you, Dave. Delivering strong results for Optum customers in 2017 enabled us to drive strong revenue and earnings growth and to create opportunities for further growth in 2018. Full year, 2017 Optum revenues increased 9% exceeding $91 billion. 2017 earnings from operations grew by nearly $1.1 billion or 19% with individual businesses earnings growth rate ranging from 16% to 28%. We again balance innovation investments in our businesses and strategic acquisitions with business simplification and focused cost management. The result is improved margin performance. Our full year operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 7.4% including 9.1% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings from operations grew by more than 20% for every reporting business. We entered 2018 with positive indicators for our business outlook. Optum helped serve 91 million people at year-end. Strong 10% growth on a large and growing base. In the fourth quarter, Optum Rx fulfilled 333 million adjusted scripts and OptumInsight advanced this backlog producing full year backlog growth of 19% to $15 billion. Our strategic relationships continued to advance as we became more deeply involved with an increasing number of sophisticated customers. Let me give you a few highlights. In state government services, West Virginia became the first state to engage Optum to integrate program eligibility across all state sponsored health benefit program. Over half the state population or about 900,000 people will access Medicaid as well as other human surface benefits through Optum\u2019s new integrated eligibility platform. We expect to build on our strong and differentiating capabilities serving health plans. Our health plan customers members, our patients, receive quality care from our physicians at local clinics and ambulatory sites of service. We had strong growth in data analytic work related to risk and quality and we received a multi-year award to manage the technology platform modernization for SSS, Blue Cross Blue Shield Puerto Rico. The healthcare transformation alliance relationship is off to an excellent start with 10 companies selecting OptumRx, driven by their interest in quality, cost transparency and total cost management. Finally, with the full implementation for Quest Diagnostic, completed their exceptional performance levels, we now manage more than $65 billion in annual billings on behalf of our diverse revenue management customers and the new client pipeline is vibrant. Acquisitions this past year added market leading platforms, strengthening our capabilities and depth of resources. Surgical care affiliates with its leading ambulatory surgical care practice grew revenues 7% on a same-store basis, driven by ever more complex surgical procedures shifting to non-hospital settings. We plan to accelerate center development in 2018 and 2019. We expanded OptumCare primary care driven practices into 10 new major metropolitan areas. This includes our pending acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, with more than 2000 employed or affiliated physicians serving 2 million patients annually. Like our OptumCare doctors, DMG physicians our well known for delivering high quality care to their patients and are seasoned and are working in a value-based care context on behalf of a diverse group of the most respectful payers. Combined with DMG, OptumCare will be in 35 local care delivery markets, nearly one-half of the 75 markets targeted for engagement or development. And these market operations are still in the early stages of growth and development, a fraction of the size they are targeted ultimately. And we combine with The Advisory Board, the market leader in healthcare research, consulting and technology. We expect Optum to bring further resources, capabilities and value serving the 4,000 hospitals and health systems that comprise The Advisory Board\u2019s membership. And we look forward to accelerating their engagement in the next six months. Finally, we continue to innovate to better serve market needs. We doubled the number of people with Rally IDs in 2017, now more than 15 million, while administrating more than $400 million in consumer incentives. Market interest for this type of scale tested solution is growing. A large local health plan selected Rally as its consumer technology platform and several renowned hospitals are now using Rally for everything from searching for a physician to pricing the appointment and appointment schedule. We launched PreCheck MyScript connecting patients, physicians and health firms with useful information at the point of prescribing, right in the physician\u2019s workflow. PreCheck MyScript has already being used by tens of thousands of prescribers for nearly 1.5 million transactions. We will offer it to all OptumRx members expecting to reach 80% of active prescribers by the end of 2019. And we unified our unique data science and analytics capabilities under the OptumRx brand. We are optimistic about our current progress and our long-term opportunities to continue to advance NPS, to raise quality, to innovate and develop and grow relationships, making the healthcare system work better for everyone. Optum was built over 20 years but we are only just beginning to get a glimpse of its potential. Now let me turn it over to Steve Nelson, the CEO of the UnitedHealthCare.\nSteve Nelson: Thank you, Larry. Like Optum, we\u2019re pleased to report strong growth and performance across our businesses on behalf of those that we serve. UnitedHealthCare\u2019s 2017 revenues exceeded $163 billion, and grew 10% year-over-year. 3 of our 4 businesses posted percentage growth rates in the mid-teens or higher. An employer and individual offerings performed exceptionally well, growing 9% absent the $5.3 billion negative impact of reduced participation and ACA Individual Insurance products and the 2017 Health Insurance Tax Moratorium. Medical costs were well managed for the year and our full year medical care ratio was near the lower end of our original forecast. The full year 2017 commercial medical cost trend was about 5.5% and we continue to forecast the trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points for 2018. Operating costs were well controlled in 2017 as operating margins strengthened 30 basis points to 5.2% with fourth quarter operating margin seasonally lower as expected. We improved our positioning for 2018 and for the long-term. Together with Optum, we renewed early the AERP relationship, a key long-term positive for growth serving the senior\u2019s community. We also strengthen our ability to address the social determinants of healthcare to better serve people with complex needs. And we\u2019re seeing strong interest for multi-site employers in the Nexus ACO products, the first national ACO product targeted to large self-funded customers looking for higher quality and cost performance. Nexus ACO leverages UnitedHealth premium physicians to achieve cost savings of up to 15% as customers see reductions in readmissions, ER visits, inpatient length of stay, and hospital admissions. We expanded into several new markets including the western slope of Colorado and upstate New York. And we\u2019ll enter Minnesota and the northern planes in the second half of 2018. And we began to advance the next generation of digital health and wellness management which is available for seniors based on connected wearable devices and wireless technology. Participants in the UnitedHealthCare Motion Wellness Program have used activity trackers to walk 65 million miles, earning nearly $20 million in incentives to cover out of pocket medical expenses. In 2017, we served 2 million more people in the U.S. employer group, Medicare and Medicaid market segments, including almost 0.5 million more people in the fourth quarter. In Medicaid, we grew by more than 800,000 people in 2017 reflecting entries into new state, support for 110,000 more dual special needs plan numbers and a significant late year expansion in Iowa. In 2018, we expect further growth from our 2017 entries into California and Virginia from further acceleration in serving dual needs special plans and from continued in-market organic growth. The Medicaid pipeline for 2019 and beyond continues to be robust as states increasingly look to manage care for innovation, effective service and cost containment. In Medicare, we serve nearly 1 million more seniors in 2017 and we again expect strong growth in 2018 consistent with our expectations. Based on performance in the annual enrollment period, high customer retention and continued success serving employer group retirees through our national four-star quality plan. In UnitedHealth employer and individual, commercial group full risk offerings group served 130,000 more people this quarter and 465,000 over the past year. We expect some modest pull back in membership in the first quarter followed by sequentially quarterly growth over the balance of the year led by strength and small group fully in line with our Investor Conference growth projections. In global, our Brazil businesses had strong positive 2017 performance and carried that momentum into 2018. We expect to add Banmedica in the first quarter 2018. Banmedica is a provider of healthcare services and health benefits in Chile, Columbia and Peru serving 2.1 million people and operating 13 hospitals with 1,900 beds and 143 medical centers. In many ways the growth opportunities apparent in these South American markets are reminiscent of the opportunities in healthcare markets in the US two decades ago, when consumers and benefits sponsors were seeking better managed benefits and access at lower cost, Medicare advantage plans and managed Medicaid were nascent and Part D did not exist. We expect opportunities for growth in these markets to advance as we have in the past two decades or more in the US. Our 2017 growth and our 2018 outlook demonstrate the competitive value our offerings bring to consumers and the market, rising rates of customer retention and strong new business generation reflect the sustaining value of innovative benefit and network designs, improved service, rising NPS, distinguished clinical engagement and effective cost control. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Steve. We delivered strong well-balanced performance again in 2017. Consolidated revenues exceeded $201 billion, cash flow from operations were $13.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $10.07 increased 25% on top of 25% earnings growth in 2016. We re-valued our US deferred tax liabilities to reflect the newly enacted federal statutory rate of 21% which added $1.2 billion in non-cash earnings in 2017. We have excluded this from adjusted earnings per share. Our expectations for 2018 have been revised solely to reflect the lower expected tax rate now approximately 24%. The incremental investments Dave referred too and items such as rebate obligations related to loss ratio requirements, triggered by the lower tax rate. The change affects several line items which I will step through. We now expect adjusted net earnings per share of $12.30 to $12.60 in 2018, with cash flows from operations rising $1.7 billion from our prior outlook to a range of 15 billion to 15.5 billion. Dave referenced the $400 million to $500 million impact on premium revenues, which we expect to accommodate within the existing $223 billion to $225 billion revenue range we set at our November Investor Conference. We now expect UnitedHealth Group earnings from operations to be in the range of $16.7 billion to $17.3 billion in 2018. This is reduced by 700 million from the prior range. Roughly 400 million to 500 million of which is driven by the premium effects of the new lower tax rate with greater than half attributed to a lower insurers fee gross up. The other factor within this $700 million reflects the end year P&L impact from the investments Dave noted to better serve people and improve the healthcare system, while strengthening our growth and innovation value. We expect these accelerated investments will result in 200 million to 300 million in incremental operating expense. Our current plans while still maturing allocate these investments to both businesses, leaning toward Optum. We now expect our 2018 medical care ratio to run in a range of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. With the midpoint increasing is much as 30 basis points from our prior outlook, again driven solely by mechanics related to the tax rate change. In addition, with these impacts, we expect our 2018 operating cost ratio to run in a range of 15.3% plus or minus 30 basis points with the midpoint 10 basis points above our prior outlook. With respect to our overall capital position and outlook, we expect to continue to follow our longstanding approach to capital allocation. This includes maintaining a consistent approach of investing in the business and returning capital to shareholder, steadily pacing toward a market rate dividend, while targeting a debt to total capital ratio in the 40% range over the long-term. All of the above is contained in the revise 2018 guidance table included in our supplemental information package this morning. The takeaways are that we entered 2018 with growth and earnings momentum and strong financial flexibility, a significantly improved cash flow outlook and a debt to total capital ratio below 39% at year-end 2017 with clear opportunities to put capital to work. Dave?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. 2017 was a strong year for UnitedHealth Group by virtually every measure. Top-line growth, rising NPS, strengthening culture and service, strategic advances, operational execution and as a result, strong financial performance. We are entering 2018 with solid momentum and a clear direction and much to get done. We plan to sustain this ambitious pace most importantly because our mission and culture and those we serve require it. Our goal remains realizing the full growth service and social potential of this remarkable enterprise. Thank you for your investment and interest in support of that goal. We will now open the call for questions. Asking you to limit to one question a piece, so we can get to as many as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. I appreciate some of the detail on tax reform. Just wanted to drill down here a little bit more. First, you talked about the 400 to 500 million and most of that or more than half of that being from the health insurer fee impact. I think it's pretty clear that you know the grossed up of the Medicaid - Medicaid states would require to give you back, needs to be smaller because the taxes go down, but beyond that can you help us understand how much that is of the half or more that\u2019s 400 to 500, how much is commercial and how much is Medicare that you might have passed through which I assume is zero on Medicare. And then more importantly for 2019, would love to hear your thoughts on the sustainability of the tax reform benefit that you\u2019re seeing here in 2018 including any differentiation on that sustainability by business would be really helpful. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Good question Justin, appreciate it. We\u2019ll have John Rex talk about the -- give you a little bit more details on the impact of the $400 million to $500 million on premiums. As it relates to 2019, we\u2019re not really in a position to give elemental guidance at this stage. I understand the question but hopefully you can also appreciate that is as is always the case with respect to market dynamics particularly in the commercial market with respect to pricing it subject to a number of variables including negotiation and also attribution of cost. So, it\u2019s not as -- not to belittle it at all but it's not as simple as applying math. This is something though that as the year progresses and we see what happens with the health insurance tax, we will be very deliberate and making sure that we quantify the effects of that and do so in the context of giving you guidance for 2019. John do you want to discuss the four to five please.\nJohn Rex: Yes, good morning Justin. Let me just give a little more background on how that works which will benefit everyone on the call here. So just recall, when we look through how this works through our P&L, the larger component as I mentioned in my prepared comments is the impact of the lower premium gross, the federal tax rate decline. So, remember the health insurance tax of course in non-deductible, that results in a gross upon the premium line and that flows through the P&L and that impacts the number of ratios as you heard me describe this morning across the P&L. So as a result of the gross at the pre-tax operating earnings of course were impacted. As that requirement declines, it\u2019s neutral on the after-tax earnings line but it impacts pre-tax. So that\u2019s really what we are attempting to go through here. I think you spotlighted one of the kind of the easiest to understand ones in terms of some of our state program arrangements here where really when we went into this, the arrangements for the state were explicitly around being made whole for the tax gross up because of the non-deductibility. So that has an explicit impact as that declines and so some of those state arrangements are explicitly that way and so when we go to collect that we\u2019ll be collecting a gross up rate of 21%. There are other businesses where they have some impact, to contractual arrangements. I\u2019m not going to parse them out in terms of the specific amounts we\u2019ve joined as Dave described. But you\u2019re right about kind of how that impact flows through.\nJustin Lake: I am sorry just wanted to confirm here. In Medicare I think you guys have talked about the gross up not having -- you never passed it through to consumers via lower benefits. So that doesn\u2019t need to be given back. Is that correct? And then on commercial, how much of commercial do you expect to get back over time and how much is already in this number? Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Well, Justin we are -- as it relates to in Medicare in particular -- obviously that\u2019s all subject to a discussion with CMS and negotiation that occurs in connection with the offering of the annual benefits. Our goals are always to maintain as much consistency as possible and benefit offerings, network access, pharmacy offerings, formularies as much as possible to keep those benefits as stable as can be. That\u2019s one of the leading contributors to a very strong net promoter scores with that population. So again, our goals there are to maintain as much stability as possible. As it relates to the market, if you think about what we have here, we\u2019ve got two businesses. One which is regulated and one unregulated. But the regulated business taxes if you will, we have the tax of value of that if you will a piece of that, a good chunk of it goes back to the market through these recapture mechanisms that we\u2019ve outlined here this morning, that\u2019s the 400 million to 500 million that John described. In addition to that, we thought it would be best that we then invest in things that we know happened to be through our P&L, in this case of areas we know where we can improve healthcare quality and reduce healthcare costs in the future. That\u2019s a 200 million to 300 million that John described as well. The vast majority of the residual is either attributed to the Optum business and/or we felt was best and most appropriate for us to invest in continuing to advance healthcare quality and reduce healthcare costs really aimed at trying to achieve this mission around helping people and helping to improve health systems. So that\u2019s where we are at today. We think it\u2019s a fair balance. We think that that balance is something that\u2019s sustainable over the long haul.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. I figured there will be a lot of questions on tax pass-through, I'm going to avoid that one. In your OptumHealth build out, I am curious to what extent or how far along are we in the process of your benefit designs on the UnitedHealthcare side including some type of favorability toward OptumHealth networks, is that something you can do now, is it something that you plan to do, is it something that you need to build more critical mass in OptumCare before you can get there? I am curious about how much -- if you are building a plan that helps the healthcare system to work better, I would think you would want to favor that, I am wondering how much you are doing there?\nDavid Wichmann: It\u2019s a great question Dave and it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s often misunderstood about our OptumCare platform, and that is a multi-payer platform. It serves 80 plus payers broadly. The dynamics around its offerings to the market, particularly around pricing are negotiated including with UnitedHealthcare, there is no favoritism applied other than what you would characterize as normal dynamics in a marketplace. And so, our intention is to not -- is to provide a broad offering and engage the ambitions of all payers so that we can serve more patients. But Andrew, do you want to touch on maybe some of our strategies there and how we\u2019re advancing that business?\nAndrew Hayek: In today\u2019s comments, we are very much committed at Optum and in OptumCare to a multi payer strategy and serving multi payers in the markets we serve is integral to our business models including our medical groups, our IPAs, our ambulatory surgery centers and our neighborhood care centers. So, we work to earn and maintain the trust and confidence of our payer partners around the country. And we do that by providing outstanding value to the members and the communities we serve in terms of quality, patient experience and impacting the total cost of care. And then as you look at the track record that we have as we added IPAs, medical groups, as we added SCA, as we added MedExpress, we have continued the multi-payer strategy of those entities. And in fact, we\u2019ve worked very carefully with each of those payer partners to expand those relationships, continue to serve them and help their success.\nDavid Wichmann: So, Dave it\u2019s fair to say those that get kind of closest to OptumCare, the payers that do are the ones that get the best value out of it. And certainly, UnitedHealthCare works very collaboratively with OptumCare, but several of our payer, our customers do as well. Next question please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll next to Matt Borsch with the BMO Capital Markets.\nMatt Borsch: Thank you. I was hoping that you could just talk about medical trend. And from a couple of different dimensions, number one, to understand as your outlook for going back up to the 6% range versus 5.5% that you experienced, is that just the conservatism that we\u2019ve seen from UNH over the last several years or is there something specific? And I guess related to that is, what you think the impact to the economy is here? And if you\u2019re surprised at all by the 2017 if anything, it seems like a softening of trend relative to the prior year? And sorry, if I could fit this one in and that base of question of the pace of benefits change in the high deductible plan impact in this mix?\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, that\u2019s all right, Matt, I will try to get all those answered. As it relates to medical trend in 2017, our teams worked very hard to control healthcare cost. Usually, our forward view of trend is comprehensive and it also reflected deep respect for the healthcare economy and the ways trends developed overtime. But, I think our teams did a really nice job of continuing to mitigate trend for 2017 and have done -- have taken a prudent approach for 2018 and beyond. Do you want to talk at all about the how trend has advanced year-over-year and maybe what some of the elemental items are?\nLarry Renfro: As Steve Nelson mentioned in his commentary and as Dave touched on where we\u2019re now at 5.5%. So right at the low end of the range from a year ago that we laid out, but completely in line with our investor conference. It really reflects as Dave mentioned, our efforts to manage cost and improve quality and we continue to do that through things like ensuring the right level of care, the right place of service, the effectiveness of our clinical model, alignment with our partnerships and we\u2019re really seeing -- the improvements have really been broad base across our category, I wouldn\u2019t point to anything specific, wouldn\u2019t point to the economy especially around that as well. And as Dave mentioned as to 2018, we\u2019re always respectful of trend and there is nothing that we\u2019ve seen as we closed out 2017 that would view our change at this point for 2018.\nMatt Borsch: What about the pace of benefit change in on how that\u2019s obviously played a role as you move to more employers to high deductible plans. Is that continuing at the same rate going into this year?\nDavid Wichmann: Dan Schumacher, will comment on that, Matt.\nDan Schumacher: Good morning, Matt. It\u2019s Dan.\nMatt Borsch: Good morning.\nDan Schumacher: As you look at the benefits what couple of dimensions to it, right. We have -- if you look at the deductibles, deductibles are rising a little bit faster in 2018 as compared to the rate of increase in 2017 and in part due to the reintroduction, I think of the insurers feed that\u2019s pushing pricing up and putting some pressure on employers to make more adjustments to the benefits. If you look at aggregate buy downs, I think those are relatively comparable year-over-year, but if you just look at the proportion of people that are buying and choosing more progressive plan designs, I would say that that has been a long-standing trend that continues in 2018, just a thing that was in 2017.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tanal: Thanks a lot for the questions, guys. Wanted to just touch on the $400 million to $500 of minimum MLR rebates. I\u2019m sort of curious to understand whether that had anything to do with sort of pricing plans for the all tax regime and what that could mean for 2019. And relatedly on the incremental investments side of things these were described as accelerated programs in the release. And I\u2019m wondering if you can sort of give us a flavor for how much flexibility that might enable for 2018 and then looking into 2019 as well?\nDavid Wichmann: Maybe we will have John Rex address the fore part of that question and then I\u2019ll wrap on the investments.\nJohn Rex: Let me just get back to that. So, to be clear here on the $400 million to $500 million, that\u2019s comprised of two components and the minimum MLR rebate component of that is less than half of that component. The greater component has to do with just really the lower premium gross ups as the federal tax rate declines. I just really want to be clear on that in terms of how that works. So minimum MLRs, less than half of that $400 million to $500 million, it\u2019s really just the mechanical impacts, the recapture impact on the lower premium gross up, that is the majority of $400 million to $500 million. And Dave will address the investments.\nDavid Wichmann: So, Steven it\u2019s a very good question. So, what we\u2019ve done here is we really have investment occurring on two fronts. One is it relates to the $200 million to $300 million as I described earlier, it\u2019s going through the P&L and that\u2019s the one when you\u2019re picking up on a lot of those investments through the P&L are in the application of technology if you will across the business and in order to accomplish a number of things, it\u2019s to both improve the quality of our services to people which includes the advancing of our MPS ambitions which I think we\u2019ve laid out pretty strongly as well as to continue to find ways to improve cost structure thereby delivering greater value broadly to the health system and to individual consumers within it. You should look at that as an uptick in the run rate expectations of our level of investments, partly in response to the tax, a great change if you will. Beyond that is the balance, which is $1.7 billion or so in improved cash flows in the business. And that you\u2019ll see us align more quickly strategically in the market to advance things like our care delivery platforms, which we just discussed. As you know, we are not quite midway through the establishment of the foundation of our market presence in local markets in that business, as an example. So that additional investments and technology related platforms to advance things like precision medicine, genomics, things of that nature where we believe we can apply our capacities as an organization are some of the areas that you will see us advance our investment portfolio.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James.\nMichael Baker: Just trying to get a sense of the size of the PBM pipeline of opportunities this year compared to last year. And if you could gave a little bit of color on market segments that are more active that would be helpful?\nDavid Wichmann: We see nice growth in the PBM, both this year, including the growth within our customer base and we have a nice pipe for 2019. John?\nJohn Rex: So we just finished off a really strong year. We had our new business targets. We also had really good retention as I talked about at Investor Day we\u2019re at almost 98% in terms of our retention. We\u2019ve seen solid growth both with our existing client based, including health plans. So really broad based both across all market segments for 2018. In terms of 2019, I think it's still early. We have a really good pipeline, but their pipeline year-over-year is pretty similar, but it\u2019s actually still early. We have some wins for 01/01/19 already, so we\u2019re seeing strong active growth for the market. And I\u2019d say the big deals we won\u2019t care about until the end of first quarter, so strong pipeline and good growth. I don\u2019t see any changes in terms of what market segments are selling more than others right now. And I\u2019d say last summer comment is that our value story in the market is really resonating. We\u2019re seeing strong interest from sophisticated buyers that are attractive to our pharmacy care services model.\nOperator: Our next question is from A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA .J. Rice: Maybe I\u2019ll just ask you about the acquisition pace, seems like in \u201917 and accelerated and it certainly as we went through the year, it seemed to accelerate as we got toward the end. I mean that could be a function of greater availability of deals; it could be a function of particularly and after we build out the infrastructure; you feel more confident as you can integrate them faster pace of deals; it could be the balance sheet is now as your target. Can you give us a flavor for R&D? We\u2019re in an environment where your acquisition pace is likely to accelerate. And maybe I\u2019ll just throw in there an update on the international outlook since I know both Optum and UHC have pointed to that as a growth area and with the BenMedica deal maybe that brings you back into focus a little bit?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, A. J., very good question. There really is nothing -- we really didn\u2019t accelerate the pace of our acquisition, it's just coincidental that those two acquisitions happen to come at that time. As indicated, they line up nicely with two of the five growth areas of our business. We\u2019ve long indicated that we have an interest in measured investments in global, and that BenMedica allowed us to get into three additional South American markets. We have been studying those markets for about five years, and that allowed us to advance our position there. As you know, we\u2019re in an open process right now to close that transaction. And then the other one was the DMG acquisition, which again I would characterize as more coincidental but highly strategic in terms of our ambitions and interest in building the Optum care platform overall. So really no acceleration, you shouldn\u2019t infer anything with respect to how we\u2019re allocating capital broadly. I would like to just take a moment, if I can, to have Molly Joseph who is our Chief Executive of our International Business, UnitedHealthcare International, maybe just spend a moment on BenMedica and our positioning in South America broadly.\nMolly Joseph: Thanks for the question A. J. Let me just offer my perspective on three things related to our global expansion; first is the business progression we\u2019ve seen in Brazil; second, the pending transaction with BenMedica; and then perhaps touching on how we view Latin America, more broadly. Brazil, we\u2019ve started 2017 with pretty ambitious expectations for the business, particularly in the area of margin improvement. And that was across both our health benefits and our BenMedical delivery businesses. Very pleased that we\u2018ve fully executed on that plan. The improvements are really being driven by a combination of a very strong local management team that focused on innovation and quality and increasing, the localized application of our enterprise capabilities and competencies in clinical, in technology, in data and analytics. So we entered 2018 in Brazil with really strong momentum for continued margin expansion and quality advancement, which brings me to BenMedica. As Dave mentioned, BenMedica is a organization that we have known for a very long time and we have suddenly built the market for a long time. There are market leader across Chile, Columbia and Peru, in both healthcare benefits and medical delivery. And they have a really strong local management team with a proven track record in delivering very consistent high margin growth across both lines of their business and across all three of those countries. So similar to Brazil, we see a opportunity to create value by combining that strong local team and that strong platform with our enterprise capability, again across, clinical, technology and data and analytics. Transaction is currently in an open tender process and we would expect to close that yet this quarter. So pivoting then to our view of Latin America more broadly. We see really attractive healthcare dynamics and characterized by a growing demand for affordable private healthcare. And our acquisition of BenMedica will put us in a leading position in four of the largest economies across that region. Collectively, these countries have a population roughly equal to that of the U.S., but perhaps more growth opportunity in these emerging private healthcare markets, as well as a broader and longer term opportunity to serve the systems more holistically by also serving public markets. So we think we\u2019re really well positioned for the value creation over the long horizon and we are focused on bringing value to those markets.\nDavid Wichmann: So we took a little bit of time there, because you hadn\u2019t had the chance to discuss this at our investor conference. And of course, this came right on the hills of that as the DMG, which we\u2019ve already referred to earlier today. As it relates to the international markets, in particular, I just want to stress again that our approaches to those markets will be measured approach to deployment capital in those markets will be measured, and deeply respectful of the volatility that\u2019s inherent in each one of those. And our expectations are that they provide returns that are reflective of those risks and risk profiles that exist in each of those markets. Not to belabor this, but there was one other acquisition that we had closed, The Advisory Board that I might just ask Larry Renfro to make a few comments on as well. Thanks.\nLarry Renfro: So A. J., I know this would be something important to you, The Advisory Board where you closed, I think it was in the latter part of November. So we\u2019re in the process of implementing the Optum playbook in terms of integration and alignment, but it\u2019s gone extremely well. Well received it in the marketplace. And we really believe that this is going to enhance our sales pipeline, as well as our sales for 2018. It\u2019s very, very complementary business and their management team is strong and it\u2019s so complementary to us. We\u2019re looking for a lot of good things out of The Advisory Board.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Rigg: Actually just had a follow-up on the international and global strategy. When we think about at least South America, do you think overtime this becomes one cross-border enterprise under a unified brand name, or is it a portfolio approach where you\u2019ll continue to run both businesses separately for the long-term? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Just like North America, South America is an inherently local market. And so in that regard at least for the time being, we have two very strong or three very strong brands now in Brazil, both Amil and Am\u00e9ricas M\u00e9dicos Servi\u00e7os and then in Chile, Colombia and Peru, predominantly Chile, BenMedica is the holding company. But they also operate with a series of very recognizable local brand names, both in healthcare delivery as well as healthcare insurance. So I think you will continue to see that posture. To the extent that we need to clarify that like we\u2019ve been doing with some branding activity in Brazil this past year, we will do so. But for the most part we\u2019re deeply respectful of the brand value that these folks have created overtime.\nOperator: And the next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: So wanted to talk a little bit about med stuff, and I am curious what percentage of your book today has first dollar coverage. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about migration strategy going that one open enrollment period before the changes take effect for 2020? And I guess I am just curious on the economics of that switch. I assume the dollars are -- gross margin dollars are higher. But I would be curious if the returns are any better. And then lastly, do you think this is a big impact on the industry, i. e., a step function for MA in 2020 or do you think this is going to be more incremental? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: As you might suspect, a lot of the growth we\u2019ve seen MA comes from our Medicare supplement products overall. But I would ask Brian Thompson maybe to more specifically respond to your question.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, Dave. Good morning, -- thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the last point. I don't see this as a big transformative change. We\u2019ve seen this and been aware of this change. [Audio Gap] for some years now. We have the vast majority of our business today in first dollar coverage, but have been very pleased with our introduction of what we call the Plan G in the middle of 2017 and we are certainly seeing that resonate in the marketplace. But actually in terms of the seniors' perspective, we like the continuation and really the collision of both the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare supplement products in the marketplace really provide broad, good choice for those that are choosing. And again as we're selling right now very pleased with the margins on both plans, I don't think there is much as to be differentiated in terms of economics of either. But certainly don't think this as a big move over the long-term.\nOperator: And the next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKevin Fischbeck: I wanted to go back to tax reform and the long-term sustainability of the benefit. I appreciate that facing change over the next year, so you have to watch and wait. I guess I start with United actually and actually almost literally wrote the book on pricing per membership. And although I guess competitors might decide to put that back in the benefits, you obviously don't have to follow a suite. And so I would think that would be largely -- how much of benefits you decided to keep versus not keep, so maybe you could give some perspective on that. And then is there any thoughts initially about where you think competition wise there might be more pressure within the business? I would think that most of the Optum businesses actually will probably have less pressure than the health plan businesses. But want to get your perspective on that?\nDavid Wichmann: So as it relates to the $400 million to $500 million, just again to reiterate, most of that is the combination of two things. One is the minimum MLR amount so that we would need to return to policyholders, if you will. And then, the second relates to the lower tax rate on the health insurance tax. So that is what I would characterize is more of a -- I hate to say, but more of a mechanical element, if you will, and returning those premium values to consumers. As it relates to sustainability, again, I would urge you to think about the tax reform affecting our cash flows and earnings, as in a bifurcated way. One is, as it relates to the services business, which -- and as well as all the unregulated aspects of UnitedHealthCare, which are substantive. Those components are the ones that we're retaining and investing, if you will. And then think about the other half or the other portions being that, which relates to the regulated entity, of which you can see a substantial dollar amount is being returned to the market. On top of that, we invest in managing healthcare costs better, as well as applying better services. And then on top of that, invest more fully in what I'll characterize as more substantive event or transformative change to improve the health system and improve our offerings broadly to the marketplace. So in our view, we believe it to be sustainable, because of the fact that we have such a substantive amount that's already been reverted back in premium values, plus the other changes that we\u2019ve outlined. So our intention is at this stage from this distance, which is it\u2019s pretty early on, that we\u2019ve made the right allocations if you will in determining how to best utilize this tax reform value.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Just want to ask a little bit about OptumRx, and it looks like the revenue growth accelerated -- year-to-year revenue growth accelerated sequentially and the OI accelerated pretty meaningfully the growth there sequentially. And anything you wanted to call out for us there.\nDavid Wichmann: Gary, I\u2019m not sure we got your question, it that was fairly broken. So if you could rephrase it please.\nGary Taylor: I was asking about OptumRx.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay. Thank you, much better.\nGary Taylor: And the question was, it looks like the revenue growth, year-to-year revenue growth, accelerated sequentially a fair amount than and the OI growth accelerate pretty substantially, sequentially as well. Just wondered if you could give us a little more color on that performance?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. I\u2019d ask John Prince, please.\nJohn Prince: In terms of the acceleration, I think the key driver of that is our strong increase in adjusted scripts. So if you look at our volume, which is driving our business, our adjusted scripts is up 5%. Our scripts are actually been accelerated all year long. So our script growth was the highest in Q4 versus any other quarter in the year. So that is really driven by the success we\u2019ve had in the market in terms of taking on new clients, winning new business and keeping our existing clients. And so that is the key driver from it. One other driver from it has also been the Specialty Pharmacy business. So we highlighted that at Investor Day that we\u2019ve been very successful in the specialty market, that\u2019s the market where you both plan with existing business and also compete in the open market. Our value story has been resonating. Our experience has been very solid, both for members and physicians. And so we\u2019ve been getting a lot of uptake in our specialty pharmacy business, that all has been driving our overall revenue growth. So very solid from the business standpoint.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for your question, Gary. We\u2019re going to pick up the pace here a little bit to try to get in this as many questions as possible. Next question please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: A little bit of time has passed and you\u2019ve had more time to think about the executive order and lack of individual mandate. Any updated thoughts on how disruptive you think that will or won\u2019t be, maybe have you had dialogue with small group. What\u2019s your sense for their appetite and maybe change their approach. And does that at all relate to your commentary on your call around enrolment being pulling back I guess in 1Q and coming back due to small group, I think. If you could flush that out as well. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: So I\u2019ll address the executive order and then I\u2019ll have Jeff Alter to talk about the market dynamics here in just a moment. So the executive order had three components to it, the one I think that has the most momentum or at least initial momentum is around the association how plans, but we also have HRA and short-term limited duration policy considerations as well. So what I think happening across all of these is that the administration is pursuing an expansion of products that are available to consumers and in an effort to lead to more participation. And I think that that also lead to more insurance market stability broadly. So we\u2019re supportive of that, of expanding the choice of the offerings that consumer has and continues have. And I think each and every one of these regulations are really geared in that way. So we\u2019re supportive of these efforts to improve choice and frankly provide access to lower cost alternatives because as you well know healthcare costs too much and consumers are seeking more affordable options. We\u2019re still reviewing the association health plan rules at this time and we\u2019re not going to speculate on the potential outcomes of regulatory matters. But I would remind you that we have significant experience and do offer association health plans today, primarily in our individual business and/or operate in markets like PEOs and others that have similar characteristics. What\u2019s important about these is they must be designed carefully in order to enhance coverage options and to ensure that they don\u2019t destabilize other aspects of the insurance market, like the small group market. So that\u2019s largely where our commentary will be aimed, is making sure that there is no unintended consequences of these. And then with respect to enrollment in the first quarter, Jeff, can you touch on that please.\nJeff Alter: As you saw, we had another strong quarter of growth at the end of 2017 and that makes a run of 13 consequence quarters of strong fully insured group growth. When you look at 2018, our outlook that is unchanged from our investor conference has a market dynamic that has the introduction, full introduction of the health insurer tax. And that\u2019s resulting in much higher premiums and quite frankly, much higher year-over-year increases for our clients. So with that in mind, we look at our very large one-one enrollment in our larger business. We continue to see small group growth and we believe that as the year paces, we will return to growth in that the remaining three quarters and continue our run of strong growth.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nZack Sopcak: Just wanted to ask quickly about your MedExpress Walgreens collocation highlight, I think you\u2019re at about 15 sites at your Investor Day. Curious how that\u2019s going and how you think about in your perspective what metrics you have to see or think about a broader rollout for United and Optum? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I know this has gotten a lot of attention here, in particular, over the course of the last week or so with some activity at the JP Morgan Conference. I want to keep this into context. We have about a dozen or so locations that we brought online throughout 2017 and that was really to see whether not a retail side of service in this case with Walgreens would be an attractive venue for care delivery. The results are not near final but we\u2019re hoping that our MedExpress surgical care model with an adjunct pharmacy performs as good or better than without meaning that we can provide more convenient service to consumers at a lower cost and with very, very high levels of quality as MedExpress had as reflected in their NPS scores from consumers. I also want to put into context in that and this is just part of developing an overall higher performing local health systems. So it just be one component that maybe nested inside a local care delivery market with ambulatory surgical capacities and house calls and things of that nature. This is the future health system that we see delivering considerable value to people. The other thing I just want to emphasize is that we\u2019ll evaluate other venues and partners as well. This is an exclusive to any one, in particular, our interests are being able to line as productively as possible with others in these local communities to see if we can deliver additional value to people.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.\nAna Gupte: So on the providing side of the house, wanted to see what your thoughts are on your organic strategy and M&A. And firstly on the build out of the Optum care into 35 and then into target 75 markets. What type of competition are you facing with either other plans or private equity or other health systems? And how do you become the acquirer of choice? Obviously, you did get the DaVita asset.\nDavid Wichmann: I think we\u2019re nicely positioned initially here, but we\u2019ve got a long ways to go. But I wonder if we -- over that for Andrew, Andrew Hayek\nAndrew Hayek: So first and foremost, we started this strategy to build out Optum care in high value ambulatory care networks several years ago. And so we\u2019re several years into the strategy. The addition of DMG is another step forward in that process. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity to combine with DMG. And I would also remind you that we\u2019re in the midst of an approval process that\u2019s underway. And the step forward for us allows us to combine DMG\u2019s outstanding clinicians, local leadership and national leadership. They\u2019ve achieved very strong results in Stars, clinical outcomes and patient experience. And our capabilities and our strategies are very complementary. We anticipate that many of DMG\u2019s capabilities will make Optum care stronger. Reciprocally, we believe we can add a lot of value to DMG. And by doing this, we enhance the value we provide into the markets we serve. More broadly, the markets that we are targeting and entering have been and remain competitive. We earn the right to partner with medical groups and IPA, and surgery centers and ambulatory care centers through value. But we need to demonstrate our ability to enhance clinical outcomes, the patient experience and reduce the overall cost of care. And that is true across Optum care in each component parts. So we earn that right to partner and we think as we continue to grow and enhance our capabilities, we become a more and more attractive partner. And now that we have the ability to combine various ambulatory care assets with the medical group and the IPA, we can address a broader spot of healthcare needs in the marketplace and become an even more attractive partner overtime.\nDavid Wichmann: So Ana, very good question, one of five key areas for growth in the future this one, very early stages. Again, it feels like we are assembling relatively quickly, but it's one thing to enter into the markets and other things to apply information, technology and really enable these health systems to be strong performers and make a difference on the cost and quality, consumers receive in those market. So more to come over the coming years on this strategy as we continue to roll it out. Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Morgan: For several quarters now, you called out the growth in the behavioral health services as one of your drivers of growth inside of OptumHealth. I was curious if you would give us any additional color on that growth area. What specific services, the in-patient out-patient and what in particular markets, is it more of a government or Medicaid product? And then wanted just a clarification, I think you said of surgical care affiliates 7% growth. And I want to confirm is that organic and then also if you could break out price versus volume? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Frank, thank you. That is a same-store growth rate as we described, but Andrew oversees all those businesses. Andrew Hayek?\nAndrew Hayek: I will start with SCA, so the 7% is our same-site net patient revenue growth, so that\u2019s how we measure organic growth at SCA for several years. And so that\u2019s the combination of volume and rate. Keeping in mind that a total joint replacement could take couple of hours and reimburse $20,000, pain injection could take 10 or 12 minutes and reimburse less than $1,000. So we use same-site revenue as the organic growth measure. And 7% is a very strong number, that\u2019s the high end of the range that we have grown over the past several years, and is a reflection of the cumulative impact of the strategy we pursue, partnering with health plans and medical groups and health systems, being very disciplined in shaping our portfolio, the right M&A as well as some strategic dispositions to make sure are in the right markets, focusing on high acuity procedures, ramping up total joints, cardiovascular, complex spine, et cetera. So we\u2019re very pleased with the 7% same-site growth rate. And as Dave -- as was mentioned in the script, we continue to grow our SCA portfolio. On behavioral health, we\u2019ve had strong performance across the board and that\u2019s including our medical expense, our ability to serve our consumers, including the growing needs in autism and substance abuse disorder. And so really we feel very good about our product and our presence. And we continue to ramp up and add external customers and grow in virtually each of the segments that we serve. So we feel very good about the behavioral, the trajectory we\u2019re on and the prospects for 2018.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.\nSarah James: Can you speak to the OptumCare ASC surgical trend environment? So how is the trajectory going this year versus in the past? Are you seeing consumerism impact total annual surgical demand, or is it just back-end loading and changing the location of service? And taking that one step further. Do your systems allow you to see impact of in-patient diversion for non-UHC members? In the past, you\u2019ve said that you could track this on the individual member basis on the insurance side. But I am wondering for the submarket of OptumCare\u2019s ASC, can you tell how much of that volume was diverted from in-patient or does this data and technology not currently exist with that?\nAndrew Hayek: I would say from a wide lens, stepping back that ASC environment, certainly fits into consumerism. And so over the past several years with rising membership and high deductible plans, consumers being more aware of various alternative sites of care and having more financial responsibility for the cost of their care; we study this; we hear it anecdotally; patients are asking more questions; are asking questions to their physician; and they are searching more. And when they do, the ASC environment for clinically appropriate procedures is at very attractive site; based on quality outcomes, based on the patient experience, we have a Net Promoter Score of 91, as well as the cost effectiveness; procedures in our setting of care are roughly half to less than half the price of the same procedure in a hospital environment. So we do fit very well into consumerism and we have some data as well as many, many anecdotes that affirm the consumerism does drive increasing interest in our sites. In terms of back-ended nature, the years have always been seasonal, that's due to the members and patients when they're at the end of the year and they have a deductible to spend. They would rather get the procedure done by the fourth quarter before the plans are reset. So there is nothing new or different about that trend. And then in terms of in-patient diversion or share of the market that we're receiving, we work with multiple plan partners to measure this in various ways. We have a number of pilots underway with multiple health plan partners to track this and do a better job of capturing the right, clinically appropriate procedures. We're making progress. We feel very good about it. And we're still in the very early days. There is still a lot of opportunity to think about higher acuity procedures, like total joint replacements, complex spine, cardiovascular procedures. So we're very optimistic about what the future holds.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.\nChristine Arnold: OptumInsight backlog $15 billion, uptick nicely in the quarter. And could you talk about the specific areas where you're really seeing traction in OptumInsight? And where that backlog is really building?\nEric Murphy: To your point, we added $2.4 billion to our backlog during 2017. In Larry's opening comments, we shared, that\u2019s 19% year-on-year growth. So we're pleased with that performance. We had a strong Q4 in terms of sales, which enabled us to achieve the $15 billion objective. For Q4 sales, the primary contributors to that backlog came through our state government business, as well as our ambulatory rev cycle business. In terms of the path forward, we take a very robust pipeline into 2018, which should help us achieve our $17 billion to $18 billion guidance that we provided to you during the Investor Conference.\nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.\nPeter Costa: My question is on your guidance. Well, I appreciate very much that your guidance changed only includes tax reform items, so that makes easier for us. But the fourth quarter looks like it was running ahead of your guidance. And the fact that you even called out the UHC was ahead of your own expectations in the fourth quarter. So why aren't there other changes to guidance going forward? Or does that imply that you're more comfortable at the top-end of the range now or were there some negative things that we should be thinking about that came into play during the quarter?\nDavid Wichmann: Well, Peter I think really what it's reflective of is we're maybe 45 days from the time that we had our investor conference and first led out the depth of our initial guidance. Overall, we're quite pleased with the performance of the company and how it's advanced to the balance of 2017 and how it's established itself nicely for 2018 and beyond. At this instance, we didn't think it was appropriate or necessary to reflect any additional guidance changes based upon the core performance of the business. Let us get through a quarter or two here and we'll reevaluate what our expectations are for 2018.\nPeter Costa: And what was the prior period development in the fourth quarter, if you don't mind?\nJohn Rex: I think it was $200 million.\nDavid Wichmann: So thank you Peter. To wrap up, in 2017, UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered quality products and services, practical innovation, a better consumer experience and increasing customer satisfaction. Financial performance was strong, marked first and foremost by distinguished and diversified growth, meeting or exceeding our outlook by virtually every measure, including revenue, cash flows and earnings. We have carried this momentum into 2018 and expect to continue to improve quality and MPS scores and build greater trust and loyalty, enabling continued growth for many years to come. Thank you for your interest today.\nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 17, 2017, which maybe accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the company\u2019s website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. This quarter, we are pleased to report continued broad-based growth and forward momentum for our diverse healthcare enterprise. In our sessions with you each quarter, it is both humbling and an honor particularly from this chair to represent the dedication, energy and work of the 260,000 women and men who comprised this company today. I have the privilege of witnessing their efforts up close as I work with our people across the globe and it is inspiring. Each day, our people leverage clinical insights, data and information, advanced technologies and a service minded culture to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. Having the opportunity to live this mission and witness its impact drives all of us. Over the past few decades, we have evolved as we have grown to serve more people and expanded our capabilities, but to us it often feels like we are just getting started. We see more opportunities to serve and to grow further in the next 10 years than ever before. We are focused on diversifying our business applying analytics and advanced technology to improve the use of information and better engage people and to improve the effectiveness of our businesses and ultimately the broad health system. We are raising our quality through rigorous net promoter disciplines leading to greater trust and loyalty. We are reducing healthcare costs to make healthcare more affordable advancing market leading innovations and simplifying the healthcare experience for consumers and care providers. The pace of growth of our organization that is achieved will be determined by how well we work with, perform for and serve others. The more we effectively serve the healthcare market\u2019s true needs, the more we will realize our full potential leading to predictable and consistent growth in revenues, earnings, cash flows and enterprise value. To that end, this morning we reported strong performance in the third quarter of 2017. We grew revenues by 9% to $50.3 billion and grew adjusted earnings by 23% to $2.66 per share. And we reported $7.5 billion in cash flows from operations and annualized return on shareholders\u2019 equity of 22.5% and a debt to total capital ratio of 38.2%, down nearly 900 basis points over last year. We now expect full year 2017 adjusted earnings to approach $10 per share. We expect this strong business momentum and performance to continue into 2018, 2019 and beyond driven by growth and service to our customers. In light, we will walk you through recent business trends in more detail beginning with Larry Renfro, our UnitedHealth Group Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Optum.\nLarry Renfro: Thank you, Dave. Optum\u2019s third quarter included continued growth, strong margin than earnings and further strategic advantage. Third quarter revenues grew nearly $2 billion to approach $23 billion, an 8.4% advance over last year. Optum\u2019s earnings from operations of $1.7 billion were again well-balanced with each segment producing double-digit percentage growth in operating earnings. A nearly 16% increase in Optum\u2019s earnings was driven by the combination of strong revenue growth, business expansion and strengthened operating margins for both OptumHealth and OptumRx and a steady 20% operating margin at OptumInsight. Overall, Optum\u2019s operating margin of 7.4% increased 70 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. OptumHealth grew revenues over 21% year-over-year as it expanded to serve approximately 9 million more consumers over the past year. OptumHealth has among the broadest reaches in healthcare directly serving 90 million consumers. Per capita revenue growth was again strong in the third quarter rising more than 9% versus last year as earnings from operations increased 27%. OptumHealth is supporting the U.S. Departments of Defense and Veteran Affairs by providing healthcare services and expertise. Earlier this year, the Defense Health Agency awarded Optum a 5-year agreement to support Military Health System\u2019s global advice service. Beginning in March 2018, our registered nursing staff will provide triage services, self-care advice, care coordination and general health advice to active members of military and their families, 24/7 via secure phone videoconference or web chat. In August, the Advisory Board and OptumInsight agreed to merge in a transaction we expect to close by the end of 2017. The Advisory Board has long been a distinctive leading provider of research, consulting and technology serving about 4,000 hospitals and health systems across the nation. We believe their outstanding team of independent healthcare experts can extend their work into payer services, life sciences and other healthcare arenas leveraging Optum\u2019s data analytics capabilities and the breadth of Optum\u2019s product offerings for our combined client base. We look forward to their team led by their Chief Executive, Robert Musslewhite joining OptumInsight. We were pleased this quarter to receive a multiyear award to serve the Triple-S Blue Cross Blue Shield Puerto Rico Health Plan managing its administrative and operational infrastructure. We expect our technology and capabilities in core operations. Transaction processing and connectivity will help Triple-S achieve its quality, satisfaction and cost ambitions. OptumInsight\u2019s revenue backlog has grown more than $1 billion so far this year reaching nearly $14 billion at third quarter\u2019s end. And earnings from operations grew 11.6% over last year\u2019s third quarter. At OptumRx, we fulfilled over 320 million adjusted scripts in the third quarter, growth of 12 million scripts over last year and consistent with our above market growth rate in 2017. Earnings from operations grew 11.3% over last year while revenues grew 4.7%. As we delivered substantial value and supply chain economics to our customers, OptumRx has positioned itself to compete as a market leader. We served the generic brands and specialty pharmacy needs of consumers in retail, mail and home infused delivery models. We have high customer retention and we have been awarded meaningful new pharmacy care service contracts, including the State of New Jersey beginning this January as well as a leading state Medicaid program beginning mid 2018 and ramping up to the course of the year. These complement growth from our health plan partners and from medium-sized and large employers in the commercial carve-out pharmacy market. We have strong momentum in specialty pharmacy, but we expect full year 2017 revenues to increase 20% over last year and growth momentum to continue into 2018. Our synchronized data driven approach to specialty pharmacy integrates pharmacy and medical engagement. We then drive customer satisfaction by delivering strong service and personalizing the patient\u2019s experience across the breadth of information channels they choose to use. Through these and other ways, Optum brings insights to help make health systems perform better. We recently formalized the way we present our distinctive data and analytics capabilities under the Optum IQ brand. The Optum IQ name sharpens our narrative by capturing the rich data and deep distinctive analytic capabilities embedded in the products and services we delivered to customers. Overall, at Optum, we remain relentless in pursuing organic growth, strong execution raising NPS, innovating and feeding and growing relationship. Now, let me turn it over to Steve Nelson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. Steve?\nSteve Nelson: Thank you, Larry. Like the Optum team, UnitedHealthcare is pleased to report strong performance across the business this quarter. At UnitedHealthcare, we continue to focus on a few critical priorities. The first is quality, which includes both clinical quality and the experience consumers and care providers have with us. We are gratified to see our NPS core is advancing with consumers and clients across our product lines and with providers. Next is our relentless focus on managing costs. As customers expect us to be good stewards of their financial resources, one example, 2017 is tracking to be the ninth consecutive year UnitedHealthcare\u2019s customers will experience fewer, inpatient hospital admissions per 1,000 people. Third is our partnership with Optum. We are further leveraging capabilities to improve performance and innovate for our customers and care providers, nowhere does our clinical engagement performed better than where it combines with the clinical delivery capabilities of OptumCare\u2019s local market ambulatory care practices. Consumers regularly give OptumCare practices NPS scores in the 70 to 90 range and for 2018, 100% of OptumCare Medicare Advantage patients will be in plans rated four stars or higher. Together, we are able to better serve the clinical needs of UnitedHealthcare patients with the higher quality, lower cost and improved customer experience. In turn, we strengthened Optum\u2019s practices through market leading growth, innovation and clinical insights all aimed at better serving people one at a time everyday. The fourth priority is what we refer to internally is distinction. It is how we describe the truly compelling experience we are creating for people across a variety of dimensions. This includes creating distinctive relationships with care delivery system partners and driving simplicity for consumers. On Rally, our consumer digital platform we added additional private health insurance plan selection capabilities this past quarter to help pick the best benefit plan for their needs taking into account their age, family status, health background and economics. Doing these things well leads to the final priority, I will discuss today, growth, where our innovative commercial benefits have grown with remarkable consistency and we have considerable long-term opportunities for substantial growth in the public and senior sectors. Nationally, there are about 85 million people representing 1 trillion in annual spending who do not benefit from managed care offerings. The majority of these people are served by unmanaged higher cost fee-for-service programs operated by federal and state authorities. These people will benefit from the insights and the progressive tools that effectively support coordinated patient treatment across all access points in the healthcare system. Seniors and Medicaid beneficiaries served through our more progressive care models see higher quality care, lower costs and improve value. We expect the growth for years to come as the market continues its steady shift from costly outdated programs to innovative approaches like those offered by UnitedHealthcare. In Medicare, our revenues of $16.3 billion grew more than 17% over last year. Over the past year, we added nearly 1 million people, 100,000 of them in just the last 3 months split evenly between Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement. We expect more Medicare growth in 2018 based on both the growing MA market and our unique value proposition, which offer stable products, a simple and personal experience and a distinctive culture. In 2018, our quality Star scores advance again. Approximately 85% of the seniors we serve will be enrolled in plans rated four stars or higher. The initial stars data for 2019 payment year once again show strong organic improvement, because our underlying plans are performing consistently at higher levels. We expect our final star ratings in 2019 payment year to approximate or exceed the high performing levels of 2018 supporting benefit value and better health outcomes for the seniors we serve and growth for our business in this important market. In community and state, third quarter revenues grew 12.8% over last year. Third quarter membership levels remain stable representing a year-over-year advance of nearly 600,000 people with the continuing favorable mix shift toward more complex health conditions and higher acuity programs, which is our strength. During the quarter, we went live with programs in Virginia and in October, the First Californians joined UnitedHealthcare under new Medi-Cal contracts in two counties. In addition, we are excited by our active pipeline of renewal and new business opportunities as states expand and diversify the populations they serve through managed Medicaid. Turning to UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, our commercial group full risk offering sustained momentum in a consistently competitive environment growing to serve 40,000 more people this quarter more than 0.5 million in the past 12 months and 1.1 million over the past 3 years. These results reflect improved experiences for consumers and predictable cost trend management for employers driven by a combination of innovative benefit designs and locally payer networks, all of which lead to rising retention and strong new business generation. We recently decided to enter the Northern Plain\u2019s health insurance markets, including Minnesota beginning in the second half of 2018. Our team in Minnesota is looking forward to serving our neighbors more fully in coming years. Taken as a whole, UnitedHealthcare grew revenues this quarter by $3.6 billion to $40.7 billion nearly 10% growth and earnings from operations of $2.4 billion in the quarter grew over 13% year-over-year. Now, I will turn the call over to John Rex for a financial review.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Steve. Across UnitedHealth Group in the third quarter, we delivered strong, well-balanced performance, with most principal businesses again posting revenue growth rate, up 10% or higher. Consolidated revenues of $50.3 billion for the quarter grew 8.7% over last year despite the ACA effects at UnitedHealthcare. Our consolidated earnings from operations exceeded $4 billion and our net earnings to shareholders of nearly $2.5 billion rose 26% year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted EPS rose nearly 23% to $2.66 per share. Medical costs have been well managed within our established outlook range, while trending modestly lower. The third quarter medical care ratio of 81.4% brought the year-to-date ratio to 82% would suggest we will be closer to the lower side of our full year 2017 outlook of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. The operating cost ratio ticked up 10 basis points sequentially to 14.7% in the third quarter due to the typical seasonally higher levels of operating expense as we prepare for on-boarding new growth in January. Overall, operating costs remain within the range of our expectations even as we see meaningful opportunities to improve our performance in this area. Cash flows from operations were $7.5 billion in the third quarter or 2.9x net income bringing the year-to-date adjusted figure to 1.6x net income. Third quarter cash flow was driven by strong underlying business performance, working capital management, the absence of an annual insurance tax payment in the quarter, and the annual receipt of payments from CMS that adjust rates to reflect member\u2019s medical conditions. Our strong performance enabled us to reduce our debt to total capital ratio to 38.2% at September 30. Since we acquired Catamaran 2 years ago, we have reduced this ratio by 11 percentage points even as we continue to expand our business portfolio and enhance shareholder value. Over that time, we created a unique, diverse and fully capable pharmacy care service business, continue to build on our OptumCare platform through the acquisition of urgent care, ambulatory surgical and local market physician practices, and distributed nearly $5 billion in dividends repurchasing $2.5 billion in stock. We have increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted net earnings and now expect to approach $10 per share. This would be a full year growth of 24% and strongly ahead of the original range of $9.30 to $9.60 per share as we communicated at last year\u2019s investor conference. Dave?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. Before I give a first look at 2018, let me touch briefly on the federal executive order from last week. We have a great deal of experience in the area covered in the order, short-term policies, association plans and expanded use of HRAs. We will be engaging with policymakers as the regulatory frameworks in these areas are developed over the next 60 to 120 days and hope to elaborate once the process has concluded. With regard to cost sharing reductions, you will recall that we have a very limited exchange presence, about 30,000 people in four states who are CSR eligible and we submitted plans for 2018 both with and without the CSR payments. Thus, we expect any impact to be extremely small. Now, to 2018 as you look at next year, it is important to keep several tailwinds and headwinds front of mind, themes, we have been consistent about over the last several quarters, continued growth, momentum and performance, particularly with customer retention as our NPS disciplines improve, increasingly effective capacities to manage and contain both medical and operating costs, the improving performance and capabilities of our modern operating technology and data analytics infrastructure and ongoing efforts to be strategic investors and thoughtful stewards of the capital you have entrusted to us. With regard to the headwinds, these remain largely around externalities centering on government programs, funding trends and taxes. On the latter, the return of the health insurance tax is the most meaningful. We and others have advocated strongly for the repeal or continued deferral of this tax. It ultimately increases cost to consumers through either increased premiums or benefit reductions and thus affects Medicare beneficiaries, individual policyholders, large and small businesses and Medicaid recipients. Absent the insurance tax reinstatement, we see our 2008 per share earnings squarely in our longstanding 13% to 16% long-term growth range. In 2018, the insurance tax would represent for us roughly $0.75 per share of comparative year-over-year earnings headwinds. That figure is composed of the rate increase in the tax itself, the effect of our market share gains in commercial and Medicare Advantage since 2016, and the accounting convention that creates a timing gap as it applies to commercial businesses. So as we look toward 2018, we see our per share adjusted earnings within a typically sized range with the top side of that range in line with the current market consensus for 2018 and we see an enterprise with strong momentum and a commitment to performing to its highest potential in 2018 and beyond. Before opening up for questions, there are a couple of things we would hope you take away from today\u2019s report. First, our businesses are performing well at all levels and particularly for those we serve. We expect to continue to do so in 2018. That performance continues to produce distinctive growth. Second, we have focused initiatives in numerous areas such as innovation, digital health, artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, NPS and advancing a consumer culture. The breadth of these initiatives reflects our restless and ambitious team, one determined to make a difference in healthcare serving one person at a time. Finally, we are a healthcare company rooted in our core competencies and delivered in benefits and services. Together, UnitedHealthcare and Optum offer distinctive competencies in clinical insight, technology and data and information. As we bring these key capabilities and distinctive value to clients, we are privileged to serve more people and we expect to continue strong growth for a long time. Our goal remains realizing the remarkable growth, service and social potential of this enterprise. We look forward to discussing all of this more with you in more detail at our investor conference in November. Thank you for your interest today. We will now open the floor to your questions, one question per person please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nPeter Costa: Good morning. I would like to ask you about 2019 Medicare Advantage plans we have seen good growth in your earnings from Medicare over the last few years. It looks like going into 2019, there is a lot more plans for pricing a little more competitively as well as growing geographically. You had great growth in 2018. Can you talk a little more specifically about what you are thinking having seen everybody else\u2019s plans now for growth in 2019?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Peter. And I appreciate you acknowledging our past growth, I think our team has done a very nice job in building this business and really setting the stage for our continued success in that area. Obviously, we are not commenting on the specifics of 2019, but we will give you some general sense of things. So, I will give it to Steve Nelson.\nSteve Nelson: Sure. I assume that question is about 2018.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, benefits plan probably.\nSteve Nelson: Peter, you said 2018.\nPeter Costa: 2018, sorry about that.\nSteve Nelson: Making sure, okay. A lot of work to do between now and \u201819 benefit plan because we are about two days into the selling season for Medicare Advantage and yes, tremendous growth. We have been really focused at UnitedHealthcare across all the businesses to really advance the idea that I mentioned earlier in my comments around distinction and with very key focus on some fundamental areas, substantial growth, advances in quality leveraging our Optum capabilities, managing our costs both administrative and clinical and nowhere has that, I think, shine through more brightly than our Medicare Advantage. So, I think it\u2019s great to have Brian Thompson, our CEO of Medicare shed some light on 2017 and kind of outlook for \u201818 as you kind of see things shaping up.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Peter, good morning. As far as 2017 goes, our performance continues to be very strong, what we are seeing aligns to our expectation. So that really sets the foundation for a robust optimistic outlook both for the industry at large as well as our performance inside 2018. I think what we are seeing as we look at the marketplace for 2018 is very stable benefits broadly, very few exits, very few closures, really great for this team here. I think that will enable continued advances in both popularity as well as the penetration for Medicare Advantage at large. Competitively, no big changes, generally speaking with respect to the competitive landscape, what we are seeing large, it aligns with our expectations. Our offerings in particular remain very strong, very stable, well-positioned for continued growth inside 2018 and we do expect to outpace the industry and growth in 2018.\nPeter Costa: I was hoping you give a little color on the group business versus the retail business as well as how you are getting past the health insurance fee?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Peter, with respect to group, obviously 2017 was one of our strongest years ever both in terms of retention and strong growth. I think it can be considered a bit of an anomaly, but certainly don\u2019t want to diminish what is setting up to be a very strong year inside 2018 as well, great growth again in terms of new customers as well as strong retention.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay. Thank you, Peter. Next question please.\nPeter Costa: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First, Dave, congrats on the new role. Secondly, just appreciate the commentary on 2018 very helpful. I think what I would like to try to delineate here is 2017 when they have one away you talked about it, I think your Investor Day, $0.25 tailwind, this year you are talking about it coming back is being a $0.75 headwind. I am just curious if there was a change in the way you passed it through in \u201817 versus as it came back in \u201818. And if you did, for instance, take lower net income target margins than any of your businesses, can you kind of flush that out for us a little bit and little color to background there? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question, Justin and appreciate your acknowledgment of the new role and our guidance on 2018. I will ask John Rex to respond to your question.\nJohnRex: Good morning, Justin. Maybe let me give a little more color on that. So, first when we talk about the $0.75 that\u2019s the sizing of the year-over-year earnings growth headwind that\u2019s created from the tax coming back in, I\u2019d say it\u2019s somewhat over two-thirds of that is the explicit 2018 earnings reduction impact that we feel from that, while really the remainder of that. So they are somewhat under one-third derives from that really the tail impact that we saw from our 2017 earnings. If I think about kind of the composition of that and how that breaks down on the 2018 end year I would say more than half of that derives from Medicare Advantage and the non-deductibility of the fee and the restroom commercial risk products. And then as you mentioned really the other part of that $0.75 is just the other side of the tail of the 2017 tailwind. So, that\u2019s really the way it breaks down and overview as we think about the \u201818 impact.\nDavid Wichmann: So, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Justin, we\u2019ll break this down greater at our upcoming investor conference, but we did recognize you would like to get some visibility on its components.\nJustin Lake: Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Next question, please.\nOperator: We will take the next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to flip over to Optum. On OptumInsight, backlog grew nicely, I think previously the target there had been in the $15 billion to $16 billion range to end the year you will need a pretty strong fourth quarter to get there. I wondered if that\u2019s still the view and then OptumInsight has also been running at very attractive margins kind of above the long-term target. Is that sustainable or maybe asked a different way? Are we looking for a kind of higher target range? Are you revising the range up or is there some reason why that might moderate back down into the 16% to 20% range? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks, Dave. Larry Renfro?\nLarryRenfro: Dave, it\u2019s Larry. Couple of comments and then I am going to ask Tim Wicks to talk a little bit about this from a financial standpoint and how he sees it in the CFO role and I will ask Eric Murphy to talk about it as the business lead on OptumInsight, but as I know you know the third quarter finished slightly ahead and I would say going into the fourth quarter this is historical for us in terms of what we expect OptumInsight to actually how they will perform in the fourth quarter and they are right in line with our expectation. I think Tim will probably talk a little bit about that we had a pretty large account that came in at the end of the third quarter last year that may have a little bit of impact on the number the way that you are looking at it, but overall I would say that the momentum is very strong and we feel confident in our expectations. So, Tim?\nTim Wicks: Great. Thank, Larry. Dave thanks for the questions. It\u2019s Tim Wicks. Good to talk to you. The question around backlog, I think it\u2019s really important to know that as we hit $13.9 billion this year, it was a really great, strong quarter of sequential growth of $500 million and was led by revenue cycle management, BPL and government businesses. And also I am just noting that number has grown $1.3 billion year-to-date. I would also want to note that it\u2019s important to understand that late in Q3 of 2016, we had a very large end-to-end sale that\u2019s now in implementation. So, a portion of that\u2019s rolled off, but since that time as I mentioned earlier, we have also added $1.3 billion of new sales into that number and the backlog number is now up 11% year-over-year. And I will turn it to Eric to talk about the pipeline.\nEric Murphy: Yes, thanks, Tim. Good morning, Dave. Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. In terms of the specific question you asked about our backlog and our expectations regarding Q4 and for the year, first I will start with \u2013 Q3 was absolutely in line with our expectations relative to our contribution to backlog. We come into Q4 with a very strong pipeline of active pursuits. So, we are very bullish on our ability to be able to achieve our objective as you stated a $15 billion to $16 billion of total backlog for 2017. We anticipate the contributions of that backlog in Q4 being concentrated around our inventory and acute revenue cycle management, where our pipeline is up 60% year-on-year. So, we anticipate a strong finish to Q4 into 2017.\nLarryRenfro: So, Dave, it\u2019s Larry, I want to take this back to Tim, because I don\u2019t believe he answered the margin question.\nTim Wicks: Great. Dave, first just to note, you had mentioned the margin at 20.7% for Q3. I think it\u2019s important to note, it\u2019s up 40 basis points from Q3 of 2016, so year-over-year a 40 basis point margin expansion than the same amount September year-to-date. Sequential margin expansion over just the last quarter has been 200 basis points, but as you think about that margin expansion just consistent with prior years, we anticipate being continued sequential margin expansion in Q4 and that\u2019s really driven by seasonality in the business whether it\u2019s perpetual sales or additional performance and incentive fee payments that we expect to see at the end of the year as well as Optum360 content sales and other technology and data and software sales. So, we expect this seasonality and we see it each year as we roll through the year and would expect the kind of Q4 seasonality that we have had previously, but not a real expectation to change our overall outlook to anything higher than what it is right now.\nDave Windley: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to share your comments around trend so far this year, how it\u2019s coming in what\u2019s been maybe you think that it\u2019s coming in towards the lower end of what you are looking for and if there is any impact of the hurricanes in Q3 and potentially in Q4?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Kevin. As in our prepared remarks, we said that our trend is expect to be less than 6%, so within the lower end of the 6% plus or minus 50 basis point range that we had provided at the investor conference last year. Overall, it\u2019s looking strong. Our team does a very nice job of containing healthcare costs, but let me ask Jeff Putnam, our Chief Financial Officer of UnitedHealthcare to add some details and then maybe I will make a few comments on the hurricanes.\nJeff Putnam: Thanks, Dave. Good morning, Kevin. I\u2019d like to start our medical cost trend reflects our efforts everyday that we do to manage costs and improve clinical quality on behalf of our customers and we are driving this in several ways through traditional focus on medical cost management initiatives, getting at the right level of care at the right place of service. We are also increasing the effectiveness of our clinical model with additional focus on those with the greatest need and getting them connected to the right care. And we are increasing the alignment of our provider partnerships leveraging data and aligning incentives. As Dave mentioned, we are talking about our \u2013 looking at our 2017 trend to be below 6%, but that\u2019s still within the lower half of our original range from a year ago and you have to defer a little color on where we are seeing it, overall unit cost continues to be the primary driver and we look at it by category. It\u2019s really broad-based. We are seeing trend shift slightly downward across all categories and then there isn\u2019t anything specific that I call out around that.\nDavid Wichmann: And then Kevin, as for the hurricanes, obviously it\u2019s been an unprecedented time period and it\u2019s been a really powerful and inspiring time to see how our employees have pulled together to help people that we serve and frankly their fellow employees as well in the communities broadly. I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank the countless women and men of our organization that gave so selflessly during this timeframe and continue to do so today. We invested heavily in the aftermath of these storms we provided financial relief for employees. We helped our customers get back on their feet. We worked with state leadership and we provided all kinds of financial assistance and in-kind services for the relief efforts in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. So, there is typically some level of utilization offset, but I want to remind you that in the case of Optum, there is also lost revenue from reduced utilization. These are significant markets for our OptumCare businesses and then we had of course a fair amount of direct damage to our business as well as the financial effects of all these relief efforts. So in the end, we didn\u2019t really pay a whole lot of attention to the financial impact if you will, but because that wasn\u2019t what was most important at the time, but in the end it ended up being not material to our overall performance.\nKevin Fischbeck: I guess, regarding the Q4 potential implications, I mean, if you are pointing to a lot of instructions going on and I think a lot of people are expecting how did that plan to accelerate costs Q4 volumes just to be seasonally stronger every year. Do you feel like you have got good visibility into that trend in Q4 that there is any disruption as far as claims processing or anything like that, that might create an issue for you one way or the other?\nDavid Wichmann: We believe we have good visibility to our business and we don\u2019t see disruption is affecting our Q4 results.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Kevin. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: Yes, thank you. Could you just talk to not necessarily looking for more numbers here on the question from Justin earlier regarding the\u2026\nDavid Wichmann: Matt, it\u2019s very difficult to hear you. You are breaking up, are you on\u2026?\nMatt Borsch: I am sorry, how about that? Is that better?\nDavid Wichmann: Much, much, thank you very much.\nMatt Borsch: Thank you. So, my question was picking up on the health insurer fee resumption. I am not necessarily looking for more numbers, but just sort of qualitatively you talked about more than \u2013 sorry more than half from MA and the two-thirds of the $0.75, so the rest of it presumably on the commercial side. Is that getting to the fact that in the small group market or where is it the commercial was not entirely a pass-through at least with respect perhaps to the tax grows up and has there been any change in the pricing environment that you are reflecting in the way that you are handling the health insurer fee relative to what you have done in the last few years?\nDavid Wichmann: I\u2019ll let John to respond.\nJohnRex: Yes. Matt, on the commercial side of that, that has to do just with the accounting convention on the commercial business in terms of the periods that one collects the tax and recognizes that and the period that one expenses it. So for any piece of business that\u2019s other than the January 1 renewal date, there is going to be some gap in the timing that occur. So, we had called out that one of the tailwinds in 2017 was the result of that.\nMatt Borsch: Right.\nJohnRex: That flips into a headwind for us in 2018, because we get the full expense recognition in 2018. So, that smoothes out over a few years, but it creates the thing or the 2-year variability.\nMatt Borsch: Got it. Thank you. If I could just sneak in one other question here, is there anything to read into the \u2013 or maybe you can just talk to any circumstances around the loss of that the 500,000 public sector account and does that reflect anything in the competitive environment for a self-funded business?\nDavid Wichmann: No, I will ask Jeff Alter to touch on it. It was a single account. There is nothing particularly unique about it other than we happen to lose this one and unfortunately so for, Jeff.\nJeffAlter: Yes, good morning Matt. As Dave said, I think you have to think of this account as a very unique circumstances extremely large account. We were honored to serve them well through a number of renewals. We see very disciplined in our pricing on both admin and the projection of that client\u2019s healthcare costs during this renewal. And unfortunately, we weren\u2019t chosen to continue to work with that client. I would say we remain focused in serving that client and their members really well during this run-out period and we hope to be in position to compete again the next time that client puts their business out for bid.\nMatt Borsch: Alright. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Matt. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nMichaelBaker: Yes, thanks. Just want to get some your perspective on the potential opportunity for more active management of state Medicaid formularies in light of the Massachusetts waiver that was filed?\nDavid Wichmann: I will ask John Prince to comment.\nJohn Prince: Good morning. This is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. Michael, in terms of the question around state Medicaid formularies, I am probably going to get into detail the specific Medicaid plan overall. We are very pleased to be very involved with Dave\u2019s. It\u2019s a very large business for us. We actually support state from fee-for-service Medicaid in terms of their design and plan. We also support a variety of managed care Medicaid plans in their design. I think most states are looking at different strategies to create more affordability for their customers. We have been very successful in that market working with states around designs that get out of affordability further ongoing plans beneficiaries as well as trying to become more consumer-oriented. I am not going to get into specifics on a given state, but overall, it\u2019s a very solid market, where people are very focused on value and experience.\nDavid Wichmann: Good question, Michael. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Actually, at this point, my important questions have been answered. So, I will just let you proceed. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Gary. Next question please.\nOperator: And we can go next to Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nChris Rigg: Good morning. I was just hoping to get a little more color on the increase in the favorable reserve development year-to-year? And then if you could give us any color on the relative performance in the business lines, commercial, Medicare and Medicaid? That will be great. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Well, I think our development is indicative of the cost containment efforts across our enterprise and we have \u2013 I will ask Jeff Putnam to comment on its components.\nJeff Putnam: Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, as Dave mentioned, we are working to control medical costs and improve quality. And our development this quarter reflects that as well as a modest change in claims processing timelines and both these, they take some time to mature and get their way into our claims data and reserving as we maintain a very consistent and tightly controlled process. And with this, when you step up and look at this, we are pleased with the overall accuracy and consistency of our reserving over time, especially when you look at $117 billion in medical spend last year and approaching $130 billion this year. By business as you know we don\u2019t break that out specifically, but I would offer that both our commercial and government businesses recorded favorable development this quarter.\nDavid Wichmann: And then maybe Steve Nelson can touch on overall performance.\nSteve Nelson: Sure. Hi, Chris. So, as I mentioned in my earlier comments really excited about the performance across all of our businesses. We are really well-positioned and we see a lot of opportunity. So, maybe I will just ask Dan Schumacher to comment broadly on, I think particularly of note is the strong performance we have had in fully insured and then maybe Austin Pittman could just share a little perspective on the Medicaid \u2013 managed Medicaid opportunity continues to be a strong growth opportunity for us.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Chris, to your question around performance in each of our businesses, we are performing from an earnings perspective in line with or better than our expectations. And probably within that, I would highlight to Steve Nelson\u2019s point, our commercial business is standing out a little bit. And that really is built on very strong growth foundations. So, we are doing well on the fully insured side. We have grown that over the last 3 years as we mentioned in the prepared remarks by 1.1 million lives and inside the year, we are doing better than what we had expected when we got together a year ago at the investor conference. So, really strong growth and underpinning that is some really potential efforts that we have made over the last several years to broaden our product portfolio so that we could pair that with highest performing positions and be able to create price points in our offering that can appeal to a broader spectrum all the way from our largest clients down to our smaller clients. And then I think also worth mentioning is some of the advances we have made in not only our clinical model and medical management, but our innovations around the consumer both our advocates on the phone as well as in our digital experiences and a lot of that is in partnership with very strong partnership with Optum. So, those are some of the things that are contributing to the strong commercial performance.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, thanks, Dan. I will just comment on the Medicaid market overall. It continues to be a very strong marketplace, very active. We are honored with recent new market wins in Virginia as well as in Missouri. We have had important renewals recently with Louisiana and Colorado, Arizona LTSS, so again really strong performance across the board I think in recognition of the value that we are bringing to our state partners. Because we look forward, we have got a very strong pipeline over 20 RFPs in-house. That pipeline is shaping up pretty heavily with a turn towards populations of very complex needs, which really plays to the strength of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We have carved out a very distinctive capability in serving those populations. So, again, it\u2019s a strong marketplace. I think states continue to look to manage Medicaid that deliver value in predictability and cost as well as importantly increasing the quality to the individuals that we serve. So, we are very, very bullish about the future of that marketplace. So, hopefully, you are getting a good sense of the consistency of the performance of the business across the board that we are referring to in our prepared remarks. I might add to that, that our international business, our global business has performed nicely year-over-year as well. Nice progression in particular coming from our colleagues down in the meal.\nChris Rigg: Thanks a lot.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, thanks. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. The theme of consumers on high deductible plans has been having an increasing impact on the industry in cost terms and I think United has the most work here understanding the dynamics\u2026.\nDavid Wichmann: Sarah, we are struggling to hear your question as well.\nSarah James: Sorry. So, the theme of consumers on the high deductible plans has been having an increasing impact on the industry in cost terms. And I think United has done the most work in understanding the dynamics of consumer behavior, deductibles and HFA balances. So, can you talk big picture where do you see high deductible plans going as a percent of the commercial market, what\u2019s the growth profile there and can you give us an idea of the cost trend differential or initial headwind to cost trends experience when a consumer moves to high deductible plans from a traditional commercial plan?\nDavid Wichmann: So, these plan designs have been heavily sought after and have been a key contributor to our growth in part because of our ability to offer an account like an HSA alongside them are in HRA as well. So, it\u2019s been a considerable growth category for us and it\u2019s expected to continue to rise, but evolve and become more modern with greater focus on tailoring products and networks to individual consumer needs whether they be individual policies or in the case of a group A\u2019s policies, the individuals inside those groups, but maybe I will have Jeff Alter provide some additional color on or Dan Schumacher.\nJeff Alter: Sure. Thanks, Dave. Good morning, Sarah. Just for context as you look at our portfolio across our self-funded and fully insured clients just a shade under 30% of our enrollment base is in consumer-directed offerings, a little less so in our fully insured offerings and a little more so inside of our self-funded offerings. And so we have seen some very nice take up in that over time as employers increasingly look to that as a vehicle to help continue to offer high-value benefits at a more reasonable price. In terms of sizing the delta as people step into initially into consumer directed and then what it does over time, I think obviously if that varies considerably based on where people set those attachment points and deductibles, but needless to say that there is a very, very meaningful first year benefit depending on how you structure it and we have seen improved performance on a trend basis relatively speaking over time in our high deductible offerings.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for your questions, Sarah. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nSheryl Skolnick: Thank you very much. So, forgive me, but I am going to make an observation here on, it is both comforting and remarkable in a positive way to note the consistency not only of the very strong results across the enterprise, but also the presentation and commentary and guidance and a brilliant debut, David and I don\u2019t say that for any reason other than must not be easy to come in front of all of us asking out the questions on your first earnings call and this is certainly a good way to start, but that consistency is important and the way I look at the company both in terms of the growth and in terms of the de-leveraging in the capital deployment which is where my question is going here. So, you have now returned to stellar ROE performance 22% plus, you\u2019ve got your debt to total capital under 30% at 38% presumably with the kind of growth you are talking about this year and next year there is more room and you have from what I see a multitude of opportunities, David is the keeper of the keys has been involved in so many of the acquisitions that the company has made and you are now sitting on top of the organization what\u2019s the next strategic direction in terms of capital deployment. I know the basic formula, but where are the interesting things that United needs to go and do whether it\u2019s internally or externally to take the company beyond where it is today?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for your kind remarks, Sheryl. I appreciate that. As you might suspect this transition was architected by Steve Hemsley in our board and they have done a fantastic job and I guess that should be no surprise to anyone. And thank you for your acknowledgment of the performance of the business. It does continue to advance quite nicely. All that said, we are not yet performing at our full potential and there is a lot of opportunity for this organization to continue to improve to better serve people to grow organically as well as deploy capital in ways that it has in the past with maybe a slight tilt in direction overall. As you know, we haven\u2019t invested in a significant health plan in nearly 8 years. We do, do some small plug-in acquisitions here and there and largely for the purpose to enter into a new market and/or to gain some kind of competency that allows us to better serve people more nationally. So, the vast majority of what you have seen from us in terms of focus on the UnitedHealthcare front has been to drive an organic growth agenda and then to push more globally. And when I talk about globally I mean selectively globally, we entered into Brazil, we felt that, that was a good market. It is turning out to \u2013 as it continues to evolve to in fact be a good market and we look forward to the day when the political climate and regulatory and economic climates of Brazil shape up. We think that, that will be a nice growth category for the middle class and as a result will lead to nice growth in our business. You probably saw that we extended that into some initial activities in Chile, Colombia and Peru through the pre-announced acquisition that\u2019s underway with the Medica. That is \u2013 the combination of those two give us the type of South American presence that we believe we can leverage to serve the people of South America and they in a broader way recognizing fully that not all markets are investible. So, global will be part of it, but I would say measured global investments. The more significant investments that we will make going forward particularly on the growth front will be through Optum as we have in the past. As John articulated in the prepared remarks, we have formed the pharmacy care services business, which frankly allowed us to have a foundation from which to reinvent that business if you will meaning bringing greater technological capacities, bringing our synchronization story and capacities there as well as also addressing some of the transparency issues that exists in that market overall. We believe we can add considerable innovative value to evolving that. Second of that would be are really where a lot of our investments are today is really in the healthcare delivery space, particularly in the ambulatory context across certain major markets in the United States. You have seen us move out on those obviously their smaller acquisitions, they may not show up as much, but the Optumcare business is one which we have grown nicely through local care practices establishing a foundation in urgent care, continuing to leverage our nurse at home capacities that came from the XLHealth acquisition dating back to 2011 I believe and \u201812 excuse me and then also the recent addition of our surgical capacities. So, Andrew Hayek and his team are continuing to build that business on an organic de novo as well as through the deployment of capital. And then I think, you will see us also move heavily in this area around technology and taking advantage of the vast assets that this company has in information and data leveraging that more distinctly like you have seen us with Rally, which was a pre-revenue company 3 years ago. Now, it\u2019s a distinctive consumer digital health capacity in the industry. We will continue to do the same on the healthcare delivery front as well as find ways to create greater value out of the data assets to better serve healthcare communities broadly. So, I\u2019d say those are the directions that we are headed with, so biased towards investing in Optum, but I would like to just underscore that our capital deployment philosophies will be consistent with what you have seen in the past. It\u2019s important for us to drive strong returns and liquidity for our shareholders. We will continue to see our dividend move to a market rate and we will be balanced about how we manage our debt positions as well.\nSheryl Skolnick: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for your questions. Next question, please.\nOperator: We will go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nAna Gupte: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask you about OptumRx and the clinical synchronization model that you have tied to medical membership up-sale and margins relative to what you are seeing now with the standalone providers like expressed having pressure retail same-store sales down and your thoughts about potential entry and your response to maybe Amazon coming in which is being speculated?\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, there is a lot there, Ana. I will ask John Prince to respond and maybe I will give you a few comments on Amazon at the end.\nJohn Prince: Sure. Thank you, Ana. It\u2019s John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. I will cover a couple of parts. So, I think the first part was around sync and the second one is just sort of the broader market and then lastly is entrance to Amazon and others. So, in terms of sync, our strategy hasn\u2019t changed. Our focus is around how you solve fundamental issues in healthcare, one is driving and that\u2019s the best net cost and pharmacy cost for our customers. The second one is how we improve the total cost in healthcare. And I think that is where we are differentiated in the market where with our capabilities at Optum, we are able to actually solve that total cost of healthcare. We had a earlier version of that in the market, the last 2 years. We have done with UnitedHealthcare with other health plans direct from markets. It\u2019s actually created a great value in the market. We are now pivoting that to a broader solution. So, we have a new version of sync which we are out in the market selling. It actually not only leverages the touch point of the phone call, how you actually saw borders in the healthcare, but we are actually very focused on what happens with the prescribing physicians, what happens in the doctor\u2019s office and how it can influence that. We are focused on our digital assets, which is where a lot of transactions happen in healthcare. And we are very focused on what happens in retail setting and have a lot of partnerships in that retail setting. So, we are taking things to the next level. In terms of the second question, which is on market pressure, at a broader level, I think the market is very active. I think it is very interested in the solution. We have actually had a really good selling season. We actually have had a lot of good wins to the market. And I think that shows that people are very interested in a new story around what drives value as well as what drives experience. And so I\u2019d say the market is very robust, very interested in value and that\u2019s actually to working out. So, we are going to end the season with a retention in the high 90s as well as a very strong selling season. So, I think we are in very good position in terms of looking at broader market. The last piece is let me cover Amazon in terms of the market. And I will frame that discussion from a broader context. So, as you look at what we are focused on from an OptumRx standpoint, we are focused on creating the next generations of pharmacy care models. And as part of that as I mentioned before, we are focused on total cost healthcare leverage and that model is also very focused on achieving a member\u2019s health and wellness goal on behalf of our clients. So, it\u2019s a very different model that really leverages clinical expertise and it\u2019s at the heart of what differentiates us in the market. As it relates to partners in the market, we are channel agonistic. So, our perspective is that we will meet a consumer where and how they want to be served. So, as you look at various retail partners, we are open to new distribution partners. We are willing to partner with anybody that drives value, decrease cost and also improves the consumer experience. So we are open to any partner out there that actually addressed that. Our history has been very effective. So today, we have deep relationships with CVS, with Walgreens and with other partners in the market and we are open to \u2013 we will continue those types of partnerships.\nDavid Wichmann: I think you addressed any commentary. I might say, I was really just going to talk broadly about partnerships. The business has done a nice job of partnering with the marketplace broadly in the past and in no time will that become more important than the future as well. So, we will continue to engage with innovative and thought leading organizations and seek to serve consumers better managing their healthcare needs in helping make health systems work better for everyone. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. I wanted to go back to MA. Can you help us think about typical margin profile in year one at MA versus rapid improvement, you have historically seen kind of into year two, when do you get that to sort of full mature margins and then help us think about any difference between that ramp for individual versus group? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Hi, Ralph. Yes, this is Brian Thompson. I won\u2019t get into the specifics. What I can share with you is obviously as we approach 2018, the return of the tax is the biggest headwind. The good news for us is our own internal advancements are really meaningfully helping us reduce that tax impact to those that we serve first and foremost is our quality advance, secondarily is the productivity and scale that we get from that growth. And then to your point, perhaps the biggest tailwind for us is that strong clinical engagement that we did in year one that we see come to fruition in year two. So, it\u2019s certainly the biggest momentum driver for us as we prepare for the return of the tax in 2018.\nRalph Giacobbe: And what about group versus individual?\nDavid Wichmann: It\u2019s very comparable.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Ralph. Next question please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nZack Sopcak: Thanks for the question. So, Dave in your opening comments, you touched briefly on the capital plans covered in the executive order. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit of color on the experience you had with those, were they meaningful and maybe it\u2019s hard to say at this point, but how margins may have historically been in those businesses versus those were typically accustomed to?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, thank you Zack, good question. I am going to ask \u2013 we do have considerable experience with short-term plans. I am going to ask Dan Schumacher to comment.\nDanSchumacher: Sure, thanks, Zack. Good morning. So, probably addressed the association as well as the short duration plan, so on the association front, the reality is we have got decades long experience in that. Actually, our individual business was founded on an association and we likewise support associations in our group business. All told, we have got about 300,000 members in association plans today. So we have got a lot of experience, the performance is strong and I would say generally in keeping with our broader portfolio. And so we will look forward to engaging the dialogue around how they could shape going forward. On the short duration policies, obviously, the regulation that came in on April 1 that reduced the amount of links of the plans has been challenging for the marketplace. And so we are excited to see that extended to the full year, because the reality is it provides a bridge for people in between coverage. It\u2019s a lot more affordable option. It provides very strong access and value to consumers. And the reality is before that regulation we saw incredible increase in the growth as the cost of exchange offerings have grown and it\u2019s been a bridge for people. So, we look to continue to support people as hopefully the duration of those plans gets extended.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for your question, Zack. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take that question from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChristine Arnold: Good morning. Thanks for putting me in. I think that we really haven\u2019t delved in as much detail as some of the other things as OptumHealth and recognizing that as a tailwind to your 10% to 15% top line target as well as your 8% to 10% margin target. How should we think about that business performing over the next couple of years in the context of that top line and margin assumption putting SCA aside? I know you are still investing a lot in that business. So, was that 8% to 10% margin something we should be thinking about near-term or should we think about that as a longer term target? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Maybe I will ask Tim to comment on the margin and then maybe Andrew can provide some comments about where we are headed with the business.\nTim Wicks: Sure, great. Thanks, Christine. So, as we think about the year today, reported margin grew 50 basis points year-over-year and 160 basis points sequentially driven by FDA. In addition, there was margin expansion from our care delivery businesses, HouseCalls and financial services as well and overall OptumHealth earnings grew 27% while we make strategic investments in the platform much as you represented. I think as you look at those investments, really important to think about that we make those investments in businesses that we have an intent to grow and those investments are designed to further improve that ability to grow and that\u2019s really evidenced even in this most recent reporting period around our revenue growth at OptumHealth of 21% year-over-year for the third quarter. I turn it over to Andrew to talk specifically about the areas of investment and market areas, where we are making those investments across platforms.\nAndrew Hayek: Thanks, Tim and thanks for the question, Christine. So, we are pleased to be at the higher end of our range of 8% to 10% margin in the third quarter. And as Tim mentioned, we continue to balance current profitability with making investments in future growth and some examples of those are investing to help transition physician groups from fee-for-service to value-based contracts, which does require an investment period. Second is investing to ramp up new contracts and as Larry mentioned in his prepared remarks, in our military and veterans segment as an example for contracts commencing in 2018. And thirdly is opening new MedExpress locations. And as you would imagine that requires an investment as each location ramps up to profitability. So given this, we expect our margin to continue to fluctuate over time and be in that range of 8% to 10%. We will continue to balance current profitability with investing and we were pleased with the 27% growth year-over-year in the quarter. There is strong performance across most of our businesses, local care delivery, HouseCalls, behavioral, financial services, consumer engagement. And so we were bullish on the business and we will continue to balance investing with current profitability.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. And Larry?\nLarry Renfro: So, Christine, it\u2019s Larry Renfro. I just want to make a couple of comments that one is kind of a commercial here on the military side, we have a new senior executive leader here by the name of General Patty Horoho. She has joined us about 5 months ago and she is leading the effort in the OptumHealth side of the military programs and I might ask \u2013 just ask her in a second to comment on a couple of the programs that are coming through on the military side. The other piece that I would add into this is that we have Optum360 that is part of our OptumInsight organization that utilizes OptumHealth as well in a lot its programs, especially when we do, do programs with major organizations that we have worked with on the West Coast and the East Coast. So that\u2019s tying in as well when you get to the physician groups and surgery centers and so forth. So, to keep it short, so Patty, would you mind just talking a little bit about what you are working on and give everybody a little [indiscernible].\nPatty Horoho: Thank you, Larry and good morning. I have the honor to join Optum about 6 months ago after 33 years of experience culminating as the 43rd U.S. Army Surgeon General. And what we have been able to do is really leverage and find ways to transform our healthcare system from one that treats diseases to one that promotes good health. And so two of our newest 5-year contracts kept in the September of this year, we began performing the medical disability event for military veterans on behalf of the Veterans Benefit Administration. And through this contract, we provide exams in 44 states in the District of Columbia. The second 5-year contract is the TRICARE Global Nurse Advice Line, where we will operate the Military Health System\u2019s Global Nurse Advice Line starting in 2018 and this is our frontline nurse advice care coordination line offered 24 hours a day utilizing telehealth capability to military service members, retirees and their families worldwide. And what I would just say is that this is just the beginning of our ability to serve our military, their families and our veterans and we are just getting started. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. So, I think you could take from that that our bench is deep and continues to get deeper. Welcome, General Horoho and thank you Christine for your comments.\nDavid Wichmann: So, I will wrap briefly with this. UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare are intently focused on fulfilling the healthcare needs of the people and customers we serve. As we had distinct tangible value to healthcare, we continue to grow at a sustainable market leading pace. We expect to continue this trajectory through the remainder of 2017 into 2018 and for the decade ahead. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at our investor conference in New York on November 28. Thank you for joining us and for your continued interest in our enterprise.\nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

And I'll be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 18, 2017, which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the Company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen Hemsley.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the halfway point of 2017, UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare continued to grow and perform strongly and we expect our performance momentum to carry forward through the balance of this year into 2018 and beyond. UnitedHealthcare has been a distinctive organic growth leader over the last seven years. During that same time Optum has emerged as the leading force for broadly enabling the healthcare industry with market leading data analytics and practical and innovative approaches to longstanding market challenges. These businesses are strong, stable, and exceptionally complementary to each other, growing and operating effectively while continuing to diversify naturally into adjacent healthcare markets. With a socially sensitive global healthcare market constantly challenged and changing we see UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare built for that environment. Adaptable and creative, focused on the people and customers we serve, working with others and playing our role in leading and supporting progressive change across health systems. One important constant is our commitment to mission and the quality of our work, the positive experience and value we drive on behalf of consumers and customers, and their cultural bonds of integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation, and accountable performance we seek to bring to everything we do. We are at home in the current environment. UnitedHealth Group is a different organization than we were just 10 years ago and you should expect us to be different still a decade from now. Society will continue to need and drive change in healthcare, we will continue to adapt and evolve with it and on behalf of it. We are committed to reaching the full potential that UnitedHealth Group has to offer, knowing the next 10 years hold more opportunity than the last 10, those who are committed to keep evolving, perform consistently, and deliver value.  To guide our progress we have a strong, deep, and restless leadership team in place which will continue to positively evolve and change as well. I'll turn to three of those leaders Dave Wichmann, Larry Renfro, and John Rex to take us through our second quarter earnings report. Dave?\nDavid S. Wichmann: Thank you, Steve. We enter the second half of 2017 in a strong position. UnitedHealth Group is serving more people more consistently with greater levels of measurable satisfaction than ever. We are reaching, helping, and staying connected to the people we are privileged to serve in more ways and through more channels both digitally and physically in the communities where we work. We are caring for more people, closing more gaps in care, and producing more savings and value for consumers and sponsors. We are partnering more deeply and impactfully with care providers in part because our nearly 25,000 OptumCare doctors are dedicated to serving patients affiliated with more than 80 payers across the nation including UnitedHealthcare. That experience helps us to think more broadly than most about topics like the application of technology to enhance the consumer experience, the use of data, analytics and data exchange, effective management of healthcare resources and evidence based protocols, and healthcare quality, consistency and payment models that better serve people and plan sponsors. Today we serve 139 million people globally including 126 million people in the United States. And we see UnitedHealth Group's U.S. and global market potential as with all practical limit at this early stage in the evolution of our company. Second quarter results followed things from our first quarter performance. In the second quarter the company produced strong and balanced revenue growth pacing to exceed the $200 billion mark this year. Medical costs were in line with expectations. Operating costs continued to be well contained. The company generated strong cash flows up 29% year-over-year as adjusted net earnings grew 26% over last year's second quarter to $2.46 per share.  For the first half of 2017 adjusted net earnings grew 28% year-over-year to $4.83 per share. UnitedHealthCare continued to deliver exceptional results in the second quarter. Excluding the individual market, UnitedHealthCare grew to serve 2.5 million more people year-over-year including 1.7 million more in the first half of 2017. This continues our consistent, multiyear organic growth performance across all three major businesses. This growth has been fueled by a long history of restless products and service innovation responding to and even sometimes driving market evolution. This focus towards innovation has advanced the data, information, and tools to support both individual efforts to achieve better health and system wide efforts to deliver better healthcare. A business model increasingly centered on serving the unique healthcare needs of consumers, we are performing in serving new populations such as group Medicare Advantage, people with complex conditions served by Medicaid programs in emerging markets like Brazil as well as in longstanding well established markets. Healthcare is essential to everyone, individually and to the quality and productivity of societies and we aim to serve it all in one way or another, one person at a time to the best of our abilities. A dedicated compassionate workforce of 260,000 people serving in local communities built on UnitedHealth Group values and singularly aimed at helping people live healthier lives and helping make our health system work better for everyone. They are led by a deep and stable UnitedHealthcare leadership team that has worked together for more than a decade. And finally our commitment to quality in everything we do, in advancing net promoter scores both strengthening customer and consumer retention and care provider relationships across all of our businesses.  In many ways we are still just getting started but you can see the momentum in our results. In the employer market our local group commercial business continues to grow organically month in and month out, virtually every month for almost three years. In the past 12 months we have grown to serve nearly 600,000 more people through full risk products in the employer group market. We are growing by consistently serving the health needs of this population at more affordable levels and with greater consistency in the quality of their experiences and the cost of their coverages. Across Medicare Advantage and Supplement UnitedHealthcare has grown to serve 935,000 more people in the past year with balanced growth in the individual senior market and the corporate retiree market. Our Medicare Advantage business continues to benefit from strong consumer retention reflecting senior's positive experience and the clear economic value of our offerings. In 2018 our distinctive product value and consumer experience should allow us to continue to grow as we expect to increase our overall Medicare Advantage market share in a growing Medicare Advantage market again next year. States continued to turn to the private sector to strengthen and modernize their Medicaid programs. We are implementing four new State awards this year in California, Missouri, Nebraska, and Virginia. We discussed dual special needs plans with you in our first quarter call and our revenues serving people through these plans grew 33% year-over-year in the second quarter. In total our community and state business served over 700,000 more people at June 30. Taken as a whole the UnitedHealthcare businesses grew revenues this quarter by $3.2 billion or nearly 9% to $40.8 billion despite forgoing over $1.8 billion in revenues from the ACA individual insurance market withdrawals and the health insurance tax moratorium. Earnings from operations exceeded $2.2 billion in the quarter growing 13.9% consistent with our top line growth rate in the quarter after considering the ACA items. Let me now turn it to Larry for his perspective on UnitedHealth Group's enterprise growth and an update on Optum. Larry? \nLarry C. Renfro: Thank you, Dave. Yesterday evening UnitedHealth Group was honored to announce the early renewal and extension of our distinctive and longstanding relationship serving seniors together with AARP. Our two organizations have a 20 year history of working together to serve seniors greatest needs and to advance health and healthcare in practical ways. Each of us believes there is no better collaborator for the work we do on behalf of those we serve. We expect the value of this relationship to grow further in the years ahead as we continue to implement shared ideas and innovations, to better serve Americans over age 50 as the growth of that population accelerates meaningfully. The AARP relationship is a good example of our leaders working at the enterprise level to develop broader, deeper relationships, strengthen customer experience through NPS disciplines, and drive strong sustained multi-year growth. Other examples abound receiving new awards as well as contract renewals and expansions serving State Medicaid programs, corporate Medicare Advantage awards, new and renewing pharmacy care services awards, and the Department of Defense engaging us to provide NurseLine and digital clinical support services to military health system beneficiaries. Or the work we are now doing for Merck and others in the life sciences domain to help understand the impact of their medicines in a value based contracting world. The breadth of that list should give you a sense of why this team shows a high level of optimism as we look ahead to the next decade. We serve deep end markets with significant unmet needs and we are working to better serve these customers by improving the economic value of our services consistently raising quality and innovating in ways that solve problems. These efforts are steadily driving net promoter scores higher. Turning specifically to Optum, second quarter revenues increased by $2 billion or 10% to $22.7 billion driven by strong organic growth even as OptumRx revenue growth rate was affected by its delivery of significant channel savings to customers and consumers. Optum\u2019s earnings from operations grew 20.5% to $1.5 billion as operating margins expanded 60 basis points over last year to 6.7%. All segments grew earnings by double-digit percentage rates in the second quarter. At OptumHealth we grew to serve 9 million more people in the past 12 months with per capita revenues growing about 13%. This is an important metric as we look towards future deepening our relationships with the consumer. Growth continues to be led by OptumCare business which grew revenues by more than 40% through the combination of strong organic growth and strategic business expansion. At OptumCare our goal is to create and operate the leading high value ambulatory care delivery system in the nation offering high quality, cost effective care to a full spectrum of payers and patients. We do this by empowering clinicians with data, insight, and workflow protocols that bring the best of Optum analytics to bare in settings where strong analytics directly impact people's lives for the better.  By improving patient value and satisfaction at the best sites of service for care delivery, helping people access care that is convenient, high quality and affordable, and by serving physician employees and partners giving them the tools and support they need to be great medical practitioners focused on the clinical needs of their patients and on growing their practices to serve more health plans and people.  The second quarter was our first full quarter with surgical care affiliates included in OptumCare's results. SCAs performance is slightly ahead of our expectations at this point. The SCA team continues to expand their business establishing six surgical outpatient facilities so far this year. We are working and accelerating pipeline of opportunities on aligning future development priorities with our overall OptumCare geographic market strategy. And the needs of consumers in our health plan customers. Like SCA the MedExpress portion of OptumCare continues to grow steadily. MedExpress opened 20 new neighborhood care centers in the first half of 2017 and is on pace to produce record growth while experimenting with alternative formats and approaches that could deliver even greater convenience and value to consumers. In the local market primary care business we were privileged this past quarter to expand with two exceptional market leading group practices in Indianapolis and Denver. We continue to align with the leading local medical groups who are committed to the idea that patients benefit significantly from deeper investment in proactive primary care services. Our doctors help patients achieve a healthier state and to do so with a favorable cost profile. We are more than five years into the OptumCare build out but we are still in the early stages. We remain focused on its steady development and see this business as a significant source of growth for the next 10 years and more. At OptumRx the revenue growth rate of 5% was well in line with expectations for 2017. Revenue yield per script was flat as we effectively passed supply chain improvements on to our customers. We continued to experience strong customer retention as large sophisticated buyers who value transparency are attracted to our data driven clinically integrated approach. These organizations are represented in a strong pipeline stemming from our healthcare transformation alliance relationship discussed in our last earnings call and our recent award to provide pharmacy care services to the State of New Jersey beginning next year. OptumRx fulfilled 322 million adjusted scripts in the second quarter, an increase of 5% over the last year. In 2018 we again expect to grow our adjusted script volume above the industry growth rate. OptumInsight continues its strong growth pace particularly in the payer and care provider markets with recent awards or late stage RFPs in the areas of data analytics, payment integrity, business services, revenue management, and clinical best practices. OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew 18.6% or $2.1 billion in the past 12 months with $800 million added in the first half of 2017 included $300 million in the second quarter. Stepping back Optum is positioned on the front edge of the major growth trends in the market helping the health system perform better for everyone. We use advanced technology, market leading health analytics, modern care delivery, data driven population health approaches, and distinctive pharmacy care services as a portfolio of capabilities that help our clients reduce cost and solve complex operational challenges on behalf of the people they serve. This unique position gives Optum a long runway for continued growth and we are further focusing our growth efforts to take advantage of the opportunities.  Now let me turn it over to John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you Larry. The strength of our two business platforms drove strong, consistent, well balanced results in the quarter. Five of the seven reporting businesses had revenue growth rates above 10% as consolidated revenues grew 7.7% surpassing 50 billion in a single quarter for the first time. Our consolidated earnings from operations exceeded 3.7 billion and our net earnings to shareholders grew 30% year-over-year to 2.3 billion in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EPS rose 26% to $2.46 per share. The second quarter medical care ratio of 82.2% brought our year-to-date care ratios to 82.3% putting us on track to be at or below the midpoint of our full year 2017 outlook of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Medical costs have been well managed and continue within our established outlook and market pricing across segments and products remains disciplined and rational. The operating cost ratio was 14.6% in the second quarter and 14.5% through the first six months.  For the full year we expect to be at or slightly above the midpoint of our 2017 full year outlook of 14.5% plus or minus 30 basis points. Due to the mixed impact of care provider expansions which carry disproportionately higher operating costs and which added about 80 basis points year-over-year to our consolidated operating cost ratio in the quarter. These mix changes signaled the continuing diversification of our revenues. Touching on capital for a moment, our Board increased our dividend payment rate by 20% to $3 per share annually at our June Board meet. And we expect to achieve a debt to total capital ratio of approximately 40% by the end of this current quarter, three months sooner than our previous outlook. Cash flows from operations through the first half of 2017 are solidly in line with our outlook and we continue to expect approximately 12 billion for the full year, an increase of 22.5% over last year. This morning we've increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted net earnings to a more narrow and higher range of $9.75 to $9.90 per share, prudently recognizing the strength in this quarter. We remain comfortable with the existing Street consensus view of third quarter adjusted net earnings per share. With full year 2017 adjusted EPS now expected to grow in the area of 22% of the midpoint we feel this is an appropriate stance at this point of the year. Steve. \nStephen J. Hemsley: Thank you, John. We recognize at this point in the year thoughts begin to shift to the year ahead. Consistent with our past practices we are not going to discuss 2018 in any depth this morning, it's simply too soon, and there is too much unknown at this point. But we can offer directionally suggests the fundamentals of our businesses remain strong and we feel positively about our ability to perform and grow in 2018. Like any year 2018 will have its share of headwinds and tailwinds. The tailwinds are largely organic and company specific. Among them we would include continuing growth momentum and performance particularly with customer retention as our focus on NPS improves, increasingly effective capabilities to manage and contain medical costs, the improving leverage of our operating infrastructure, and our continuing efforts to optimizing capital management, investment income, tax cost, and other areas. The headwinds are largely around externalities. National and state healthcare policies, funding trends, and taxes which we and you are all following closely. We respect the complexity of the social, economic, and political matters that are intertwined here and certainly at this stage in the national conversation speculation about any outcome here would just be that. So we approach each year determined to overcome headwinds and grow to our best potential given the diverse and complementary portfolio of businesses and capabilities we can deploy. For 2018 and beyond themes for us will center around continued broad based and diverse organic growth across our portfolio. Steady substantive advances in quality and NPS that will gain further momentum in 2018 and position us well for the future. But first focus on costs, to drive better product price points continued evolution of our products and services toward more consumer centric and market response of designs particularly in healthcare delivery and pharmacy care services, deeper larger relationships, market alliances, and other channel partnerships.  Advancements in the application of next generation technologies to drive better health outcomes, value and consumer experience at lower cost. And with capital capacities at full strength continued focus on thoughtful deployment of capital including expansion and diversification both domestically and globally and return of capital to shareholders through market rate dividends and measured levels of share repurchase. We will give you some initial direction on 2018 in our third quarter earnings call and the full review at our November 28th Investor Conference. We remain positive and constructive with respect to our organizations potential to better serve the health and well being of individuals and improve the health system overall. As we respond to these needs we will realize the remarkable growth potential of this enterprise and we thank you today for your interest. Our executive team is here in the room with us to answer your questions and please only one question per person, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the OptumCare business but first let me congratulate Andrew on the new role and then given the optimism on future growth here that was discussed, hoping you could put some numbers around the opportunity, maybe share with us the current revenue profile for 2017 that\u2019s expected here? And then where do you see the ultimate business opportunity in terms of the TAM as you continue to roll out your 75 target MSAs and then maybe share where you think is the sustainable growth rate for this segment of the business going forward? Thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Justin you seem to have captured all the appropriate themes maybe we'll have Larry start and then Andrew pick that up.\nLarry C. Renfro: Sure. Justin that's a good question and it\u2019s an appropriate question but I thought I might since we're going to talk about growth and maybe give you kind of a general view of growth across Optum for a second and then we\u2019ll get to Andrew but I'm going to ask some other people to talk about growth as well. I'm probably going to bring in Tim Wicks from a financial standpoint. And John Prince from a PBM standpoint and Eric from Optum360. But we\u2019ll lead off with Andrew in a second. There's really just some three areas of what I'd call metrics that we pay attention to when we are looking at our growth across Optum. Number one is are our sales pipeline and I think you hit that and again I'm talking about Optum in general. And our pipeline today is greater than $40 billion and it's a strong, strong pipeline and that's not including what I would call mega deals. This is excluding them but we have a very robust pipeline of about $40 billion.  Our sales year-to-date is around 23 billion and that 23 billion would compare to last year's sales in 2016 in total of about 30 billion. The year before at about 10 billion so you can see the growth that's taken place from an overall sales perspective. The third area on the metrics would be how we look at our backlog and Eric Murphy will talk about that in a second but it's up and I think I mentioned it in the script 19% and year-over-year about $2.1 billion. So as we have really kicked this year off and what we've done through the first six months has been very robust in all three of those areas. So let me switch over to Andrew and let Andrew talk specifically about what the question that you asked and then we're going to walk through some of the other growth areas as well. Andrew? \nAndrew Hayek: Thanks Larry, good morning Justin. So as you know we have a belief that there's a significant opportunity to improve the quality, the experience, and the cost of healthcare on a national basis creating value for patients and the marketplace. And the experience over the past several years has been that physicians can achieve outstanding results when empowered with the right analytics, tools, and support. And the market is asking for these kinds of models to improve the cost, quality of care. So our approach is to tailor our market presence based on the local factors in each market that we serve, leveraging primary care, urgent care, surgery centers, and house calls, leveraging technology and tools from across Optum to create value for our patients and for our care providers. We are building this in a multi payer manner serving all payers in the markets that we serve and we believe your question that the market potential is very significant, the depth of the issues resolving, the value we can create for patients into the marketplace is very significant, and we look forward to creating a business multiples of our current size. \nTim Wicks: Justin, it is Tim Wicks, let me jump in as well and talk about overall Optum revenues. So, overall total revenue and unaffiliated revenue growth were both in line with our expectations on the quarter. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together had double-digit unaffiliated revenue growth for the quarter as well. I would point also then to OptumRx and just want to clarify this work in the supply chain that we've been doing is translating into lower drug costs for consumers and customers and that really would translate then into lower external revenue for this quarter even though external scripts were up year-over-year. As you know we never apologized UHC's growth and UHC grew faster in the quarter which is obviously a positive impact to our revenue as well. So as we look at the quarter our revenue and product mix are on plan for yield. Total revenue and external revenue both in line with our expectations.\nJohn Prince: Justin, this is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. I just wanted to talk a little about OptumRx and how we are doing. We're halfway through the year. We are hitting our new business targets and we remain very confident about hitting our full year target. Our retention is very strong, we have renewal rates in the high 90's. As Larry mentioned in the script we're very honored about the award from the State of New Jersey. That deal actually brings us more than 700,000 new members. We see a broad trend that large, sophisticated buyers are very attracted to our pharmacy care services model, it is very differentiated in the market. We've had some other normal wins and we have a health plan wins and also we have renewed our health plan clients who are out too this year. We have several new wins through the healthcare transformation alliance which we announced last quarter. I would say overall we are very optimistic about OptumRx's compelling buyer proposition in the market, it is resonating well and we are seeing very good results. \nEric Murphy: Thanks John. Justin, Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. To Larry's point around regarding Optum360 as well as our backlog, regarding Optum360 we are in late stage assessments with four major delivery systems. Our qualified pipeline for Optum360 is up 60% year-over-year. The sales cycles in this side of the market as we've shared in the past are elongated and we're working diligently right now to improve the assessments that we do with our clients and prospects in this area to be able to get to value proposition discovery in the shorter period of time to generate results for these delivery systems. And then finally I would share we\u2019re bullish on where we land for the year regarding backlog of between $15 billion and $16 billion for 2017. \nStephen J. Hemsley: So that was more than you asked for Justin but a very fulsome answer so the next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nDavid Windley: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I will switch over to OptumRx, some recent comments that you made quantified the channel savings that you're making reference to this morning at savings I think on a PMP wide basis of about $1300. I also quantified $200 of medical, what I might call mock on savings or what I believe to be your evidence of the value of synchronization and I wondered if you could maybe elaborate on that and talk about where you think that $200 can go?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Sure. John, do you want to respond to that. \nJohn Prince: Sure. David, this is John Prince. I am not sure I followed all the math that you're doing but let me take it at a high level. I think you know I see at the high level happening and if you just look at our external client market is that our number of clients we serve is up, our number of scripts is up but actually the revenue is sort of flat on a per script basis and I think that is really what you see is that the value that we're doing really looking at net best cost for clients as we are delivering that. And I think that is also why our story is resonating in the market in terms of the value that we bring to our clients. What we're also seeing is that even though we're delivering that value our external product gross margin actually is up year-over-year.  So actually we're getting the margin online business was driven by that more volume. So we're actually getting greater margin on it but we're actually delivering that value back to the client. When we're going out into the market we're actually talking about not just the pharmacy cost but we're talking about total cost of care. So what you are seeing in the revenue here that\u2019s our story of the market around pharmacy cost but our real value story as you go to market is people looking at total cost of care. And so we actually have a story in the market which we're talking to that actually talks about how we save a client $11 to $16 per month as they talk about our full synchronized solution. And that is what our clients are receiving. In our UHC book about 30% of the clients have that synchronized value. We also do that on a direct basis and also with other partners in terms of other health plans that we served in the market. So, clearly we are seeing a very differentiated value that our clients are seeing in their trend.\nDavid Windley: So if I could just clarify so the point to the question was where can the $11 to $16 per member per month go?\nJohn Prince: Well the $11 to $16 goes back in terms of their total cost of healthcare, so it actually went forward to our number, actually the client would see that and the return it would give to them. \nStephen J. Hemsley: It was to the benefit of the client, our benefit is the retention of customers and the growth that we get.\nDavid Windley: Thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nKevin Fischbeck: Hey great, thanks. I wanted to ask a question on MA actually, maybe a two part question. First, given all the growth that you have there just want to make sure that the performance from margin across expectation is coming in line with how you had expected it this year? And I guess secondly you mentioned that you expect to gain share again next year, wanted to get a little more color on the purpose behind that because group MA went so far, is there anything you don't have that your competitors bids up for next year so I just want to know what gave you confidence in saying that you are going to gain share this early in the process? \nStephen J. Hemsley: Why don\u2019t we ask Steve Nelson kind of give you the broader themes and then Brian Thompson will fill in the rest. \nSteve Nelson: Thanks, Steve. Hey Kevin, this is Steve Nelson. Let me just talk a little bit about how we're thinking about growth and the positioning of UnitedHealthcare overall and because I think the themes are pretty consistent as we move to a specific Medicare Advantage conversation. But we've been very focused on a specific agenda trying to drive value, improve our quality, very focused on costs both medical and administrative that are really driving an agenda of what we call distinction, trying to innovate around our both our clinical experience and our service experience, driving improved NPS. We see that actually across our businesses but particularly in our MAPD business as well, driving more attention which I think is significantly contributing to the growth and also the inline performance we've seen this year on that growth. But also you just heard the Optum team talk about their robust capabilities as we bring those things into UnitedHealthcare. We continue to see that really resonating in the market across all of our businesses. And so we're really bringing this agenda of distinction to new populations whether we are talking about bringing populations into more populations with complex care, complex conditions into managed Medicaid or some of the emerging populations that we continue to see grow whether it's a D-SNP or group Medicare Advantages as you referenced. So really well positioned across all of these businesses but MA is a tremendous story so with that maybe just have Brian give some color about what we are seeing there early in this year. \nBrian Thompson: Steve, thank you. Kevin, good morning, this is Brian Thompson. For 2017 we are off to a very strong first half of the year on both service and support as well as our engagement with our new seniors that have chosen UnitedHealthcare. What we are seeing is aligning to our expectations, so we are not only pleased with what we're seeing in 2017 year-to-date but also our positioning as we look forward to 2018 and we have a very positive long-term outlook for the industry and for us specifically. We expect as you heard to continue to outperform the market in 2018 overall on MA balanced both in group and individual just as we did this year and the two years prior.  The return of the insurance fee will be the single largest headwind in 2018, it's return was assumed that our 2018 bid submissions but despite the return of the tax and program funding pressure there, we do intend to keep our benefit offerings as stable as possible and we intend to compliment our 2018 growth and product stability with advances in both quality and satisfaction. So our products will again be designed for high levels of retention. So on balance we are very optimistic, we are optimistic about our positioning both group and individual against the backdrop of an advancing very positive industry growth outlook for 2018.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Thank you next question. \nOperator: The next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. \nChris Rigg: Good morning. I just wanted to ask or get a little more color on the operating cost ratio and just to better understand the mix dynamics there and I guess most importantly I'm trying to determine whether is there an incremental investment spending in the number related to the provider side or is that all just mix at this point? Thanks. \nStephen J. Hemsley: John?\nJohn Rex: Yes, thanks. John Rex here, so when I talked about the 80 basis points of impact, that was truly just the mix impact, a higher proportion of really care delivery businesses in our revenue base and that's the impact that we're seeing in the business. So that is straight up the care delivery business expanding and growing and care delivery business somewhere now in kind of two thirds of the range of all of OptumHealth. There are always investments we're making across the businesses and certainly within our OCR this quarter there were plenty but our commitment to you is to always balance those and as we deliver our results by that point of segment the 80 basis points does not include investments that we make.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Excellent, next question please.\nOperator: We will go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.\nPeter Costa: Hi, thanks. You mentioned the impact of the health insurance will be coming back next year, if it does come back next year that turns into quite a price increase for the commercial planned staff to pay, more than most businesses are growing these days. So can you talk about what you're seeing employers do right now that counteract that rising cost in terms of what cost cutting measures are they putting in place and what cost cutting measures are you putting in place to help ameliorate the rate increase?\nStephen J. Hemsley: So, maybe Jeff Alter and Dan Schumacher can you kind of combine on that. \nJeff Alter: Sure, thanks Peter. Its Jeff Alter. You know a few years ago we put forth a very purposeful initiative to expand our portfolio of fully insured products which included broadening that portfolio to reach many different price points and then connecting those products with varying network structures. So we have a very robust product portfolio that allows our clients to adjust to increasing medical costs whether that\u2019s driven by pharmacy or driven by medical costs or driven by legislative and regulatory actions. So our clients have the ability to create five down opportunities or to change in complimenting their benefit strategies without having to change their carrier because of the proactive work we've done in our product portfolio particularly in our fully insured product portfolio.\nDan Schumacher: So I think variety of products and offerings and really focus on broad range of price points. \nPeter Costa: Is there anything in particular that's being picked up more than not.\nJeff Alter: You know I would say that there's far more interest in varying network constructs. One of the more popular choice has been the leveraging of our more than a decade old premium designation program where we use lot of the OptumInsight in analytics to determine the best providers, those that practice both first and foremost always quality but then efficiency. And so we've created network and product structures that drive people to those top tier doctors using either co-pay or co-insurance variations. It has become very popular because it helps our clients achieve the price points that are affordable for them but also given the comfort that people are getting better outcomes at a lower cost. And I think that's a real story of the integration of the UnitedHealthcare and in Optum to deliver meaningful value to a marketplace that first and foremost drives people to the best performing physicians. But overall achieves a price point for their sponsors. \nPeter Costa: Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel : Thanks, just had a question just on the tax rate. I know there's been a few discrete items this year so first, just if you have just an updated guidance for the tax rate this year and then what you would view as sort of a good sort of run rate, tax rate, looking out that we should be modeling for next year excluding obviously the return of the industry?\nStephen J. Hemsley: We're so we're going to not actually get into 2018 too much but John, do you want to respond?\nJohn Rex: Thanks Scott, John Rex here. I will speak to this year. So we're not updating our tax rate outlook for the year here. Let me just talk a little bit about within the quarter because we did speak about it last quarter also. So there is nothing unusual that I would spike out in the 2Q effective tax rate beyond normal exercise activity. So typically with the share purchase -- with stock based compensation accounting we're going to see more impact in the first half and the second half in terms of lowering that tax rate. So we\u2019d expect that to increase in the second half. In the first quarter we had really talked about half of the impact that we expected to be nonrecurring and that was really due to just an unusually large amount of stock option exercises. It was related in part to an older acquisition and so that was the piece we spiked out there. But I wouldn't spike out anything as unusual in this quarter's rate and we'd be at the still in that 32.5% zone. We\u2019d always try to do a little bit better than we can and that would be my aspiration but that\u2019s what it would be.\nScott Fidel : Okay, thanks.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Next question please.\nOperator: Next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hello everybody, I just maybe ask about capital deployment John, I think in your prepared remarks you're saying that you guys will hit your yearend target by the end of the third quarter for where you were hoping debt to cap would be. There's been a lot of discussion in the press about your potentially being involved in various M&A type of transactions supporting Optum, Reliant, Advisory Board, etc. I guess conceptually as you guys get to your debt to cap target do you -- is the M&A environment just so robust what you're seeing out there that your capital is going to continue to be mainly focus there, do you see an opportunity to maybe reestablish more actively the buyback program, give us some flavor for where you guys are thinking on capital deployment?\nStephen J. Hemsley: I think maybe Dave Wichmann would respond. \nDavid S. Wichmann: Sure A.J. Thank you for the question. Very thoughtful. So you're right that our ambitions are to achieve our 40% leverage ratio by the end of the third quarter and we think we stand a really good shot at getting there which should be one quarter early. John has done a very nice job in managing our capital structure and getting us into that position along with our team. As you know we don't discuss rumors and speculation about our M&A activity and we're certainly not going to start today. But I think as you know A.J. that M&A has been a critical part of the way in which this organization has identified new opportunities to serve more people and more market broadly. And those ambitions continue as Steve lined out in his concluding remarks in the opening remarks around those ambitions being both domestic as well as global. And really focused in the services category really continuing to support Optum's growth and diversification, establishing platforms like you saw with OptumCare which we believe will be strong growth performers for us for the next decade. And I could go on and list many more but I think you get the idea. So it is a core part of our emphasis.  As relates to share repurchase we continue with a consistent policy at this time whereby we are just trying to keep our share count level. And as I believe you saw in June we increased our dividend again to a rate of $3 per share which is a 20% increase in continuing with our ambitions of advancing our dividend to a market rate level. Thank you. \nStephen J. Hemsley: Next question please. \nOperator: We will go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about potential changes in tax rate and I understand it's very premature, we don't even have necessarily a real proposal from the Republicans but to the extent that you guys have thought about it, I'm curious what the impact on your tax rate is from the non-deductibility of the excess compensation, how you would think about the introduction add back? And then as I look about your tax rate sort of before the ACA, your tax rate today is running 400 to 500 basis points below where you were so, just trying to sort of level set the opportunity were there to be changes and maybe specifically on those two items that we know have the potential to change?\nStephen J. Hemsley: You know Josh we are really not going to try to get into themes that could affect 2018 outlook but we would really prefer to do that not in a peaceful way but in a more fulsome way when we can really talk about all the elements. The insurance tax is clearly if it has sustained a headwind influencing 2018 and its progress of data really effects the cost for consumers in both -- across the commercial Medicare and Medicaid markets, etc. And it's a factor in terms of market -- it is stabilizing factor in the marketplace both in its cost. So the return of the tax making would further destabilize the market which is already fragile. And make that market less affordable.  So we are we would clearly think that either repealing or deferring that would be a positive thing but as it relates to our actual workings with our 2018 outlook or tax rate and so forth we're just going to save those so that we can actually go through them with you in a more thoughtful way, in a more complete way, maybe to some extent in the third quarter but for sure at our Investor Conference. \nJoshua Raskin: Do I get a mulligan then Steve. \nStephen J. Hemsley: You do. Alright do you want a another.\nJoshua Raskin: I will pretend that didn\u2019t happen. So my next question would just be, we're talking about OptumHealth and OptumCare specifically. We're seeing a lot of discussion among competitors around growth in urgent care in ASC's, how would you describe the competitive landscape, are you seeing more and more supply of like services in the market and is that impacting OptumCare at all. \nStephen J. Hemsley: You know, I think we are but I think others are better qualified to respond to that. So, maybe Larry to begin and then Andrew.\nLarry C. Renfro: Okay, Josh the -- as you know when we put our program together, when we started OptumCare it was probably about 2012 when we brought the Optum business plan and so I would say we got out early in terms of how we were going to approach the market and how we were going to look at it from an investing standpoint or we would partner, we would contract, buy, build. So we had a lot of different strategies in terms of how we were going to really attack and put together our OptumCare program. So urgent care, care delivery, the surgery care, house calls, behavioral we have all of those programs in place and they are actually functioning extremely well. And I'm going to let Andrew talk about it but, the one thing I would say is we are early but we have an established platform. We didn't miss any boat here. We are out and we understand the marketplace and we are in the process of a evaluating many different organizations on how we say that they fit with us and we have a very robust opportunity that we are seeing in the marketplace. So with that I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Hayek: Thanks Larry and good morning Josh. So I would say the local markets remain competitive in different ways, in unique ways depending on the market structure. But as we look across our OptumCare platforms in physician groups, the SCA, MedExpress, house calls the distinctive capabilities that we have really created demand for what we have to offer in improving the quality, the cost, the experience, the care and improving the provider experience. And so I'd say is the market force has continued to push towards higher quality at more cost effective price points. The demand for a distinctive platform that can enable physicians and care providers to achieve better results, leveraging tools, and insight and other components of our platform the need for what we have to offer is growing. And we remain very bullish and optimistic around the opportunity to expand across the 75 markets to deepen our presence in the markets we currently serve. As Larry referenced we believe we\u2019re in the very early stages of this opportunity and again in many respects the increasing competition increases the demand for a distinctive platform which we have. \nStephen J. Hemsley: So maybe we could then give it to Dan because that really kind of the voice of demand in there. \nDan Schumacher: Sure, so Josh one thing I would just highlight is obviously when you look at our spend and the composition of it and how much of it orients to the acute setting. We've got so many surgical procedures and so forth that are happening in inpatient and outpatient hospital settings and the reality is we've seen for a long time an opportunity to really focus on the side of service, get them into places where we can drive better quality, frankly a better patient experience at a lower cost as Andrew has been talking about. And we do it in a couple of ways. Certainly we do it in terms of our approach to medical management, so looking at prior authorization and making sure that we're getting it into the right side of service on the front end before procedures are happening. We are also building it into the product designs as well so that we're putting incentives in there to make some of the transition from acute to ambulatory to really drive the kind of outcomes that we're looking for.  And more recently with the acquisition of SCA and our partnership there we are really leaning into that and investing in quality incentives for surgeons so that we can drive greater volumes into these less intensive settings and we're able to do frankly more acute procedures and more complicated procedures in that setting as well. So we see a lot of opportunity in it. We've got it in place in select markets today and we will be looking to expand that meaningfully over the course of this year and into next. So those are some of the things that we're doing around both the plan design, the medical management, as well as the incentives to put those three things together in alignment to drive those transitions from acute settings to ambulatory settings to drive better cost, value, and experience. Larry.\nLarry C. Renfro: I\u2019d just like to add one other aspect of the Optum business and that would be Optum360. Sometimes we forget that on the primary care side, the urgent care, and now what we're doing with surgery care across the board we have strategic relationships with a lot of the Optum360 clients that are actually involved with us in using those programs. And so we get caught up in terms of talking about how we're looking at our different programs in OptumCare mainly from a health plan standpoint when the Optum360 organizations are actively engaged with how we tie into them as well. So that's a whole other avenue of our business there.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks, good morning. You know, there has been headlines around States potentially tying Medicaid contracts to exchange participation. So just want to get your thoughts on that and then with procurements coming up, how concerned are you that States consider exchange participation even if not explicitly and how could that influence your views around reentering the exchange? Thanks. \nStephen J. Hemsley: Maybe, we'll have Austin begin to comment with respect to safe base to dead end.\nAustin Pittman: So I guess first and foremost these are really State by State discussions and not something that we're really going to comment broadly here and not going to speculate about that. I would say with regard to your second question we are constantly in conversations with our States on how to expand coverage for more people, particularly those with complex needs. A lot of the activity that we see both in renewal activity as well as new business certainly surrounds that which as we talked about before is a real area of distinction for the combination of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. So we're very positive, we look forward to continue to serve our States and find solutions, particularly get around these populations with very complex needs.\nStephen J. Hemsley: So we'll continue to work with State and so forth but I don't see anything that establishes what might be a trend with respect to tying these kinds of programs together. States have been I think very thoughtful about this to date so I think that's the best response we can offer at the moment. Next question. \nOperator: Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffrey. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. Stephen what we know now about Medicare market [indiscernible] could the market see a continuation of the 2% and then penetration increase that we saw in 2017 and long-term given the inherent value proposition at Medicare Advantage where do you think penetration is heading, with the potential market that is 50% MA? \nStephen J. Hemsley: Maybe I will have Steve respond to that but I think we've been pretty consistent in the past that we do expect that penetration to go forward and we do expect the MA market to mature and grow. \nSteve Nelson: Good morning Sarah, Steve Nelson. I agree with Steve's high level comments there. I have seen clearly in our experience we have seen tremendous growth in our Medicare Advantage and while that clearly we think is driven by some of the things that we uniquely bring to the market whether it's the stability or benefits, the product designs, the service, and the clinical models. But also in addition to that there's just a real strong overall value proposition with Medicare Advantage and we're seeing that not only just with the folks that we serve but as we talk to policy makers too there's really strong support for it. So you see a population that needs it, it serves them well. It drives down cost, the satisfaction is up, it's definitely growing, and so we think that's going to continue. And so we do think there's an opportunity to further advance the penetration of the Medicare Advantage, where it can go hard to tell but I don't think it's unreasonable to think about something north of -- considerably north of where we are, about 40% approaching 50%. It doesn't seem like a unreasonable idea to us, no. I would think that we would think that it could go 50% or better.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Next question please.\nOperator: We go next to Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, thank you and I'm going to ask a question that sort of asked before but just as you know had started with your comment but you've added 600,000 group commercial risk lives year-over-year I just wanted to understand I mean, you're obviously doing better than almost all your competitors, most of whom are seeing attrition on the group commercial risks. And I guess the question you described your pricing, I think John did as disciplined and rational which I'm not disputing, my question is, is this really just that you are producing a better medical cost outcome and so you can price lower than the market because a lot of this business you can correct me if I am wrong, it moves unpriced, sorry for the long question?\nStephen J. Hemsley: So I think that we started to get into this a little bit before when Jeff Alter was commenting, it is I think a function of many things of which cost structure is clearly part of it but its spectrum of products, the design, etc. So Jeff do you want to respond?\nJeff Alter: Sure, hey Matt. I guess I would try in my response to kind of a discussion of what's here. So I would say the market moves on value, it doesn't necessarily move on price. And we have been very purposeful across our product, our services, the focus on NPS has I think brought a much stronger value proposition to particularly the fully insured small growth market. Long-term disciplined pricing is a good thing and I think you're seeing the discipline that we had in the early stages of the ACA now coming back to us as a value play. Couple that with a very purposeful decision a number of years ago to broaden our product portfolio and to offer a much broader spectrum of network opportunities or choice for particularly our fully insured small group clients.  We also have undertaken a different view with our distribution community, our brokers and consultants, a more disciplined approach with them narrowing some of that distribution network to more favorite partners and giving them some added services. So one of the things that we've learned over the years that our brokers and our consultants in that marketplace seek to do business with those that make it easier for them to do business with. We've created again with the assistance of rally and our Optum partners a much easier way for our small business brokers to onboard clients with us, to make plan changes, to recommend using some of the OptumInsight analytics. The next logical moves for buy down so, you really have to look at the value we bring as opposed to the price of our product. I think it maps the answer to why our particularly our small group fully insured business has done well over the last few years. \nMatthew Borsch: Thank you. \nStephen J. Hemsley: Thank you, next question please?\nOperator: We go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. \nAna Gupte: Yes, thanks, good morning. On Optum you saw some really nice margin expansion on OptumHealth and OptumRx despite the mix shifting pressures you talked about on providers. I was just wondering if this is an area of focus for the organization or this is one off and where could the margins shake out by business line and overall?\nStephen J. Hemsley: Larry, maybe you want to respond to that, clearly an area of focus right.\nLarry C. Renfro: It is an area of focus and Ana we\u2019re obviously you're looking at both from a financial perspective as well from a margin perspective and all that is in line with our expectations. I am going to ask Tim to Tim Wicks to comment on this.\nTim Wicks: Sure, thanks Ana. First, as we think about the margin growth that we're seeing since we had -- we\u2019re pleased to start a very strong start to the year 2017. The earnings are in line with our expectations June year-to-date and comprise about 40% of the full year expectations and so right in line with both our prior several years of experience in the first half of the year as well as our 2017 guidance. I think it's also important to understand that there's seasonality in our businesses and maybe I'll just point two examples where there's some seasonality. One, is in OptumInsight, as you know the second half of the year is typically pretty strong and in terms of the relative distribution of earnings growth in the year and it's really driven by several other businesses in OptumInsight quality and the risk businesses, the Optum360 content sales as well as technology data and software sales.  The second example I would use is in OptumHealth as well is when we look at OptumHealth SCA volume is characteristically also stronger in the second half of the year. And then typically we expect fourth quarter overall for Optum to be stronger than the third quarter as well as we go through the year.\nStephen J. Hemsley: Thank you. We\u2019ll do two more questions and then we'll have to close it. So, we will do two more questions first. \nOperator: We'll go to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nSheryl Skolnick: Thank you very much for keeping me in. So I'll just observe that if this is early stage growth for $200 billion revenue run rate company to produce what you're producing I'd like to see what late stage looks like. So thank you for that but, the real question I have here is that I've learned overtime to pay close attention to what is said on this call and one of the things that you mentioned Steve early on in your remarks was that words to the effect of it is now time to turn our attention to cost. In the past when you've turned the organization's attention to something its resulted in significant advances for the business enterprise as a whole and I'm wondering if this is one of those things that we should be paying attention to, and if so if you can quantify it in any way or qualify it in any way to give us a sense of where the opportunities are, I know we've discussed it from the OptumCare perspective but, more broadly across the enterprise would be helpful? Thank you. \nStephen J. Hemsley: I'm not sure I can offer you too much specifics but that was intentional. I think that in general if you take a look at our organization we have grown well over the last couple of years. We've been able to add some and introduce some strong companies into our portfolio. And I think that if you see the growth and in essence the net productivity out of that you\u2019d sit back and say there's an opportunity to strengthen the enterprise, continue to lead the enterprise focused on the things that are most important. And if you recognize the value equation as its played out in the marketplace many of today's themes were around retention of customers, value to customers, and so forth. As one of the questioners pointed out, the price point is a very important part of this. We have to challenge ourselves to deliver value all the time. We're in a very strong position, this is a great time to be taking that challenge up and that is what we're focused on.  We think we can deliver more value, we think we can drive more innovation, fresh approaches, and I think this enterprises folks who are ready to do that. The alignment of new technologies to that effort, use of more advanced data analytics produce a lot of opportunity for us particularly just given the set up of our businesses. So those are the themes around that and we are focused on our marketplace that's going to be looking for value and think that we can anticipate that. I think NPS is a big part of that effort as well. Thank you for the question. Next, last question please \nOperator: And we'll go to Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nZack Sopcak: Hey good morning, thank you. I wanted to ask about CMS\u2019s proposal to remove knee arthroplasty from the in-patient only list. Was that something that you considered happening in the near term when you are in the stages of acquiring SCA and how do you think about the impact of that business over a longer term, is it meaningful and does that have any impact on your MA strategy going forward?\nAndrew Hayek: It\u2019s Andrew. I'd offer a couple comments here. From an SCA perspective the team there has been focusing on higher acuity procedures for several years in orthopedics, in spine, in cardiovascular and that includes total joint replacements which the SCA team has been performing on a commercial basis for a number of years with outstanding results. Very consistent with the AAA in terms of the quality outcomes, the patient experience, and of course material cost savings. So we've been applying that in the commercial environment and there's been discussion for a number of years at the CMS level around the potential to allow total joint replacement in the surgery center setting which we of course would embrace allowing us to extend the benefits of that platform in terms of quality experience and obviously reducing total cost and extend that to the Medicare population. So in many ways we have been anticipating this. This is something on a commercial basis we've been doing. We can obviously speculate as to how -- what the outcome will be but this is a positive and consistent with the strategy we've been pursuing.\nStephen J. Hemsley: So thank you. Thank you once again for your interest in our progress today. Kind of midway through the year our performance and momentum remain strong. We expect to continue to deliver higher quality and value in healthcare and sustainable growth throughout 2017, 2018 and the years to come. Our thanks to our people who through their commitment to our mission and culture are helping to drive our enterprise to reach its full potential. Thank you and that concludes our call today. \nOperator: This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 1, "year": 2017, "date": "2017-04-18 15:30:07", "content": "Executives: Stephen Hemsley - CEO Larry Renfro - CEO and Vice Chairman, UnitedHealth Group and CEO, Optum Dave Wichmann - President Austin Pittman - CEO, UnitedHealthcare Community & State Division Dan Schumacher - CFO, UnitedHealthcare Steve Nelson - CEO, UnitedHealthcare, Medicare & Retirement Division Brian Thompson - CFO UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement Tim Wicks - CFO of Optum Dirk McMahon - EVP of Enterprise Operations Andrew Hayek - SCA, Chairman and CEO Eric Murphy - CEO of OptumInsight\nAnalysts: Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities Dave Wimbley - Jefferies Josh Raskin - Barclays Scott Sidell - Credit Suisse Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch A.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the Company's Investor page, at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 18, 2017, which may be accessed from the investors\u2019 page of the Company's Web site. I would like now to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.\nStephen Hemsley: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2017 begins with stronger than expected revenue growth, reflecting improved customer retention and broad based growth across UnitedHealth Group. This in turn was driven by our consistent focus on customer value, fundamental execution and net promoter scores. We remain optimistic about 2017, and accordingly, we are modestly strengthening our revenue, earnings and cash flow outlooks. Considerable national attention over the past three months is focused on U. S. healthcare and tax policies, so we\u2019ll begin with some brief commentary there this morning. We have engaged with elected officials from both parties, and at the federal and state levels, to address improving quality, access, affordability, cost and satisfaction for all stakeholders. Affordability can be improved most in the immediate term through lower taxes, and we hope Congress acts soon to permanently repeal the health insurance tax, before it further worsens consumers' premiums, state budgets and senior benefits. We have no insight as to whether that will or will not occur, and accordingly, our plans continue to assume the tax will return in 2018, which will raise premiums and/or reduce benefits for commercial businesses, state and our nation's senior population. In the longer-term, policy changes that improve healthcare and the health system play to our strength. UnitedHealthcare delivers modern, innovative, high performing network based health benefits with market leading capabilities and consumer engagement, value based reimbursement, network architecture and clinical management. We tailor these capabilities to address the needs of programs of every type and the consumers they serve. Optum\u2019s customers seek better data and analytics to improve decision making in the doctor's office, in the ER and acute care settings, at points of consumer engagement and on payer and employer desktops. As an open market integrator, Optum uniquely serves across all payers and care providers. Optum's own comprehensive clinical care delivery services have a highly compelling quality and cost profile. And Optum offers pharmacy care that integrates with Medical Care to support a whole person's clinical experience. This UnitedHealth Group portfolio is flexible, adaptable, innovative and positioned to contribute constructably to virtually any change agenda. We will continue to serve and grow through the changes that follow evolving social policy. A core part of that adaptability is, we continue to broaden and strengthen our leadership team by developing executive talent. We routinely give proven leaders new challenges that deepen their experiences and skill-sets. UnitedHealth Group has a tradition of developing leaders in this way and doing so when our businesses are performing well, which is the best time for change. In this day, we will highlight for you some of our most recent actions. UnitedHealthcare's executive leadership team has performed exceptionally well over the past few years. We have made a few changes to evolve that team; Steve Nelson will step forward as UnitedHealthcare's overall CEO and Dan Schumacher will serve as President; Brian Thompson, Medicare and Retirement's CFO for the last several years becomes its CEO. This UnitedHealthcare leadership team, anchored by Jeff Alter, Austin Pittman, Dan and Steve for the last several years will continue to operate as one team. They are committed to accelerating UnitedHealthcare efforts to drive growth and deepen the quality and consistency of its performance and its relationships in serving all stakeholders. Optum's performance over the last five years under Larry Renfro leadership has been nothing short of exceptional. And we are laying the groundwork for even higher performance levels. Larry is evolving Optum's leadership team as well with Dirk McMahon, a 14-year UnitedHealth Group veteran serving as Optum's Operating President; John Prince is leading OptumRx; Eric Murphy, Optum's longstanding Chief Growth Officer, has assumed leadership of OptumInsight. And we\u2019re pleased to have Andrew Hayek, who have joined us by way of the SCA merger, assuming overall leadership for OptumHealth. Phil Miller has made the decision to spend less time on airplanes and more time with his family in Kansas City. And Mark Peer, who as CEO of OptumRx played a central role in leading the integration of OptumRx, has also decided to step back, take a well earned and deserved rest and pursue his own investment interests. We deeply appreciate their exceptional leadership in advancing Optum and the many contributions they have made. We'll now begin our first quarter performance review with UnitedHealth Group Vice Chairman and Optum CEO, Larry Renfro. Larry?\nLarry Renfro: Thank you, Steve. As you said, it\u2019s the right time to evolve our leadership team. Veteran leaders with new focus, new energies and high expectations working with a mission, from a platform like none other in healthcare. Across UnitedHealth Group, our team continues to deepen the disciplines of responsive service, consistent quality, innovation and relationship trust, all in the context of our mission and our culture. We have meaningfully advanced the net promoter system, NPS, across UnitedHealth Group and fully aligned our compensation systems with annual and long-term NPS goals. This year's first surveys of consumer NPS at UnitedHealthcare showed scores rising 4 points in each of our commercial, Medicare and retirement and community and state businesses. And Optum's results show strong satisfaction as well. The greatest value with this disciplines lies in the insights, NPS provides, enabling our people to design focused action plans to improve the consumer, client and care provider experience. Our enterprise-wide goal is ambitious. We are targeting a world class NPS of 70 within seven years, or 70 in seven. For us, NPS is both an operating and a growth metric, because our operational responses to customer needs increase trust, loyalty retention and reputation and these ultimately translate to growth. And our businesses are experiencing consistently higher customer retention. We are becoming adept in relationship and pipeline development and management, with a laser focus on our five high growth market for the enterprise. Those markets are technology enabled information and services, clinical care delivery, pharmacy care services, consumer centric benefits and global opportunities. Alone, each one of these areas represents a substantial opportunity to serve. And combined, they drive the next decade of growth for UnitedHealth Group. Turning to Optum's first quarter. We grew earnings from operations by $173 million year-over-year, a 16% earnings growth rate on revenue growth of $1.6 billion, virtually all organic. Operating margins expanded to 6% overall and earnings from operations grew year-over-year by double-digit percentages for each reporting segment. Strong first quarter operating metrics provide visibility into continued revenue growth in 2017. Compared to the first quarter of last year, OptumHealth grew to serve 6 million more people with average per capita revenues growing about 10%. OptumRx fulfilled 15 million more scripts, an above market 5% growth rate. And OptumInsight\u2019s revenue backlog grew 19% or $2.1 billion in the past 12 months with more than $1.5 billion added in the first quarter. First quarter activity included the completion of our merger with Surgical Care Affiliates, a strategic addition to our OptumCare platform. SCA and its strong leadership team, an outstanding workforce, move us one more step toward creating the next generation of healthcare delivery. Clinical care, i. e. community focused, high quality, consumer friendly and cost efficient. Today, we serve patients as an in-network care provider on behalf of more than 80 payers. We offer urgent care at nearly 250 neighborhood care centers, primary care through local medical practices in nearly 30 markets with 22,000 dedicated physicians; house calls 1.3 million home visits this year performed by 1,700 skilled certified nurse practitioners; complex care management services, both in home and in nursing facilities; and now, high quality consumer and clinically differentiated surgeries in 33 states and more than 200 convenient free-standing surgical centers with top flight medical partners in local health communities. When we align and integrate enriched patient level data and applied analytics with our own care delivery capabilities, we are better positioned to serve healthcare through more effective value based contracts on a multi-payer basis, and that holds true for those we partner with as well. This effort, when fully scaled, yields more consistent health outcomes, lower cost and greater convenience for patients and the health system as a whole. This will continue to evolve as we advance and connect these practices and patients and integrate their pharmacy and other ambulatory and acute services. We are just in the beginning phases of this multi-year effort. OptumRx was selected last month as a pharmacy care partnered by the Health Transformation Alliance, which represents Fortune 100 national employers. Proven OptimaRx capabilities in applying data and analytics to improve both pharmacy care and health care were important to earning new opportunity. We see the potential for multi-year growth through HTA, following a notable business award implemented in 2017 from several of the largest, most sophisticated customers in the market. Our health financial services capabilities continue to drive growth across channels, products and platforms as well. The nation's second largest retirement plan administrator, Empower Retirement, named OptumHealth its exclusive partner for health savings accounts. Empower Health\u2019s people understand the direct connection between health and wealth, and is offering customers Optum\u2019s HSA\u2019s and digital tools to help retirees and active workers plan and save their future healthcare expenses. These examples further illustrate how we serve effectively and strategically interconnected businesses with platform level capabilities. It has been over five years since we began one Optum, an effort that built a robust and growing first generation information and technology enabled health services platform. Many of you have tracked Optum success in bringing a differentiated approach to helping customers better solve their complex problems. This year, our revenues are on pace to triple from 2011, and we are continuing efforts to align and integrate our businesses to position leadership, to build deeper relationships, and to focus on mission, culture and growth. Today, we are driving a second generations one Optum effort, to position Optum to truly enable a better performing healthcare system from the local community to national and global levels. Our first quarter demonstrates we are on track to achieve the strong level of results in 2017 [audio gap] we have discussed with you, and we plan to enter 2018 with considerable momentum. Now let me turn it over to Dave.\nDave Wichmann: Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare began the year with exceptional results. Outside the ACA individual market, the business grew to serve 2.5 million more people year-over-year and 1.5 million more people in the first three months of 2017. This continues a multi-year run of seven-figure membership growth. Performance that remains distinctive in the market year-after-year, an expectation we remain committed to for years to come. Our commitment to improving consumer value in healthcare drives us to continually improve healthcare quality and lower healthcare cost. Medical cost remained well controlled, current year cost trends are running in line with our expectations. As you are all aware the health insurance tax was deferrred in 2017, reducing premiums for customers in 2017 and adding about 150 basis points year-over-year to our consolidated Medical Care ratio. Absent this impact, our first quarter Medical Care ratio improved, mostly due to our significantly reduced participation in ACA individual offerings. Our consistent focus and innovation around medical cost performance and consumer experience continue to drive customer loyalty, leading to higher retention and strengthen growth. Let's look at growth by business and product, starting with employer and individual. In commercial offerings, we grew to serve 480,000 more people in the first quarter, 225,000 through risk-based products and 255,000 through fee-based offerings. And as you are well aware, last year, we made the difficult decision to reposition our ACA individual offerings, given our views on the sustainability of that market segment. At the same time, we remained committed to working with states and federal policy-makers to find ways to offer these markets and the uninsured, more viable and sustainable health benefits. The year began strongly in the public and senior sector as well, with the number of people served increasing by more than 1 million in total, including more than 300,000 people in Medicaid and 675,000 people in Medicare Advantage, about half of which were in employer retiree programs. Consumers are responding to our strong and consistent quality, distinctive star ratings, clinical engagement, stable premiums and benefits and the service experience our employees deliver. Across the UnitedHealthcare, we are growing both through increased penetration and long-standing markets and through geographic expansion in Maricopa County, Arizona, in the Western slopes of Colorado and in Upstate New York, as examples. Our clinical engagement has been increasingly differentiated as we care for a greater mix of members with higher care needs. The Dual Eligible Special Needs, or D-SNP market is a good example. The dually eligible make up just 15% of the total Medicaid population, but they account for roughly 35% of the total Medicaid spending. This demand on healthcare resources reveals the need to deliver highly coordinated and integrated health and social solutions that improve consistency of access and care, decrease the use of unnecessary services and high cost settings, and ultimately reduce costs without diluting care. While these individuals\u2019 health needs are more complex, they have been historically served in unmanaged environments. Only 2 million of the dually eligible are currently enrolled in Managed Care, while nearly 9 million remain largely unmanaged in state-based fee for services systems. So far in 2017, we have entered into five new state markets and we expect to serve nearly 100,000 more dually eligible people in total of this year. UnitedHealthcare's core capabilities, aligned with serving individuals with complex needs, and helping them maintain their quality of life, which benefits the individuals, their families and the state and federal program sponsors tests with financing their care. By the end of this year, we expect to serve more than one quarter of the 2 million dual special need planned beneficiaries enrolled in Managed Care nationwide. We see D-SNP as a new and early stage market with great potential to grow by serving those with challenging needs. Last, on the subject of growth. More broadly, and as a reminder, while we continue to see real opportunity for growth, we are disciplined and firm about participating only in those markets that remain sustainable and we\u2019ll make the tough decisions to exists unsustainable markets, as demonstrated by recent exchange actions and selective Medicaid exists in the past. Taken as a whole, the UnitedHealthcare businesses grew revenues this quarter by $4.2 billion or 12% year-over-year to $40.1 billion. That is despite foregoing $1.6 billion in quarterly revenues or 5 percentage points of the year-over-year growth from the ACA insurance market withdrawals and the health insurance tax moratorium. Earnings from operations exceeded $2.1 billion in the quarter, growing 15% fully in line with our top line growth in the quarter. Bringing the quarter together on a consolidated basis, UnitedHealth Group grew revenues of nearly $49 billion, grew 9.4%. Consolidated earnings from operations were $3.4 billion and our net earnings to shareholders grew 35% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS rose 31% to $2.37 per share. Overall, we now expect 2017 revenues of approximately $200 billion and adjusted net earnings per share to be in a range from $9.65 to $9.85 per share. This is an increase of $0.30 per share from the midpoint of our outlook in January, partly from an improved tax rate in the area of 32.05% for the full year. The tax rate improvement is driven by a number of factors, about half of which are more discrete in nature, such as share based compensation and half, which we would expect to be more sustainable into the future. We expect our full year fully diluted share count to be approximately 980 million shares and we have increased our expectations for cash flows from operation to approximately $12 billion this year. With these considerations, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be largely consistent with the first quarter earnings we reported this morning. Steve?\nStephen Hemsley: Thank you, Dave. So we remain positive and constructive with respect to our organization\u2019s potential to better serve the health and well being of individuals and improve the health system overall; fulfilling our mission to help people live healthier lives and to make the heath system work better for everyone. In fully responding to the market needs we see every day, we\u2019ll realize the remarkable potential of this enterprise. And as we do that with consistent excellence and confidence, we will continue to experience diversified, balanced and consistent growth as we\u2019ve seen today. So thank you for your interest today and operator, let's turn to questions and again one question at a time. We\u2019ll try to get to all of them this morning.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to our first question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nPeter Costa: Thanks guys, lot of management changes there. Can you talk about if there is any reason why you're doing them now? And does it have anything to do with the selling season coming into 2018, going forward?\nStephen Hemsley: Peter, I don\u2019t really have anything to offer other than what we did. We develop and think about these changes in advance. We kind of evolve them in our organization. We do these things when things are really, I think in strong order. And I think our tradition has been to do these every two, between two years and three years. And we\u2019re excited about it, and I think it provides fresh new focus, a lot of energy. And we have a tremendous leadership team, great depth. So we have a lot of talent to choose from. And in many respects, we just, we move from one spot to another to broaden experience as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything more than we feel very comfortable taking these steps at this point in time.\nPeter Costa: And then so you're anticipating the 2018 selling season to be similar to the past seasons, or how you\u2019re factoring out?\nStephen Hemsley: We think pretty positively about 2018, at some challenges with respect to the health insurance tax as it sits right now. But as a total enterprise and our opportunities, I think you can see momentum growing in our business here for the last couple of years. And we expect that to carry through into 2018. So we do expect strong '18.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Dave Wimbley with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDave Wimbley: My question is a follow up on the last, which is on health insurer fee. By what point would you need to know whether that moratorium will be extended or if it'll be permanently eliminated in order to price appropriately for 2018 or has that date already passed? And if the health insurer fee is reinstated for 2018, what impact would you expect that to have on growth and Medicare Advantage? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. So we'll parse those questions up. I think Dan will talk about...\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Good morning Dave. Obviously, from our perspective, we have been long supporters of the permanent repeal of the health insurers\u2019 tax. At the end of the day, obviously, it just increases the cost of healthcare, makes it less affordable and compromises people's ability to gain coverage. So we are certainly advocating along those lines. As we think about the tax itself, obviously, we\u2019ve got to deal with it as it sits currently in loss, and so that's what we're doing. We're planning accordingly. We're incorporating it in pricing and also incorporating in our thinking as we plan our benefits in Medicare. In terms of timing, there's different timings based on the businesses. So obviously small business, starts to resolve itself clearly now and into May, for next year large group takes later in the commercial process. And then as you look at the Medicare business that first Monday and in June is when we're doing our filing. So as it sits right now, we will plan accordingly and incorporate it. And as you think about, if it were repealed, obviously, we talked about the benefit of the moratorium in 2017 and size that in the $0.25 EPS range. Obviously, when it went out versus when it would come back in, the size of that, if it were to stay, is about a 30% increase in the tax itself. And then obviously, we've done well to grow market share over that time. So you can expect that, if the tax comes back in, it would come back in at a greater impact than what we talked about for '17. I think that covers it.\nDave Wimbley: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: My question just on a retail presence and I'm just curious. Do you think UnitedHealth Group, overall, would benefit from a larger retail footprint beyond just urgent care centres? And where did that stack up on your list of priorities in terms of capital deployment and what you want to do?\nStephen Hemsley: Interesting question, I think we're actually gaining market presence through OptumCare and through -- and that growing portfolio. And I think you probably not talk much about this. But we've also tried to increase our community presence in our UnitedHealthcare benefits in terms of we do offer some store front, kiosks. So that is a coming trend, but I think we'll take that in a measured way. And I think the other thing Josh to think about is your digital presence, if you think about it, whether retail is or physical presence is as strategic today as digital presence might be. And we've obviously taken some really powerful steps in terms of developing digital capabilities through the rally platform and our other applications. So we kind of are moving out in both those directions and we'll take it in a measured way and make sure that we're staging into the marketplace in that presence thoughtfully. Beyond it, I don't think I can offer too much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Sidell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nScott Sidell: I had a question, just if you can talk about how your caulking out the final MA rates for 2018, and any swing factors that you saw, whether that was pretty straightforward. And then just also, separately just related to MA, maybe just give us an update on how the claims experience seems to be tracking so far in MA book, particularly in terms of the new members that you\u2019ve added so far this year? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure, and I think the benefits obviously will be more measured because that is more strategic, et cetera. But, Brian, you want to respond?\nBrian Thompson: Sure, thank you. Good morning, Scott. With respect to the rates, we do continue to be concerned about the underfunding of the MA program. I think this is now 13% in cuts, since 2010. The final rates, where I believe 45 basis points of improvement year-over-year to the industry still in positive territory, but less than what we did experienced a year ago. I do believe though our starts advance in 2018 will help us relative to the industry, and will help us as we continue to navigate through this funding environment to provide, what is our number one priority is around benefit stability or underlying members. As we think about the growth that we\u2019re experiencing, we\u2019re three months in. And what we\u2019re seeing is aligning to our expectations, both in terms of mix and cost profiles, and we are very pleased with our industry leading growth. As you know about half of that growth is coming from our group business with the balance inside our individual. And I can't emphasize enough the role retention has played. I believe this is the third consecutive year where we\u2019ll be breaking our own performance records on member attention. And that is the biggest driver of our individual growth this year over last. And as Dave mentioned at the outset, the themes are the same as a year ago; stability in our offerings, in our network; the advancements we\u2019ve shown in our quality, as evidenced with our stars; continued improvement in engagement and satisfaction with our house calls. And when you wrap it all up, we\u2019re certainly pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. And I think this growth is a positive validation of the priorities we\u2019ve been focused on.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: I just want to go, I guess to Larry's comments about the momentum, heading into 2018 in Optum. Because I guess, we look at this year Q1 Optum growth for all three businesses was less, and the annual number for 2016, I think, 2016 for all three businesses was less than what we saw in 2015. So when you talk about momentum into next year, obviously, the absolute growth rates are still pretty strong, but it's been decelerating over the last couple of years. When you talk about momentum in 2018, are we talking about consisting growth, reaccelerating growth? How do we think about that context and of those businesses, which business do you feel most confident about, seeing that momentum into 2018?\nStephen Hemsley: I\u2019ll let Larry take that. But I think the growth is actually across optimism has been pretty impressive. And each year, they drive bigger numbers, so they\u2019re growing off a bigger platform. And I think people lose sight of the share size and scale of Optum. But Larry you can handle it yourself.\nLarry Renfro: Sure. So Kevin, I guess, the way that I would -- let me approach it a couple of different ways. We have put together, obviously, our plans in terms of how we attack the market for the first five years and we\u2019re in the process as we talked about early that we are developing a second generation plan that we\u2019re going forward with right now. When we are looking at sales and we\u2019re looking at growth, we look at certain factors as an organization and pretty much everybody in Optum operates off of these factors; number one, would be the backlog that we talked about being about $2.1 billion year-over-year. We talked about, I guess we didn\u2019t get into what we look at in terms of our sales pipeline that finished 2016 at about $30 billion and that was up from 2015 at about $10 billion. And then you look at our overall sales in terms of the TCV and that was probably what I just said, the $10 billion to the $30 billion in sales and the overall pipeline would be about $30 billion. So that\u2019s been tremendous growth in terms of how we look at it. Now, if we look at the first quarter of 2017, I don\u2019t want to go into the numbers. But I would tell you, it\u2019s a record quarter in terms of overall sales. Some of the factors that might enter into this, in terms of overall revenue that might make think something that might be a little bit different is that we, as we -- if you just look at Catamaran or you look at what we\u2019re doing in OptumRx. We are absolutely having scale and efficiency that\u2019s driving a better customer -- totally driving better customer value. And as a result of that, some of those numbers might look a different. And I'm going to ask Tim to talk a little bit about that in a second. But I think that, as we look into 2018, we think that we\u2019re very well positioned. We think that we are on target with all of our expectations. We have the five growth areas that we\u2019re focused on; the government services; what we\u2019re doing in OptumCare; what we\u2019re doing with Pharmacy Care services; technology services, as well as international. So we feel very, very downhill about 2018. So Tim may be comment a little bit on the OptumRx side.\nTim Wicks: Thanks, Larry. Kevin, Tim Wicks, CFO of Optum, just wanted to follow on with what Larry talked about in terms of the integration efforts at OptumRx. I think one of the things that\u2019s really important to understand is that as we continue to drive progress and our integration efforts are deepening, this is really translating into lower drug cost for consumers and customers. And it\u2019s really a key part of the helping us drive earnings growth performance year-over-year. And our expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress around the levers that we\u2019re driving around the integration efforts that Larry referenced.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from A. J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nA. J. Rice: Maybe I'll just ask a broad question around the evolving landscape and wash on your thoughts on that. We\u2019re not really sure where the ACA revealing or replace is at this point. But some of the things have been discussed are such as easing up on the essential benefit package, given more flexibility with respect to the rating span, shifting more discretion overall for healthcare to the states. I wonder do you guys have a strong view on that. And also ask if we do pivot to tax policy, are there any -- obviously a lot of domestic earnings, almost all domestic earnings you have would assume you would be a beneficiary. But is there any nuances around that we should think about? And then finally on the regulatory, the CMS has asked the industry to offer up suggestions on the regulatory front. Is there anything that either you or the industry would highlight on that score?\nStephen Hemsley: Sure, A.J. I would -- it's probably not often that we say this. But if you really actually have been following the media with respect to the activities, with respect to healthcare policy, I would say that the media has been very accurate with respect to the narrative that is going on there, and the elements, many of which you suggest. So I think if you were following the media, generally speaking, you'd be up to speed. And we couldn\u2019t probably offer anymore insights than that. In our prepared remarks, we obviously focused on the health insurance tax. Because that, as Dan said, is going into the marketplace now for 2018. And that has an impact on affordability and the uptake of the participation in those markets. So we are strong advocate of repealing that and to taking that action as quickly as possible. Beyond that, we have engaged. We think pretty constructively around the notion of, and I think you can see this in our published materials on our Web site, that we see actually a marketplace that could be pretty constructive. But based upon more orientation to state based markets, more flexibility in the marketplace, really seeing Medicaid as the programs that have grown in effectiveness and to become broadly recognized as actually very efficient healthcare coverage for the populations to which they apply. And the elements that you mentioned the flexibility with respect to underwriting activities and so forth, we think those all would be covered in what we would see as more flexible state based markets that are actually more under the control of those that are close to the market in the state. I think all those things are really in conversation, but I think it's really around what is politically possible, maybe in contrast to what might be the most effective policies that could be applied. I would say that the tone has been generally more positive and access has been more available. So there is little bit more of a constructive posture. And so we remain hopeful that as this policy evolves that it could be better for coverage for American people, and return to the innovation and flexibility of the marketplace. And we think healthcare will benefit from that. Corporate tax, I think broadly will benefit, broadly across America in terms of economics, in terms of Company's outlooks. And in our sector we'd be similar to that. We have high effective tax rate and we think that tax reform at the corporate level will be good for consumers. It will play back into their benefit. We think it'll be good for employment levels. And we would obviously benefit from that and it will be good in terms of just the overall level of resource that we dedicate to at the corporate tax line. So we would be an advocate of thoughtful tax reform, and I think the majority of American industry would.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSarah James: If I look at the Medicaid RFP platform for the next two or three years, it has a good amount of rebids as opposed to new contracts. And if I think further out, a lot of the new opportunity is in the higher acuity population. So how do you think about the influence of competitive rebids and a shift to higher acuity populations on the long term margin profile of your Medicaid book? And what do you see as the organic growth profile of Medicaid? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: I actually think both will be \u2013 both of positive trends, Austin?\nAustin Pittman: So first and foremost, the RFP pipeline remain strong, you hit it while there is both new populations coming into Medicaid; there're new geographies being expanded within existing states; and there're greenfield states that are looking to continue to move. I think it's just a measure of the continued value year-after-year that Medicaid has provided to consumers and to our state partners. So we don't see a slowdown in that movement. The movement in populations with more complex needs, and I think Dave actually touched on this in his opening comments, really plays to the core capabilities of UnitedHealthcare and Optum both. When you combine the data analytics capability, the clinical insights, the local delivery mechanisms that we've now got in place, combining physical, behavioral and social needs, we really feel like we've established a real foothold in serving populations. We\u2019re very pleased with the response we've gotten from consumers in the D-SNP category that Dave spoke to. We've seen the consumer experience continue to improve. We've got NPS now over 74, so just really outstanding. We're not going to rest on that, we're going to continue to learn to serve these populations better and better. And you're right. We think that'll continue to be an area of significant growth that plays to our strengths. With regards to the earnings profile, like all of our government programs, we expect that to be in the 3% to 5% margin range. And certainly, we\u2019ll be on a higher revenue base. So when you look at the membership growth, you'll have to adjust for the type of members those are because those more complex needs members do drive higher revenue.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJustin Lake: My question is broadly around the UHC business, just given the strength here, curious if you can give us some directional color at least in terms of how the segments within that business were performing in terms of margin and profitability. And then Dan, your comments on the health insurer fee are really helpful, a lot of questions here. So just hoping maybe you could take that one last step further and help us put a range around the EPS headwind it would present in 2018 if it's not repealed versus the $0.25 tailwind that it\u2019s adding this year? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Dan, you want to pick up where you left off.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Good morning, Justin. I appreciate the temp on the health insurers\u2019 fee. I think we'll leave specific sizing to that for our investor conference and also obviously a better understanding of what the actual law will be as we step into 2018. As it relates to your question around the UHC businesses, as Dave mentioned in the prepared remarks we were able to drive 12% revenue growth rate across the platform. And if you adjust for the impacts of health insurers\u2019 fee and the individual ACA, the reduction in our footprint there, we drove closer to about 17% growth rate in our UnitedHealthcare business. And as you underneath that, we had really nice growth in every one of our business platforms. And the driver of that revenue growth that we\u2019re seeing pull through to our earnings base is really the enrollment expansions. And as you look at each of our business platforms it\u2019s happening in the places that frankly we have an opportunity to deliver greater value and greater returns. So as you look at the commercial business, we\u2019re growing nicely inside that group commercial fully insured business in Medicare and in Medicare Advantage. And in Medicaid, orienting towards, as Austin just talked about, more complex and more vulnerable populations, all which have more revenue content and likewise have strong earnings potential for us as a business. So on balance very strong medical cost well controlled and very much in keeping with our expectations. So we\u2019re pleased with the first quarter favorable mix.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nRalph Jacoby: Just want to go back to last question, specifically on the UnitedHealthcare margins, 5.3% this quarter. You ended last year around those levels. I guess what we\u2019re looking for is maybe a sense of where margins currently fit across the mark deal each end market at this point, where you still see room for expansion. Obviously, understanding that population should shifts are going to impact that. But just want to understand where there still is upside for margin expansion in each of the end market? Thanks.\nDan Schumacher: Ralph, this is Dan again. As far as the end markets and the margins, obviously, we\u2019ve guided to and talked about government based margins in the 3% to 5% range and across their Medicare and Medicaid portfolios that we\u2019re operating within those ranges. And we obviously endeavour to perform towards the high end of that range. And on the commercial business, we\u2019re in the mid to upper single digits, and performing well in that business. And as we think about margin expansion or [audio gap], I would say earnings growth more specifically, we\u2019re looking to orient drive our earnings growth more from volume, so continuing to serve more consumers across our broad and diversified platform. And where there is opportunity, we\u2019ll look to expand margins as well, but feeling good about our positioning in each of our businesses. And better and better Medical Care management, no doubt but commercial and Medicare being strongest and probably Medicaid follow that.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nChris Rigg: I wanted to see if you can provide anymore color around the goals and net promoter score. First, can you just give us the basis, I know you said a four point improvement across the three segments, so where you are today? And then more importantly for investors, and we think 70 and seven years, what does that mean for capital deployment priorities? And is it sort of you are looking -- need to look externally to buy capabilities or is it more about just putting money back into what you already have? Thanks.\nLarry Renfro: That\u2019s a great question, and half a day on. But Dave you want to take that this morning?\nDave Wichmann: Thanks Chris, great question, I appreciate it. As Larry stated, we\u2019ve meaningfully advanced our MPS disciplines in the business, I would say, over call it about two years now or so. And as he also indicated, we\u2019ve now fully aligned it to our compensation systems, which should give you some senses as to how we feel about the integrity of the data that we\u2019re receiving and also the ability of our organization to actually influence these results. Both businesses have shown very meaningful progress, and that\u2019s across the consumer client and care provider scores as well. So we do look at this in a multi-dimensional way. We generate a wide range of performance across our business. We, like anything we measure this over a multiple different sales in our business, and our performance does range out quite widely, which is one of the objectives that we have over this time period which is to get to more consistency, which will lead to a greater support of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum and other brands across our business overall. We gave you an expectation of 70 and seven years, and it\u2019s unlike to actually think and report out on a seven year basis. We\u2019re basically telling you the same things that we\u2019ve engaged our employees around, which is to have and seek to meaningfully improve our performance across multiple dimensions in our business. And that\u2019s exactly what they do they do this by analyzing why people promote our products, why there are detractors and our products. That deep analytic and then the action plans are developed around that are what really provide the substance to this program. And the achievement as measured is critical and important. And we just called out the achievements of UnitedHealthcare this morning, we could easily -- we\u2019ve done the same for Optum. But they have improved just so far in this first quarter alone by 4 points, which all the NPS statisticians out there would suggest that is a meaningful and statistical improvement year-over-year. So while this 70 is an aggregated number it does mark a plan of achievement over the course of the seven years towards a greater satisfaction and a greater a reference point of consumers, clients and care providers of our business. And I\u2019d suggest you that\u2019s on a baseline of about 40 or so today, which is a meaningful score, meaningful place. But honestly what we\u2019re trying to do is to reorient what our expectations are around satisfactory service and performance broadly as an organization. In terms of capital deployment, it\u2019s already found its way into the way in which we operate our call centres, how we process claims, how we handle adjustments and call backs from consumers and how we engage with the market base broadly. I wouldn\u2019t see this as something that\u2019s going to be capital intensive. It is something that just shapes the way in which we spend our CapEx annually. And likely will result in additional investment across the business. Again, our goal here is to create a higher NPS, which drives greater trust with the marketplace, trust to get loyalty, loyalty to get drove. And you're starting to see that shape up in the retention across our business. Retention is important, it gets us greater predictability in our business, overall, but it also provides a great launching pad for growth into the future.\nChris Rigg: That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.\nLarry Renfro: I think it comes down to how we spend that capital, and doing it effectively. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a more capital issue it will give us insight to how we spend it more effectively. Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Just wanted to ask a little bit about the TVM growth outlook and in particular for OptumRx, what is the composition of clients looking like, going forward. How much do you think you're going to be able to improve on penetration in your UHC self insurer block there. And what's the outlook for margin profile is that evolves, going forward?\nStephen Hemsley: Maybe Dirk, you want to start that out and then John Prince.\nDirk McMahon: I would say that we talked a little bit about the 2016 momentum that we had sold to some fairly sophisticated buyers throughout 2016. And in the script we also talked about the Healthcare Transformational Alliance. And again, we were chosen as a partner for that group. So from that perspective, I think our value proposition is resonating with the sophisticated buyer population. I would say in answer to your question about how we would further penetrate within UnitedHealthcare, I think it just goes back to our synchronization value story; our ability to take in the medical data, the pharmacy data; take that in with our next best action protocols and have our call service agents, get people disease management and clinical management program. So I think from the value proposition standpoint that will drive with UnitedHealthcare. More broadly about the market, I turn over to John to talk about what we\u2019re seeing in issuer selling season.\nJohn Prince: Thanks Dirk. Good morning, Lance. This is John Price, CEO of OptumRx. In terms of 2018, we\u2019re still in the early in the season. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s chasing up to be a very robust season compared to last year. Our differentiated offering is really resonating in the market in terms of the things starting. Our pipeline is very similar to last year includes large government, labor, payer and employer bids. So it\u2019s a very robust market in terms of the diversity. There is also a lot of large strategic opportunities, which are in line with our expectations. The RFP volume is as well as the mix of clients is as expect in terms of expectations. So I think this is shaping up to be a very solid year. In terms of pricing competition, pricing remains robust in the market but disciplined. So we're also excited about that. And also very excited about how the market is responding to our solution similar to last year, our differentiated offerings in terms of things, focusing on managing drug cost as well as the total cost of healthcare is really resonating in the market. In terms of Lance your last session with the margin, our margin expectations haven't changed. We're still expecting 3% to 5% long term outlook for the market.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nMichael Baker: My question's for Dirk. Given the fact that you're headed back to Optum in a more elevated role. Could you give us a sense of your top three priorities?\nDirk McMahon: Well, I think to start off with my first one is to make UnitedHealthcare and Optum work better together, that will be number one. I think I have a good perspective of what works from a value creation standpoint and works from a customer standpoint across both business platforms. And I would start with that. I would add on to, from an NPS perspective, Dave mentioned that. NPS is very important. Pharmacy care services is a huge -- is the most heavily used benefit within the healthcare space. I think making sure that that operates well is important, we really gotten off to a good start there. And I would also say making sure that with respect to some of the integration that we have and it\u2019s still continuing, I would say that that's another area where it would be a high priority for me. And last thing I would say is from a technology standpoint, Optum technology making sure that we deliver on the technology is needed across the enterprise on behalf of our customers. One of the big things is simplification from a technology standpoint, from an NPS standpoint. And what I would say is that's a good place to focus as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Cheryl Connick with Mizuho. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nCheryl Connick: I had been wondering when the management shift or rotation would occur, it seems like it was a long time. So nice to see the Company is strong enough to be able to do that at this time, and do it so easily with some of the folks. The question that I have though is if we could, and I almost take assets Managed Care question, but I will. If we could dig down into the cost trend a little bit, you usually give us a breakdown in how much you see in utilization of in-patient versus out-patient, perhaps pharmacy trend. But if we can think about this from a value based perspective, what if anything, are you seeing in any differences over time in the composition of your cost trend. And if you can step back and analyze that a little bit. Now that you're in the care provider business, pretty strongly with OptumCare on the one side, and certainly your network construction on the other. What should we be thinking about those shifts? And how we might see the composition of the cost trend changing over time even if the level stays relatively constant?\nStephen Hemsley: I'll start out with a few themes and then ask my colleagues on the UnitedHealthcare side to pick it up. But I guess Cheryl a good question and a thoughtful one. We have been seeing a pretty steady movement of services into, and I'll say, the out-patient setting, are out to the community. And we have been following them with the OptumCare platform and encouraging that. And thinking that that is a more ideal setting in which to engage and do those services. And we actually think the care technology is facilitating that. It is the procedures are getting simpler and more advanced, the rehabilitation processes, the care processes and so forth, all play to that. Also I think we've been pretty consistent about suggesting that we've seen more in terms of specialty pharma application, diagnostic testing; and those have been more of the trends in the acute care setting has been. And I would say that we're pretty hopeful and optimistic that better, let's say, a better formulation or application of resources in the community setting holds a lot of benefit, particularly whereas consumers are becoming more knowledgeable, more information is available to them and they're being more engaged in picking the right settings for the services they need. Dan, you want to pick up on that.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thanks, Steve. In addition to, I think what you did well to describe is some of that shift from the acute care setting to ambulatory settings, and that shift that comes from in-patient to out-patient. I think the other place Cheryl that I would point to is a greater investment around physician; so really them at the centre of the care continuum and making investments, and really connecting care in a whole-person way and investing in primary care, in particular. So as we think about the composition of where our spend is going, we do see shifts from in-patient to out-patient, a greater investment towards physician and then obviously some of the comments that Steve made with regard to pharmacy inside it.\nStephen Hemsley: And maybe Andrew, you have some perspectives, new voice and fresh perspective on that?\nAndrew Hayek: I would echo what's been said. We do see across OptumCare, which of course include SCA and also our neighbourhood care centres. And medical groups, the Option D for more care to occur in the out-patient setting, improving the experience, quality and cost to healthcare, and improving the provider experience. So we're excited about what we see in the opportunity ahead.\nStephen Hemsley: And we\u2019re seeing the consumer more comfortable coming into these venues, and that\u2019s also really encouraging thing, so great question and we\u2019ll continue to focus on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAna Gupte: I wanted to get some more color more broadly on your Optum margin outlook, and your targets and appointment time. You\u2019ve seen some margin expansion this quarter and Insight and in Rx, not in Health. Do you still have, as a priority, a stretch goal with margin expansion you used to have one before Catamaran? And where is the most leverage in the model, by segment, is it in OptumCare and OptumHealth, or Insight or elsewhere?\nLarry Renfro: We do, and I think Larry alluded to that in terms of revisiting one Optum. And I am going to ask Tim to comment on this. But going back to I think what you were talking about the model we had what something called one point time it was 15 by 15 and it was 8 by 16. And what's Steve\u2019s alluding to we\u2019ve played that those two through. And now we\u2019re in the process of putting together a new five year business plan that we\u2019re calling the second generation. And so there will be an emphasis on a lot of different things. But margin will be part of that. So I'll ask Tim to comment on that.\nTim Wicks: A couple of things to consider, as Larry mentioned about the energy that we\u2019re putting around second generation of one Optum; there is a significant amount work around and ensuring that we\u2019re investing in the areas where we see growth opportunities to be able to drive sustainable growth in the future. And I think it's important to consider that we make investments in our businesses, really focused around our ability to grow and that confidence in the growth in those areas. I\u2019d say a great example of that is revenue at OptumHealth in the first quarter grew 18% year-over-year. And OptumHealth earnings grew 11%, while we made strategic investments across the platform, including Medicare deliveries significant growth in house call care capacity and implementing new behavioural clients. And as Larry alluded to as we think about the diverse portfolio across Optum, including margin expansion in Insight and Rx, we expanded overall Optum margin by 40 basis points while making the investments that I just described in OptumHealth; so that we think about it as a pretty seamless approach to driving investments in the businesses where we see growth and being able to drive overall earnings growth as well broadly across Optum. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMike Newshel: Can you give us an update on M&A and new contracts internationally, looks like you just got regulatory approval for another small provider acquisition in Brazil and there are potentially some more assets there for sale. Are you looking to do more deals, and what's your focus in terms of provider versus insurance assets? And second is there any update on international opportunities on the Optum side as well, and UK in particular? Thanks.\nStephen Hemsley: Sure. We\u2019ll start with Dave.\nDave Wichmann: Sure. Thank you, Mike, it\u2019s a good question. As you have noted, we have been somewhat active in Brazil and we have been over the five year duration that we\u2019ve owned Amil, which we now refer to as UnitedHealth Group Brazil; constituting Amil the benefits business, Americas Servicos Medicos which is our healthcare delivery business and then Optum as an emerging services business there as well. We of course have and we\u2019re very curious about M&A broadly across our business. As you know, we don\u2019t comment specifically on individual targets, but we do see broadly across our business M&A as a way to continue to invest the very strong cash flows of this enterprise. And I would suggest you that our interest are primarily in the Optum services markets, as you see us, particularly investing in OptumCare. And then we do have interest in select very thoughtful capital deployment and international markets, as well as some plug-in work that we'll continue to do at UnitedHealthcare overall. So, that\u2019s what I would suggest you our priorities.\nMike Newshel: Okay, thank you.\nLarry Renfro: This is Larry. I'll comment on Optum, and what we\u2019re doing in the UK. So it's something that would just relate to in the United States we always talked about 75 market strategy. If you are in the UK, we would talk about a 44 market strategy. And they have developed a mechanism that they call strategic transformation plan. And they have linked together their trust and their trust would equal their hospitals. And so they have multiple hospitals that are in these SPPs as they call them. So in February, early February, we won our first business first step of a process with one of those SPPs. And that\u2019s where you're going to manage with an ACO process, and we do have physician groups. And so we\u2019re tying in everything we do in the states into that win that we just received. Now, it\u2019s a first phase of it, we have about two more that are very, very close to have an a decision on. And doing that, we strengthen the leadership then we\u2019ve moved to a couple of people over so on and in order to manage this the way that we\u2019ll need to manage this, going forward. I would say that we\u2019re still in a situation, nationally. I look at the -- those 44 SPP is more local markets. But nationally, there are various things going on with data and information and digital that we are actually working with them very, very closely right now as well. I know in the May timeframe we\u2019ll have a showcase where we\u2019ll showcase all of our technologies, as well as we\u2019ll have the Secretary of Health visiting us here in the States as well as a subset of the NHS board visiting us here in the states in the May timeframe. So things seem to be breaking a lose right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nChristine Arnold: Let's ask about OptumCare and SCA. How much overlap was there between the locations where you've got primary care and your urgent care with SCA? And where are we in terms of innings in terms of building out OptumCare, do we feel that we need more specialists? How do we think about the progression of that business and how do we measure it overtime?\nAndrew Hayek: This is Andrew. Appreciate the question. So in terms of overlap with the SCA and OptumCare markets, about 17 of the current OptumCare, primary care markets overlap with where SCA is. And SCA adds another about 17 markets that OptumCare positions are not in that are material MSAs. In terms of the mix of primary and specialist, we do see opportunities to leverage the presence we have with primary care. It\u2019s the relationships and brings more of the SCA model in to the benefit experience cost and the quality of care, which obviously helps the primary care groups and also helps our health payers and health system partners. So we do see opportunity to expand the model and be inclusive of more specialists, which we think inners to the benefit of the patients and the healthcare system.\nChristine Arnold: And when will it take to build this out?\nAndrew Hayek: Well, I\u2019d say that\u2019s multiyear. Christine, you remember we\u2019ve talked about this in let\u2019s say 75 markets is a first priority. And while we have a presence in many of those markets that presents isn\u2019t complete where we really have the the entire model represented in that marketplace where that model has been fully integrated. So I would say we continue to be in the very early stages of what our ambitions might be around OptumCare.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Gary Taylor with J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Just had one, fairly precise question. I was wondering when we look at OptumInsight. What percentage of the total revenues or Medicare Advantage risk coding services, what percentage of its net external sales would be in a risk coding services? And has there been any impact on the trajectory of sales given some of the recent legal scrutiny?\nStephen Hemsley: I'm not aware of any change in that, and it's not really that significant. Do we have an answer to that?\nEric Murphy: This is Eric Murphy, CEO of OptumIsight. We haven't seen any impact in terms of changes to both our existing business, as well as the strength of our pipeline. And I think we're in a very-very favourable position in that side of the market, just given the comprehensive nature of the capabilities that we bring to the marketplace with the integration of both risk and quality.\nStephen Hemsley: And it's not that big a line up of offering relative to the total of Optum. I don\u2019t know if we can size that, but it's just not that large, the product line. So, thank you. Thanks for your questions this morning. And we hope the discussion has given you a sense of the optimism we have for 2017-2018, and beyond. As I think you can see our businesses are growing and we're providing increasingly differentiated value to a more diverse set of markets than others, and we're building deeper relationships with customers, consumers. And I think most importantly improving the healthcare experience essentially for all stakeholders, and I think that's how we'll continue to grow over the next decade, So thank you and we'll see you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a great day."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-15 17:37:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical difference or present expectations. A description of some of the risk and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports & SEC Filings section of the company\u2019s Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 15, 2019, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company\u2019s Web site. I would now turn the conference over to Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. At our Investor Conference just a few weeks ago, we provided an extensive and positive review of our business and expectations for 2019 and beyond.  Our outlook today remains consistent with that view. We are strongly confident in the fundamentals of our business as we enter 2019, in our ability to invest, innovate and grow and in the breadth of opportunities across healthcare available to a company with the unique capabilities we have built over time to deliver ever more value to society and consistent results for our shareholders.  The results we reported this morning bear that out. Full year revenues exceeded $226 billion growing 12% or $25 billion over 2017. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share were stronger than our Investor Conference outlook, with full year adjusted earnings per share growing 28% to $12.88 per share. Revenues, operating earnings, and cash flows were in line with or ahead of the expectations for 2018 we discussed with you at that time.  Optum\u2019s earnings were ahead and UnitedHealthcare\u2019s earnings were in line, and virtually all businesses closed out the year with strong momentum. Overall medical costs remain well controlled and our positive forecast for 2019 remains consistent across all lines of business.  We continued to address performance pressures in a handful of Medicaid markets in the fourth quarter as we executed actions on both structural costs and rate recovery to ensure 2019 will see a return to stronger margin levels for this business.  Our nation is early in an exciting healthcare innovation wave, one we expect to help lead, which will drive growth at UnitedHealth Group for years to come. Our approach to this wave has several characteristics. Flowing critical health information to all healthcare participants by linking physical interactions to digital channels supported by embedded proprietary clinical ontology and sophisticated data analytics designed to align and optimize performance; engaging people in their healthcare both individually and at scale, a difficult but essential step in improving people\u2019s health and finances, a step supported by our consumer digital platform, Rally, now with 22 million registered users on a multi payor platform and offering an expanded suite of services for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicaid members as of January 1; applying high-touch human interactions again singly at high volumes to improve the consumer experience and drive better medical care outcomes.  This is supported by our rapidly growing team of clinicians like the physicians of Polyclinic in Seattle who joined us at the end of 2018; evolving pharmacy care services by advancing market-leading transparency; improved adherence in clinical effectiveness combined with distinguished consumer value ranging from point-of-care discounts that offer more affordable prescriptions and whole person medical pharmacy management to a simpler transaction experience through market-leading digital support tools and services; and introducing innovative, lower cost consumer-centric health benefit designs and services such as Bind, Colorado Doctor\u2019s Plan, Motion, and NexusACO. This healthcare system will increasingly operate in a multi-payer and value-based context with aligned incentives for care providers and consumers to make better healthcare decisions leveraging deeply personalized information and clinical science. This modern approach produces measurable value and looks and feels refreshingly different than traditional healthcare today. So, I hope you can see why we are energized by the opportunities ahead of us.  With that, let me turn it to Optum\u2019s CEO, Andrew Witty to discuss Optum\u2019s results and its unique market position and momentum heading into 2019. Andrew? \nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Dave. Our focus is to accelerate the access to and integration of the individual strengths of Optum to deliver better healthcare and more affordability across the whole of the health system. In leveraging our data analytics capability to improve care pathways with local care delivery and pharmacy care services, we have unique potential to improve patient well-being and health while bringing healthcare costs under better control.  Our ability to use data to better understand the next best action or better option for treatments allows us to significantly affect both the outcome as well as the cost per member for our clients and patients. Within OptumRx, the increasing impact of PreCheck MyScript and the growth of our infusion services illustrate how our expanding breadth of services are gaining significant market acceptance, growing share and diversifying our earnings stream.  Our momentum in pharmacy care services was excellent in 2018 with retained business rate in excess of 98% and several major new business awards from health plans and employer plan sponsors. We expect this to continue given the early positive signs in this year\u2019s selling season for 2020 business.  In care delivery, our clinical leaders are applying clinical decision support based on evidence-based guidelines that promote better health and ensure the right care at the right time in the right method. Today, 99% of OptumCare patients in our advanced form of Medicare value arrangements are in four star plans or better, and OptumCare\u2019s average net promoter score is nearly 80, evidence of outstanding clinical outcomes and patient experiences.  We achieved significantly lower total medical cost by keeping people healthier and avoiding unnecessary hospital use, which translates to up to 30% lower cost for our Medicare Advantage patients relative to original Medicare. Our increased number of our groups are being recognized for achieving lower cost for commercial customers as well.  For example, our Reliant Medical Group was recognized having the lowest total cost of care by the State of Massachusetts. We complement our medical groups with high value ambulatory care services like our SCA Surgery Centers, MedExpress Neighborhood Care Clinics, Briova Infusion Capability, and Optum HouseCalls, all of which support improving the quality, cost, and experience of healthcare.  As we move forward, we will continue to build out our comprehensive portfolio of care delivery services in key markets, including through our pending combination with the Davita Medical Group. By 2030, there will be over 80 million people in the U.S. with three or more chronic conditions, up from 30 million in 2015.  More fully leveraging data analytics across all of Optum through digital and physical engagement with patients and physicians will be key to reducing costs and improving the value and experience for people in this increasingly resource-intensive market segment. We are building platforms that are convenient for the provider, ensuring the very best and most contemporary information is available to support each patient management decision. Initiatives including the rollout of the individual health record, adoption of emerging genomic knowledge, and full understanding of the implications of the data Optum manages will be key to build \u2013 key building blocks over the next year or two. Turning to Optum\u2019s financial results. Full year 2018 revenues surpassed $100 billion for the first time. Revenue growth of over $10 billion for the year accelerated to 11% from 9% in 2017, and likewise our operating margins once again strengthened across the Optum portfolio with our overall operating earnings growing more than $1.5 billion or 23% to $8.2 billion reflecting the leverage of Optum\u2019s scale businesses and putting us in a strong baseline earnings position entering 2019.  Looking ahead, the 150,000 people at Optum are incredibly enthusiastic about 2019 and our opportunity to a longer term growth and performance. We will continuously modernize our ways of working, seek solutions to improve value delivery to our clients and the patients we serve and explore ways of aligning with others who strive in an accountable way to deliver quality care at lower costs.  We are seeing the fruits of two decades worth of strategic investments with strong business wins and pipelines and the many platform expansion opportunities we have in the United States alone not to mention the global potential.  As we continue to grow, invest and diversify, we are just beginning to realize the potential that exists when we deploy Optum\u2019s cross-platform capabilities more fully on behalf of our customers, and all of those we serve.  Now, I will turn the call over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO. \nSteve Nelson: Thank you, Andrew. UnitedHealthcare is growing through the relentless pursuit of better health outcomes, lower total cost of care and a better consumer experience for clients and consumers as measured through NPS. We achieved this triple aim through the breadth and the innovative nature of our capabilities as Dave described at the outset and by translating those capabilities into innovative products, services and enabling technologies which expands our mission as an enterprise.  In 2018, together with our care provider partners and through digital and physical interactions with consumers, we helped close over 70 million gaps in care, and that was 75% more than the 40 million gaps we closed in 2017. Contracts with value-based care features reached $74 billion in runrate spending with about one quarter of that in risk arrangements.  Consumers who took healthy actions earned a remarkable $1.5 billion in incentives through their benefit plans. We provided 1.5 million in-home health assessments through the Optum Care \u2013 the Optum Health Calls program and our community health workers referred people to social services nearly 600,000 times linking them to needed services with a total value of one quarter of a billion dollars.  Collectively, the value of these and other distinctive services helps us to grow. In 2018, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 2.4 million more people with revenues advancing by more than $20 billion to $183.5 billion. UnitedHealthcare earnings from operations were $9.1 billion consistent with the outlook we provided in November.  Overall, medical cost trends remain well managed, predictable and consistent with expectations. We continue to manage operating cost diligently through a combination of business simplification, automation and operating efficiency.  As we noted at our Investor Conference, the performance of our Community & State business in 2018 was mixed. We saw strength in serving individuals with the highest health needs such a duly eligible while performance in the traditional TANF Medicaid business was pressured particularly in a handful of states.  Our performance improved in the back half of 2018 with more work to be done continued advocacy for sound rates, while reducing core medical and operating costs. The Community & State team is fully focused and will deliver improved performance in 2019.  We completed a strong Medicare advantage enrollment season last month and are on track to achieve 2019 growth with the 400,000 to 450,000 range of expectations. We are thoughtfully advancing in areas like digital therapeutics, real-time health information, and artificial intelligence driving even more distinctive consumer experience, all at lower cost.  We are early in a wave of fresh product innovation for the commercial market with new on-demand health benefits for large employers and new patient-centric care resources organized around high-quality local health systems such as the program we launched on the Front Range at Colorado. We expect strength in the association health plan market and have an unprecedented focus on developing and cross-selling specialty benefits. To summarize, our expectations for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s performance in 2019 are unchanged with what we outlined for you at the end of November. As we look at 2019, 2020 and beyond, we are strengthening our capabilities for customers across UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group. We have a multi-billion dollar, multi-year effort, well underway to address medical and operating cost on a structural basis and improved value for customers.  We are deploying new technologies to provide information to doctors at the point-of-care and are leaning into consumer-centric services like the individual health record and rally and the innovative benefit designs and value-based incentives they can power. And we believe the UnitedHealthcare supported by Optum is uniquely positioned to serve high growth, higher acuity markets like Medicare, duals and patients with complex and chronic conditions.  Now I will turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. \nJohn Rex: Thank you, Steve. This morning we reported full year revenues of $226.2 billion with double-digit percentage growth in the fourth quarter revenues for all reporting business segments. For full year 2018, Optum revenues from customer and affiliated with the United Health grew nearly 13%, a faster pace than affiliated revenues.  This reflects the market\u2019s response as we position Optum and UnitedHealth Group to serve more people independent of payer affiliation even as we offer greater customer and consumer value through United Healthcare.  Balance in diversification can also be seen in our operating earnings performance where Optum contributed 47% of full year 2018 earnings from operations of $17.3 billion including 60% of their earnings in the fourth quarter. To put that mix in perspective, only five years ago, Optum contributed about a quarter of full year consolidated operating earnings.  Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings per share of $3.28 brought full year earnings to $12.88 per share, 28% growth over 2017. Full year cash flows were $15.7 billion or 1.3 times net income growing 16% over 2017. Fourth quarter and full year cash flows reflect the $2.6 billion payment to the U.S. Treasury on October 1 for our customers\u2019 portion of the Federal Health Insurance cap.  Our full year medical care ratio of 81.6% is consistent with the outlook we provided last January of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points and reflects well managed cost strength, despite the margin pressures in parts of our Medicaid business as Steve just discussed. Medical reserves developed favorably in the quarter by $280 million.  We continue to expect a 2019 medical care ratio of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points, which reflects the impact of the health insurance tax deferral this year. The 2018 operating cost ratio of 15.1% was driven by effective cost management and strong growth and lower operating cost businesses, partially offset by ongoing investments to develop and deploy modern technologies and capabilities that advance the value we deliver to people.  Turning to our balance sheet, our full year return on equity was strong at 24.4% and our debt-to-total capital ratio was 40% at year end after placing $3 billion of debt in December. We repurchased $4.5 billion of stock last year and we raised our dividend by 20% back in June to an annual rate of $3.60 per share.  Looking forward, we entered this year with strength, flexibility and momentum and we continue to expect strong growth in adjusted net earnings to a range of $14.40 to $14.70 per share. One last observation on the quarterly earnings progression for 2019. The current first half, second half Street consensus view appears to reflect our seasonal earnings pattern which over time we have described as roughly 48% weighted to the first half.  In spite of that, our sense is that we expect to perform modestly stronger than the current first quarter consensus estimates would suggest. Dave?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. 2018 was a strong year with advances in our businesses, improvements in service and net promoter scores and compelling financial performance, but there is much yet to be done to fully realize our potential to re-imagine healthcare for the benefit of society in the U.S. and globally.  Inside this morning\u2019s business review, we touched on a number of initiatives, all forward leaning, all indicative of a restless ambitious character of this team and our efforts to advance performance in healthcare for those we serve.  With plans firmly in place we are looking to perform strongly in 2019 and lay the foundation for continued growth in 2020 and the decade ahead. We have significant opportunities to diversify and strengthen the offerings we bring to people, and to drive engagement, trust and loyalty across our broad customer base and we will continue to advance personalized interactions with the people we serve and lean into clinical quality in healthcare delivery and our leadership in digital technology.  Let me close now and open up the call to your questions. One question per person please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the color on the medical cost side. I wanted to go back to the Investor Day and ask you about the HIF. It was the first time in probably five years that you didn\u2019t spike out the HIF at all as a moving part either positive or negative.  I wanted to ask you whether this is indicative of just the size, scale, diversification of the company kind of now being able to hit its 13% to 16% long-term trend without worrying about whether the HIF is coming or going or flat year-over-year as we look out to 2020 and beyond. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Justin. As you know, the 13% to 16% growth rate is an average long-term growth rate, and we are in fact committed to it, and I do think there is merit of the scale and size of the company caused us maybe to spend a little bit less time on those reconciliations that maybe what you would have seen in the past. John Rex, would you like to comment? \nJohn Rex: Yes, thanks, Justin. It\u2019s John. Yes, I have to start by saying I\u2019d be remiss to diminish $2.6 billion of our customers\u2019 funds just having been paid for the health insurance tax. That\u2019s still a very significant number for any company, I would say, and a burden for our customers.  So \u2013 but, you are correct in thinking that the non-insurance components of our enterprise continues to grow at a reasonable pace, and as that pacing increases and the mix continues to shift, as a percentage of our earnings mix in terms of the volatility that the HIF coming in and out in any particular starts to diminish as a percentage of the earnings mix. But again, remiss to say that it\u2019s still a very significant burden for Americans. \nDavid Wichmann: And on that score, the health insurance tax is expected to come back in 2020 and I think I\u2019ll recognize this, but it will increase the cost of healthcare by $20 billion for 142 million Americans. That causes the average senior couple to see their premiums raised by $500 per year and for families with small business coverage by about the same amount, around $480 or so per year.  So, our view is that outcome is unacceptable and - because healthcare already cost too much, so we are going to continue to advocate for our appeal, our deferral of this unnecessary tax. We can\u2019t comment or speculate on the outcome, but we would take this opportunity to also applaud the bipartisan actions that have occurred across Congress both the Senate and the House in this past year or so, and hopefully we will get this taken off the backs of consumers there pretty soon. Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Borsch : Yes, I was hoping that you could talk about the factors that drove the medical care ratio to be a little bit higher than what we and I think The Street analysts had modeled. I mean is that purely the result of Medicaid, and I noticed in the press release that you had talked about that trend moderating, but in terms of impact on MCR, it seemed particularly notable this quarter?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, well, thank you, Matthew. The MCR impact in the quarter is almost exclusively due to Medicaid performance. We touched on this at the Investor Conference. I recognize it was in response to a question, but throughout the balance \u2013 throughout 2018, we have seen a pullback in our performance in our Medicaid business, in particular, the TANF portion of it and in particular in a handful of states.  Those issues were as we described in the script, that\u2019s really around both the funding in a handful of states \u2013 some of which you probably recognize were corrected throughout the year, and then also with respect to some of the costs, both medical as well as operating costs in those handful of states.  The rest of our Medicaid business, both duly eligible and the LTSS populations are performing quite nicely. And of course, as you could tell, our Optum businesses are performing well as well as the remainder part of our United Healthcare businesses, both the employer and the Medicare markets. We did make considerable progress through 2018.  I\u2019ll tell you the last half of our Medicaid performance is substantially better than the first half, but it just isn\u2019t quite up to par yet as we look into Q4. We have seen, again nice progress throughout the balance of the year, and we expect 2019 to show considerable additional improvement as we move that business back to its target margin range of 3% to 5%. \nMatthew Borsch : Thank you. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee : Yes. I don\u2019t recall that you guys discussed it earlier, but if I \u2013 I think you referred to earlier that you guys had won a large VA contract, and maybe if you can kind of give us some details around that, I mean, the headline numbers look very big, but I can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019d be necessarily booking all that.  Can you give us maybe some color around how we should be thinking about that, I believe it\u2019s in the Optum Health \u2013 would be in Optum Health, may be you could just give us some sense on how to think about that and would that would ramp up, and any color on that would be helpful. Thank you. \nDavid Wichmann: What you are referring to is the VA Community Care Network contract which was awarded at the end of last year. Andrew Hayek?.\nAndrew Hayek: Thanks, Charles and Dave. So, yes, we were pleased with the award of the VA Community Care Network program to OptumServe in the regions in which we did which were three regions. It\u2019s an honor to serve our veterans, and I would really go out my way to recognize the dedicated and talented OptumServe team that is ready to deliver on this contract.  With the award, Optum can now serve the VA\u2019s capability to provide timely and quality healthcare to more than six million veterans in 36 states to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia and these contracts administer regional networks of high performing licensed healthcare providers who will work together with the VA to provide medical, dental and pharmacy services to veterans who are unable to receive care at their local VA medical center.  So, we look forward to completing the government review process which of course is underway than normal process and ultimately getting to work serving our military veterans and this is a really important step as you have indicated as an important step forward for OptumServe, which really has the potential to bring the full depth and breadth of Optum capabilities to both current and former members or the armed services in the government.  Think it\u2019s also another that be remised to not underscored effect that it\u2019s just another example of when there is tension in healthcare, particularly with government that they seek a public private partnership, so in this case, the VA sought a partnership with the private sector so that they could provide better care to the veterans and we are honored and pleased to be able to win these awards and to serve them. \nDavid Wichmann: Next question. \nCharles Rhyee : Is that included in the guidance?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, it is. The contract begins its implementation in 2019, so it actually is a bit of a drag to earnings and it is a seven year contract. So it will provide its returns on that investments through that seven year timeframe. \nCharles Rhyee : Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. \nSarah James : Thank you. At the Investor Day, one of the things that you talked about was the potential to double commercial specialty revenue. Can you give us an update on how that\u2019s tracking so far in 2019 and provide some more details on the drivers?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. Dan Schumacher, please. \nDan Schumacher: Thanks. Good morning, Sarah. Appreciate the question. Yes, we do and are very focused on deepening our penetration of our specialty blocks within our broader medical, because we think when we bring together, vision, dental, hearing and other assets, you take more of a holistic approach to the person and drive better overall health outcomes.  We made some nice progress in the 1/1 selling cycle to drive deeper penetration. But I would tell you that we are in the early innings in the context of doubling it, dental and vision in particular are going to be the foundational parts of that, but we expect nicer contributions from hearing as we move forward as well. \nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nZach Sopcak : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I appreciate the early selling season comments for the PBM for 2020. Just wanted to get a little more color if there are particular pockets of strength that you are seeing in the 2020 selling season, especially as I think you had mentioned last year you won about three health plan clients on your 2Q call? Thank you. \nDavid Wichmann: Yes, I think noted softer more excess considerable momentum on the top-line and it\u2019s getting really strong market response, John?\nJohn Rex: Thanks, Zach, this is John. Plenty of more excess overall, our differentiated value story is really about today in the market. We have had good uptake in this past selling season. We are very successful in selling over a dozen new large relationships that had a mixture of both states, health plans, unions and a couple large employers.  We have also had good retention. Again we\u2019ve had retention of 98% for the third year in a row which we are very pleased about. I think that links back to our strong scores around net promoter score for our clients as well as our consumers. In terms of 2020, we\u2019ve already sold a couple large deals and added some couple large relationships for 1/1/2020, we have a very healthy pipeline as we go into the new selling season.  As you know, for the 2020 selling season, this time of the year is focused more on the health plans and so we are focused on that and then the large employers as well as the state bids for 2020 are just in the middle of their process. So we are optimistic and also we are very pleased that \u2013 that our story of value and stability is really about the end-markets.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. \nDavid Wichmann: Kevin, you may be on mute.\nKevin Fischbeck : Sorry, can you hear me now?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, we can.\nKevin Fischbeck : Great. So, I just want to go back the MLR question, I guess, specifically on the Medicaid side, wanted to understand two things, one is, is your commentary about the MLR and Medicaid today, the two this is the same as it was back in November or you are highlighting the things that gotten incrementally better or worse from there?  And then two, just mathematically, Medicaid there is still strength that the activity being talked at variance as to MLR in the quarter just given its relative size, so I don\u2019t know if there is anything else that you would highlight on medical costs?\nDavid Wichmann: And you are talking about variance to Street expectations or?\nKevin Fischbeck : Yes, exactly.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay. Well, may what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll comment on Medicaid and then maybe just add John Rex to comment on the MLR in case to make sure that we are fulsome in our response to you on that. We are in exactly the same position or pretty close to the same position we were with Medicaid when we discussed this with you in November, in fact what compelled me to bring it out was the commentary, or I believe the question that was asked \u2013 I believe you asked it actually was\u2026\nKevin Fischbeck : Yes.\nDavid Wichmann: Really around where we may not be performing to our fullest potential and I gave you a few examples this one being on how our business is performing and it is isolated to TANF, it is pretty much isolated to five markets.  There is pretty compelling what these five markets were as it relates to 2018. The only thing I would suggest is that over the last 45 days to 60 days our teams have continued to make very nice progress and in remediating these issues on plan as we look to 2019 for improved results and we do in fact see nice progress with respect to those. And it is a leading contributor to the MLR view, but, John, do you have anything further to add?\nJohn Rex: Sure, Kevin, this is John. Good morning. So, maybe just to start with the, as you kind of teed up the question that - the fully response here. So, I\u2019d characterize the results, highly consistent with what we laid out at the end of November. So UnitedHealthcare\u2019s full year operating earnings is up $9.1 billion. We are just slightly ahead of the point estimate that we provided at that time and I\u2019d put the kind of 81.6% full year consistent with the approximate 81.5% that we cited at the time also.  So I would say it as consistent with the outlook that we had as we got to visit with you at the end of November. So in that line. So beyond CNS as we discuss the benefits, the businesses are performing well at least in line with their expectations, medical costs well contained overall and I would suggest that $280 million in favorable developments in the 4Q also as a reasonable indicator of that. \nKevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thanks, Kevin. Next question please. \nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal : Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate all the color or the answer. Sorry to beat this one. But maybe if I could squeeze my question a follow-up here and maybe could you comment specifically as far as the puts and takes on the commercial side.  And then Medicare or sort of really on the trend and specifically maybe I would love to know the commercial medical cost trends are to track those into 2018 full year guidance range in the fourth quarter and then if Medicare MCR is sort of right in line with your expectations as we well if anything \u2013 there is anything worth calling out there, could be great.\nDavid Wichmann: Dan Schumacher? If you are in commercial.\nDan Schumacher: Yes, good morning, Steve. With regard to the commercial cost trends, a year ago we have guided to a range which we narrowed at the investor conference in November to 5.5% to 6% and I would tell you that on the year we landed squarely within that. So, very pleased with where our cost came in. From our commercial perspective, as well as then how that translated through to in line with our earnings expectations.  And I would just point out that, within our commercial block, we obviously have a seasonal bias towards the fourth quarter and that\u2019s the shift that\u2019s really driven by the type of products that the market is buying as well as another pace at which deductibles are increasing year in and year out. And so, that also contributes to how you look at the performance and its progression over the course of the year. \nDavid Wichmann: And that\u2019s something new. And Medicare had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter and it came in line with expectations, it\u2019s not a little bit ahead.\nSteve Tanal : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nAna Gupte : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, my question was about the vertical consolidation with the deals closing, Cigna is moving their book to Express\u2019. You are looking forward into the new competitive landscape and talk to \u2013 about OptumRx with the $250 to $300 in savings OptumCare on days per thousand. How are you preparing for care gains while maintaining loss ratios and margins going forward in a possibly bundled commercial and PBM environment?\nDavid Wichmann: We are just running our business Ana and running it very well as John pointed out you are seeing strong performance and growth and I think if you track back the last two years and then leaning into 2019 and now leaning into 2020, we continue to see nice response to OptumRx offerings in part because, it goes well beyond the traditional PBM and operates as a pharmacy care services business.  The collaboration between it and United Healthcare is long and well established. So it\u2019s not new meaning that the two of them work very collaboratively together on a wide range of opportunities. Of course, that the pharmacy care services business is available on a multi-pair basis as well. But we have a strong competitive offering.  We work with and deeply respect the new and emerging competition and we are not going to underestimate it but we also remain highly confident in our own capacities to compete and continue to grow and manage our business. \nAna Gupte : Thank you. \nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. \nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Just as you said as the market continues to debate the overall trajectory of the economy exiting 2018 and its 2019. Do you have got a lot of sort of \u2013 few points on that in terms of how the overall economy is progressing in both the UnitedHealthcare and in the Optum businesses. So just interested maybe in some of the more economically sensitive areas what you are seeing in terms of trends in the fourth quarter, particularly related in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter?\nDavid Wichmann: Good questions, Scott. And I have to think in a little bit about this both on the \u2013 we are seeing a lot of economic sentiment if you will, but also political sentiment in healthcare. And I was evaluating that over the course of the last, at least my timeframe here which has been nearing about 21 years or so, just by way of background we have grown our revenue base in this business from $12 billion at that time to $226 billion which we just reported today.  What I find is, particularly in healthcare, as well economic cycles is that, that sentiment tends to drive our private sector expansion and we\u2019ve seen that through Medicare advantage. We see that with the introduction of Part D, managed Medicaid, Duals, Medicaid expansion changes the ACA broadly and then also what we discussed this morning with respect to the VA and how they have sought public private partnership to respond the needs of veterans.  One thing that\u2019s true through these political shifts and economic shifts is that healthcare products are always in demand. So whether it\u2019s an economic expansion or a recession or whether there is a liberal or conservative administration, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s positioning tends to be unique and very well regarded.  We manage a portfolio of diverse healthcare businesses and they serve large and diverse end-markets and we tend to grow regardless of economic cycle or administration. We have unique portfolio of competencies and data technology as well as clinical insights and actually our ability to manage clinical interactions just continues to advance across this business which is reinforcing that capability in our business.  And our line services have never been positioned to produce greater value for society, for clients, consumers. You can hear us talking a lot more around cite of return in the triple aim and then also becoming more of consumer oriented company which is really what MPS signifies. So, just maybe to wrap up, this is a very scaled improving model. It has a deep management team with strong continuity. It\u2019s largely 95% domestic.  So we really don\u2019t have tariff, Brexit or other global concerns and it is a long runway for growth. It has five well-defined high performing growth pillars that are going to meet in the $11 trillion global market in 2025. So we like the opportunity that is presented and we believe that whether it\u2019s a political sentiment or economic sentiment, this UnitedHealth Group will continue to provide distinctive results and returns both for society as well as our shareholders. \nScott Fidel: Okay, thanks. \nDavid Wichmann: Next question please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nA.J. Rice : Hi everybody. I was just going to ask, I know at the Investor Day you guys talked quite a bit about the initiative around specialty pharmacy and the acquisitions as well as putting infusion in your prime \u2013 in MedExpress and in some community centers. Can you just sort of update us on where you are at today in rolling all of that out? And sort of a timeframe over how you would \u2013 where you might look into next year or so? And what does that mean for you financially?\nDavid Wichmann: Andrew Witty?\nAndrew Witty: Hi, A.J., thanks very much for the question. Make a couple of comments and I am going to ask John Prince to give you a little bit more detail. I\u2019ve been thrilled with the progression of the businesses that you\u2019ve described I think within the pharmacy care services business that John runs as well as within OptumHealth that Andrew runs within these high quality ambulatory care facilities of the type you described really being embraced strongly in the marketplace.  I would continue to expect to rollout and extend those networks over the next several years. I would just make a further point though. I think it\u2019s really important to think about Optum really as a portfolio of provider networks. So if you think about it, it\u2019s not just about an ambulatory care services like SPA, like the infusion centers, like MedExpress.  But if those things complemented by such a strong medical provider network in key markets across the U.S. and what you are going to see over the next few years is aiming to bring to life the value of that network, really comprehensive presence that we are now beginning to establish in a series of important markets, we think that can really deliver substantial convenience, quality, lower cost, better service for the patients we serve as well as the plan sponsors that we serve. With that, let me just hand over a bit more specificity to John.\nJohn Prince : Great, thanks, Andrew and thanks, A.J. for the question. It\u2019s John Prince. In terms of those businesses, especially infusion, we really like that space. We have a very differentiated offering in the market focused on decreasing the total cost of care and also improving the consumer health. We\u2019ve got focus programs clinically that handle our patients through their whole course of treatment.  We\u2019ve done a great job by transforming the consumer experience as well as the provider experiences on close partnerships between the consumer and the provider as you manage course of treatment. We are continuing to grow extensively in the external market taking business both directly with plan sponsors but also continuing in the open market.  So, more than a quarter of our business comes from this open market. People selecting our services as their preferred offering because of our MPS and our clinical outcomes. We added \u2013 we are now over 50 sites in terms of those businesses.  Within the United States we have a significant expansion. We are looking at more of a dozen that are in this coming year and a dozen in the future all in from our portfolio of pharmacy care services. We have over 500 sites as we add in general and other deployments. So, strong performance and strong opportunity. \nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, A. J. Next question? Sorry. Thank you, A. J. Next question please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nFrank Morgan : Good morning. I think you actually commented about this a little bit at the Investor Day with regard to the loss of the Cigna book of business, I think you commented that it would be a revenue hit but really not a profit hit and just any additional color on why that is and does that also assume any type of operational deleveraging with that lost revenue? Thanks. \nDavid Wichmann: John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Frank, good morning. It\u2019s John Rex here. So, yes, you are absolutely correct. I did commented at that at the Investor Conference in terms of the potential for that business to transition over the next couple of years and indeed that\u2019s clearly is the expectation here.  As I commented, that would have a impact on revenue and script counts as that transitions and that really depends on the timing and that timing isn\u2019t completely certain yet in terms of the pacing of that and we are going to work with our customer in terms of meeting their needs on that piece.  I did also commented it wouldn\u2019t have any impact on our earnings outlook for 2019 and that continues to be the case that it doesn\u2019t have any impact on our earnings outlook. So, that\u2019s to be determined in terms of how it impacts our revenue and script count as we work with our customer Cigna on this. \nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Frank. Next question please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. \nJosh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Here with Eric as well. And question on Optum. Rewind about 2.5 years ago, you guys had a couple of really big wins, Summer '16 with CalPERS and Texas employees, GE, et cetera. And I know a lot of that all kicked off on 1/1/2017 and multi-year deals on all of those. But you probably got close to two years of data on it at this point and so I am curious what that data is showing in terms of the impact of synchronization.  There were some targets \u2013 financial targets within those contracts. So, how you are tracking on those? And when do you think you kind of come to market with a little bit more of a definitive study on \u2013 here is what the world look like in these accounts prior to the synchronization and here is what the impact is looking like under the OptumRx contract?\nDavid Wichmann: John Prince?\nJohn Prince: Thanks, Josh. This is John Prince with OptumRx. I\u2019d say \u2013 not again the details on specific customers, I would say overall, we are continuing to execute very well with our \u2013 for our customers. That story around synchronization and which we sold few those customers a couple of years ago was just part of our broader story to the market today.  So, today when we talk about going to market, we talk about how we are negotiating lower cost of care. We are focused on lowering the total cost of care, improving the health outcomes as well as transforming the consumer experience. That is our core value story. When we talk about the $20 to $25 of value that we deliver for our highest performing clients, that is part of our overall book of business in terms of how we serve our customers. So we actually have a lot of the data.  That is then leveraging to our story in the market today. So we actually are coming with strong confidence and by our ability to execute and we are in the market now with things around drug trend and how we can actually reduce drug trend. We are actually out there with total cost to care of guarantees in the market and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve done the definitive study.  We\u2019ve been in a market for five years with the same story and we are executing well and we are on the next generation of it. So we are confident how we are performing. \nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for the question, Josh. Next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead. \nRalph Jacoby : Thanks. Good morning. We are calculating MLR higher by the 90 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year normalizing for the HIF. If that's all Medicaid, it is a pretty massive uptick for a company your size and we just haven\u2019t seen this magnitude of pressure from others in the space.  So, I guess, I am just trying to get a sense if it\u2019s unique this puts us like markets you are in than others are and if it\u2019s unique to you in terms of adverse risk within those populations. Just trying to sort of get a sense and reconcile on that and maybe if you can help just with where your pretax margins are within Medicaid at this point and what kind of improvement do you expect in 2019? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks, Ralph. I am \u2013 we are not seeing the same that you are on the MLR calc. So, why don\u2019t we just circle back with you separately on that as it relates to the Medicaid business that is profitable. It\u2019s not at our target margin range of 3% to 5%.  I would like to see us get into the bottom-end of that range in 2019, will that point be within that range solidly in the 2020 time period and we can say with confidence that that\u2019s the case, based upon the great advocacy actions that we have taken so far, as well as a number of the clinical engagements and operating cost initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place.  Also want to let you know this business functions very effectively. It has mid-60s NPS scores for the traditional Medicaid population when you get into the duals, it\u2019s into the 70s. It\u2019s often times number one in terms of quality scoring in its local markets. It\u2019s referenceable by all the states. So, I don\u2019t want to overplay Medicaid here.  We have a short-term issue that take us a little bit of time to work our way out of. Again, we\u2019ve been working on this most of 2018. Became more acute in the first half, really in the second quarter, but we\u2019ve been working hard on it since and you\u2019ve probably seen some of those rate actions flow through. You can probably see that in some of the statutory filings, some of the improvements and some of these states and I think you\u2019ve probably be able to recognize where they are and how isolated it is in our capacity than as a company to be able to turn that around.  So, we have a lot of confidence in where we are at which is what led by Heather Cianfrocco. She is a fantastic leader and we will \u2013 here team will continue to make good progress on this through 2019.  Thank you, Ralph. Next question please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nGary Taylor : Hi, good morning. I guess, MLR will be the theme of the day. I apologize. Maybe could you give us a little help just thinking about seasonality in your MLR and if that's changed? So when we look at third quarter to fourth quarter in 2016, MLR was pretty flat; and in 2017, it was up 50 BPS and this quarter, up 110, but more like 170 if you exclude the prior year development.  So it does seem like there has been a trend where you've seen more of an increase in the 4Q even as the years come in line. So would you attribute most of that to just some of the seasonality in the commercial business that you've talked to with higher co-pays and deductibles over the years? Or is there something else in the line of business mix that might be contributing to the higher MLRs in the 4Q?\nDavid Wichmann: Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Thanks, Gary. This is Dan Schumacher. So, maybe provide a little bit of context around the commercial seasonality. As you look sort of first quarter to fourth quarter, the change in that medical care ratio generally is somewhere in that 6%, 7%, 8% zone as you move from the first to fourth quarter.  I would tell you if you look 2017 versus 2018, there is probably been somewhere around a one point shift in that as you look at greater concentration in offering that drive consumption towards the fourth quarter, as well as the increases in the average deductibles.  And if you look inside of our average deductible increases over the last two years or so has been in the 8%, 9% zone. So, those are the contributing factors that are going to push the consumption and the realization of that towards the fourth quarter and I think that\u2019s what you are seeing inside of it.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Gary. Next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nLance Wilkes : Yes, I wanted to ask a question on the cross-sales and the specialized benefits focus you guys have. And just related to that, you spoke about dental, vision and just kind of additional coverage as being an area of focus. Want to understand how much of a focus was cross-sales or PBM, stop loss and other care management operations as well?\nDavid Wichmann: Okay. Dan, do you want to take that?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thank you, Lance. Obviously, our ambition is to serve the needs of our clients and we know that when we have the opportunity to really combine the full capabilities of our enterprise taking our knowledge and knowhow with respect to medical offering underpinned by high performing care delivery assets both OptumCare as well as third-party bring in our advocacy and navigation competencies from OptumHealth, our knowhow and intelligence from OptumInsight and then have a chance to take on the ancillary offerings that really contribute to the overall health and well-being of a person that we have our best results and outcomes.  So, we are no doubt very focused on trying to combine both our medical and our pharmacy, take on stop loss, adding care management advocacy, navigation in support of people along with the ancillary coverage and we are making some nice progress in that regard and we\u2019ve got a lot of upside frankly as you look our penetration rates particularly up market in pharmacy we\u2019ve got a lot of room to be able to serve our clients in a more fulsome way. \nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Lance. Next question please?\nOperator: Going next to Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. \nSteve Willoughby : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Moving off to MLR for a bit, my question just revolves around some of the new commercial initiatives you\u2019ve talked about such as buying Colorado Doctors and NexusACO, just wondering if you could give us any perspective on the potential membership gains from these programs either in 2019 or 2020?\nDavid Wichmann: Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thank you, Steve. Maybe just to step back a little bit, from our perspective, we are glad you caught it. We are excited about our efforts to deliver greater value for people and I think as Dave mentioned, we really think that we are on the forefront of a wave of innovation and you named some of those. We see some modest contributions from those efforts in 2019 and increasing efforts in 2020 and beyond.  Nexus has been around a little longer and more evolved. We had about 75,000 folks in 2018 as we turn into the year, we will increase that nicely and by the end of the year we expect to more than double that. As it relates to Colorado Doctors Plan and Bind as an example, I would say they are on the early end of it. So, again, smaller contributions to our enrollment table in 2019 and growing contributions in 2020.  But again, like the suite of offerings that we are bringing to market as well as the interest from the clients perspective.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Steve. Next question please?\nOperator: Going next to Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nSteve Valiquette : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So, from the January 2019, Medicare advantage membership data that just came out overnight, I know some investors look at these sequential trends versus December, others will look at the year-over-year growth trends. I know it\u2019s early, but we are calculating that at least versus January of 2018 that United grew its total Medicare advantage membership almost 10% and the individual MA membership was up almost 11%.  So, I guess, the key is that, one could hypothetically suggest that this is trending slightly above the midpoint of the growth, you kind of suggest of 2019 back in November which is obviously positive. So I guess, I am just curious to take your temperature, I just think there is going to be a bias to the upside for your MA membership growth in 2019. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Brian Thompson, address that.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, Steve. Hi, Brian Thompson. Thanks for the question. 2019 is off to the start that we had expected, real strong start from our advantage point and I would say what AEP suggests is a performance certainly in line with our full year range. Our share of our growth does suggest some share again, which would be the fifth year for us consecutively with we are certainly very pleased with.  I think as we talked about in the past, 2019 environment really provided an opportunistic opportunity to really grow meaningfully. I think we took advantage of improving our benefits, but I would also suggest that we were very cautious and very disciplined in that regard, and established our benefit positioning and our capabilities for 2019 with an eye for long-term stability certainly cognizant of the potential return of the health insurance tax in 2019.  So, really pleased with our positioning and again I think it aligns really nicely with what we had expected. So really a strong start to 2019.\nSteve Valiquette : Okay, great. \nDavid Wichmann: Okay. Thank you, Steve. Next question please.\nOperator: Going next to Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nMichael Newshel : Thanks. John, can you just break down the favorable reserve development intra-year versus anything prior year and I think prior year was lower negative than past quarters. So, is that pattern consistent, and this quarter's development is all underlying 2018 performance?\nJohn Rex : Sure Michael. John Rex here. Yes, we had $280 million of total favorable development 4Q, that breaks down $170 million current year, $110 million prior year. I'd call the favorable development, it's really indicative of that cost containment efforts across our businesses and across the enterprise. I don\u2019t know how material I put it in the context of $145 billion in medical spend overall and it continues to be our objective to manage that well to improve accuracy.  We have increasing level of electronic data exchange early detection of hotspots and really more ability to intervene. But we should have increasing accuracy with that and as it relates to kind of our cost containment efforts, some of those they will across in different forms, some of them very near-term, some of them take a little bit longer to achieve. So, sometimes you see a little different mix in terms of prior year and current year. \nMichael Newshel : Thank you. \nDavid Wichmann: Thanks Michael. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nDavid Windley : Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. A question on John Rex\u2019s EPS cadence commentary. I understood, you would say the 48%, as has been in the past but more in the first quarter. So I just wanted to clarify that you are comfortable \u2013 or you are guiding us to the 48% in the first half, but more than in the first quarter. Is that how we are to interpret your comments? Thanks. \nDavid Wichmann: Dave, thanks for the question. Here is how we view it. So, from year-to-year, individual quarters cannot be impacted by simple factors. I\u2019d call those out as such as that pacing of when weekends or holidays fall. As we all know the yearly calendar is fairly stable. So it\u2019s just typically a matter of differences in quarters and as you would realize those variations are most impactful to the UHC benefits businesses.  So in 2019, the first quarter has slightly fewer work days than the first quarter 2018. In addition, given the timing of share-based compensation awards and how that impacts our tax rate, we generally also expect the first quarter to have the lowest effective tax rate of the year.  So, perhaps without getting overly prescriptive and you are right about the kind of 48% mix in terms of how we see the first half playing out and that is still consistent, but without getting overly prescriptive and without knowing all of your models, I\u2019d suggest something roughly in the range of a 1% shift of your full year earnings outlook would be more appropriately recognized in the first quarter.\nDavid Windley : Thank you. \nDavid Wichmann: All right. Thank you, David. Are there any other questions?\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions. I\u2019ll return the floor to you Mr. Wichmann for final comments. \nDavid Wichmann: Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate all the questions today. To sum up, the company delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2018 contributing genuine value to the people. We are privileged to serve and to society at large. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the 300,000 people of the UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare for their good work.  We are confident in the fundamentals of our businesses and expect to deliver solid operating and earnings performance in 2019. The opportunity is ahead in 2020 and beyond are exciting. There is a remarkable potential for us to serve more people in more ways every day, growing our businesses in the U.S. and worldwide and continuing to provide consistent reliable results for you our shareholders.  Thank you.\nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports & SEC Filings section of the company\u2019s Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 16, 2018, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company\u2019s Web site. I would now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we reported strong operating and financial results across our enterprise. Those results provide a sense of the capacity to advance growth within our businesses, capacities rooted in the breadth and adaptability of our business approach and above all in our mission helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Executing on this mission produces real value for the people we serve and for society in the U.S. and globally through higher quality healthcare delivery with better outcomes, at lower costs leading to improved consumer satisfaction. Executing on our mission also produces steadily advancing growth and financial value. Third quarter revenues grew 12% to $56.6 billion, and third quarter adjusted earnings per share grew 28% to $3.41. We now expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share to approach $12.80, growth of about 27%. This increases our outlook by $0.17 [ph] per share from the midpoint of our range last quarter. These results are grounded and persistently applying three core competencies; information, technology, and clinical insights across our businesses. At no time in our history has our work in these three competencies held more promise than today as they powerfully combine to unlock healthcare value for those we serve. We organize and align data both clinical and administrative around the healthcare consumer using proprietary tools and technologies which evaluate data and care patterns against evidence-based guidelines. Pairing highly personalized data and best known science, we offer next best action for consumers while providing them full transparency into the quality and cost of services offered by their local health systems. We engage our own clinical care resources as well to directly support consumers\u2019 individual healthcare needs. We further use data to improve compliance with evidence-based medicine raising overall satisfaction with care and reducing unnecessary resource consumption. We increasingly do this through employed and affiliated integrated care teams, and in more ambulatory care settings sharing this knowledge at critical points of decision making. Building and applying these competencies persistently to serve each individual we touch, the broader communities and societies we are part of, and you our shareholders requires thoughtful continuing investment internally and in alignment with others through well-developed research and development, venture, and M&A capacities. You can see the broad impact of these competencies in each of our five growth pillars. In care delivery, we use data analytics in concert with our knowledge of local market clinical performance to get patients to the best doctors, care pathways, and sites of service for particular conditions, and to inform development of value-based care arrangements for our employed and affiliated-care providers. Increasingly, these are shared risks and performed-based relationships. In consumer-centric health benefits, information is powering modern product designs to fortify performance networks, tools, and incentive programs to advance quality and engagement improving appropriate consumer access while reducing the cost of healthcare. Specific examples include our new on-demand healthcare and Colorado Doctors Plan offerings and our designs for the duly eligible and Medicare advantage participants. All of these hold promise for continued growth across our benefits businesses. You see it in pharmacy-care services where we have integrated medical and pharmacy information and provide point-of-care technologies to simplify administration, improve drug selection and adherence, and reduce not only pharmacy costs but medical care costs as well, all increasingly within the clinical workflow of doctors. You see it in digital health where our consumer digital health platform Rally is now serving over 20 million registered users. Rally is synthesizing information and engaging people to better manage their health, helping consumers save money by selecting the highest quality care providers, understanding their out-of-pocket costs upfront, and in some markets even scheduling appointments for care. We will soon be releasing at scale, a first-of-kind fully integrated and fully portable individual health record that delivers personalized next best health actions to people and their caregivers. And finally in global healthcare, we are bringing payment integrity analytics and network and product innovations to key private healthcare markets in South America in support of both our health benefits businesses as well as our extensive care delivery operations. These are just a few examples of how we deploy these core competencies in our businesses. Taken more broadly, they give you a sense of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s potential to drive distinctive, constructive change, sustained growth and performance for those we serve. Now let me turn it to Andrew Witty to build on these comments and to update on our Optum businesses. Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Dave. Taking a mission and competency approach enables us to think more deeply and holistically about the healthcare landscape. At Optum we are focused on building and developing a broad set of capabilities which support our vision of delivering better healthcare more affordably. We\u2019re still early in the journey of releasing the full potential of our assets in both the digital and local care environments. Optum will lead by offering deeply customer focused, simple to access high quality healthcare actions and options. We are seeing extensive opportunities to build out our capacities and are committed to stepping up our pace of innovation on behalf of our clients and consumers. Looking at third quarter results, our revenues grew $2.5 billion over last year to 25.4 billion with growth accelerating to 11% from 9% in the second quarter. This revenue advance was again well balanced with strong growth rates from both internal and unaffiliated customers consistent with recent quarters. Our metrics were indicative of this growth across the businesses. OptumRx fulfilled 331 million scripts in the quarter generating revenue growth in excess of 9%. OptumHealth served 92 million people with revenues increasing over 15%, and OptumInsight backlog grew nearly 13% to $15.7 billion at quarter end. Themes of productivity and operational excellence continued in the third quarter as Optum\u2019s operating margin of 8% increased 60 basis points over last year with each business strongly expanding operating margins year-over-year and sequentially. Earnings from operations grew $334 million or nearly 20% to $2 billion with strength across OptumHealth, OptumInsight, and OptumRx. This continues a long-standing trend of proportionally greater Optum earnings in the second half of the year and positions us well for 2019. The businesses of OptumHealth engage people in their health and wellbeing, help them manage their health conditions and increasingly provide care through our high-value clinicians and care delivery sites. Growth at OptumHealth continued to be led by the development of the care delivery businesses as a primary care driven ambulatory care system. OptumCare provides primary care in 35 priority markets and serves 80 health plans and 14 million people, up 2.6 million patients or 23% compared to a year ago. Patient growth was driven by increases in our high-value sites of service businesses and growth in our existing primary care markets. And yet, many of our local efforts remain in an early investment stage. Building out this high-performing ambulatory care system will occupy for the next decade as we progressively deliver significantly improved outcomes, quality, and value to patients. At OptumInsight, we serve health plans, care providers, life science organizations, and governments with data analytics, insights, and innovative solutions to make better decisions and investments and to better manage performance and quality in their cost structures. Over the past several years, we have focused on further development and growth of our care provider services and capabilities, an area where we see meaningful opportunity. Here in particular I\u2019d note revenue management, outsourcing solutions and data analytics and advisory services as important contributors to our recent growth. I\u2019m enthusiastic about OptumRx and its differentiated integrated pharmacy care services approach. This business enables us increasingly to advance high quality, high value specialty pharmaceutical, e-commerce and site of service initiatives combined with convenient local market dispensing all centered on whole person care. Launching the nation\u2019s first ever scaled application of pharmacy discounts and a point of sale will further improve the value consumers receive. We are actively supporting efforts at HHS and CMS to transform pharmacy pricing by engaging in Part B drug and site of service management, formulary approaches and other initiatives to bring better healthcare value for people. OptumRx is becoming increasingly diversified and capable meeting consumers where their needs are greatest with growing contributions from specialty medical management to directly serve in high needs patients with critical access and adherent services through community-based dispensing and delivery, to offer fulfillment services for limited distribution specialty drugs. I see OptumRx is a champion of the consumer in an area where it\u2019s difficult for individuals to have a truly effective voice. Through our depth of insight data and clinical capabilities, we can help inform and amplify their voice. Within our pharmacy care services approach stands an immense opportunity to transform what has been a challenging area of the health system and positively impact people\u2019s lives. While it\u2019s early in my time at Optum, I\u2019m struck by the sheer size and depth of the opportunity, resource and in capacity Optum has to drive extraordinary innovation across healthcare making people healthier and healthy make healthcare systems work better. After more than three decades in healthcare, I\u2019ve never seen an organization with the potential of Optum. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO.\nSteve Nelson: Thank you, Andrew. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s market position is supported by a foundation of consumer value drawn from the breadth and diverse array of health benefit choices, competitive costs, distinctive care quality and market response of consumer service. Together, these deliver stability, peace of mind and value to the nearly 50 million people we serve. Our agenda is to drive a higher NPS and increased value by advancing our service experience, market leading innovations and the total cost of care. Our approach and mindset across the enterprise enable UnitedHealthcare to serve each individual with compassion while addressing the evolving healthcare needs of society driving growth and returns for shareholders. In the third quarter, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew to $45.9 billion, an increase of 5.2 billion over last year and accelerating to 13% growth. Over the past 12 months, we have been privileged to serve 2.8 million more people by way of organic growth and an expanded presence in South America. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s earnings from operations were $2.6 billion with a 5.6% operating margin. Overall, medical cost trends remain well managed, predictable and consistent with expectations. In operations, we\u2019re delivering a better and more modern consumer and care provider experience while driving productivity and affordability improvements in our cost structure through technology, better processes and the benefits of growth and scale. In UnitedHealthcare Medicare and retirement, we continue to innovate and grow. UnitedHealthcare served 125,000 more people through Medicare Advantage offerings in the third quarter, including the 65,000 members of Peoples Health in Louisiana, the highest Medicare star quality plan in that state. We expect strong growth again next year. With the 2019 marketing fees now underway, we\u2019re receiving positive feedback on our new offerings from brokers and consumers. This year more than 50 million people nationwide will have a choice of multiple plans from UnitedHealthcare. And we\u2019re emphasizing our stability and value for seniors. Well more than 90% of our current Medicare Advantage members, more than 4.5 million people, will see either no premium increase or a premium decrease even as we provide personalized navigation, introduce new value-added benefits at no additional costs and increase and modernize access for seniors to fitness and wellness services, virtual visits and reliable transportation for medical appointments. Today, Medicare Advantage programs serve only about 20 million people nationally and a growing senior population of 60 million people. We deliver Medicare medical benefits at an average cost that is more than 20% lower than original Medicare with cost in our higher performing markets as much as 30% below our original Medicare. We convert these cost advantages into highly valued benefits and services for seniors filling the significant gaps in coverage within original Medicare. Our programs focused on higher acuity populations like Medicare Advantage remain an extraordinary growth opportunity for UnitedHealthcare, because we can offer such strong value. UnitedHealthcare employer and individual group served 65,000 more people through risk-based commercial products in the third quarter. Our growing market share in fully insured products in recent years reflects our rising NPS with customers, consumers, care provider partners and our distribution partners. Strong customer retention rates and the increasing value we deliver with consumer-centric products, tailored networks and greater consumer engagement are important drivers of growth. In 2019 and 2020, we expect to introduce additional products supported by performance networks and we\u2019ll launch advanced digital capabilities providing even greater personalization, simplicity and value for consumers. In UnitedHealthcare Community & State, growth over the past year was led by higher need and therefore higher revenue membership such as those who were duly eligible and participate in long-term services and support programs. Medicaid membership grew organically by 5,000 people in the quarter, offset by the divestiture of our plan representing 85,000 community-based members in New Mexico. We continue to focus on delivering value to our state partners by advancing health and improving our total cost of care and operating cost positions in Medicaid. At UnitedHealthcare Global, our integrated delivery systems, primary care health center model and progressive use of information and technology are creating value for our customers in South America. We continue our disciplined approach of pricing health benefits to their expected costs and our hospitals in Brazil continue to improve their performance as measured by health outcomes, NPS and financial returns. UnitedHealthcare Global is creating value with our Medicare colleagues in Chile, Peru and Colombia with early progress in population health management, clinical management and analytic capabilities. Initial focus areas include the adoption of evidence-based clinical guidelines and site of care strategies for high utilizing patients. Looking ahead, we expect sustained strong growth and improved earnings performance from UnitedHealthcare. Our investments in innovative products, capabilities and the consumer experience will increasingly be brought to market even as we focus on delivering market leading total cost of care, and we believe UnitedHealthcare is uniquely positioned to serve in the high growth, higher acuity submarkets like Medicare Duals or patients with complex and chronic conditions. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Steve. To bring all the previous comments together, this morning we reported 56.6 billion in third quarter revenues, growth of 12.4% over last year. Earnings from operations of 4.6 billion grew 12.3% on strong operating margins of about 8%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $3.41. Third quarter adjusted cash flows were 6.1 billion or 1.9x net income. Of note, we made a $2.6 billion payment to the U.S. treasury in October 1 for our customers\u2019 portion of the nation\u2019s health insurance tax for 2018, which will factor into our fourth quarter cash flow results. With nine months of 2018 complete, our original outlook for commercial medical cost trend of 6% plus or minus 50 basis points is biasing just slightly lower than 6%. In the third quarter, our consolidated medical care ratio of 81% compares to 81.4% in the year-ago quarter and reflects the impact of the health insurance tax offset by changes in business mix and development. Medical reserve developed favorably in the quarter by 50 million. Within that result, we had approximately 120 million of favorable development for 2018 and 70 million in unfavorable prior year development. Our third quarter operating cost ratio of 15% increased only 30 basis points over last year despite bearing about 1 percentage point of cost increase from the return of the health insurance tax as well as higher investments in innovation and business development. We offset that pressure with operating expense discipline across the board and strong revenue growth in lower operating cost ratio businesses such as Medicare and Medicaid. Turning to our balance sheet. Return on equity for the third quarter reached nearly 26% and our debt to total capital ratio was 38.9% at September 30. We have repurchased 3.7 billion of stock year-to-date for approximately $233 per share and we continue to apply capital to our businesses through M&A, venture investments and organic development to strengthen our offerings for customers and further diversify our enterprise. Taken together, our strong and diversified growth, disciplined cost management and strategic use of capital are combining to produce another year of meaningful financial performance. As Dave mentioned, we now expect 2018 adjusted earnings approaching $12.80 per share, growth of approximately 27%. Dave?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. As we closed out the third quarter, attention naturally turns to 2019. We will reserve the majority of this conversation for our November 27 Investor conference but I can offer a few high-level observations at this time. The environment in 2019 will contain as always a mix of elements common to the broad marketplace and those unique to us. Overall, our individual businesses are building from a fundamentally strong foundation and we continue to create strong momentum then again to next year. We will continue to advance NPS supporting continued growth across our businesses. Our accelerating investment levels will fund the delivery of compelling innovations in 2019 and 2020. And as we evaluate the many opportunities we see over the next number of years, we believe our long-term performance will remain aligned with our long-term goal of earnings per share growth of 13% to 16%. We enter 2019 with energy and optimism for the future and I would offer at this distance the current market consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share captures our 2019 outlook within a typically sized range. As always, we will seek to perform to our full potential. Advancing distinctive, constructive change in healthcare is an enormous and complex undertaking. We believe we have a lot to offer advancing more value for consumers while mitigating cost for those who pay for care. Our strategies do not depend or reside on a single piece of technology, database, distribution system, clinical approach, funding mechanism or any other singular view of what it takes to make a durable and meaningful difference in healthcare. Rather our potential resides in the combination of our diverse market presence, our data, technology and clinical competencies, the compassion, integrity and deep healthcare knowledge and skills of our nearly 300,000 people, the millions of trusted relationships we have earned over time and our understanding of and full alignment to the rapidly advancing standards of performance, individuals and health systems worldwide demand from their healthcare. Our people in this deeply motivated, restless, diverse and adaptable leadership team are fully engaged in improving value for society and delivering consistent distinctive financial results. Let me close now and open up the call to your questions. One question per person please, so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you. Good morning. If you could comment on your outlook for the Medicare open enrollment season, and just within that, the trend in 2018 has been very heavily skewed in favor of the large public companies. I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on that as it relates to prior years, and if you expect that to continue. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Matt, thank you for your question. Obviously, it\u2019s an area of strength for our organization. We have performed exceptionally well in growing in the Medicare Advantage market, both the individual as well as serving group accounts as well. It takes a lot of planning and execution. Our team is very strong in that regard, and I think we expect a very nice result to develop for 2019 as well. Let me ask Brian Thompson to add to that.\nBrian Thompson: Thanks, Dave. Brian Thompson here. Yes, Matt, '19 is shaping up as a really great year I think for seniors at large and the MA industry. Specifically, we are certainly optimistic about our products and how they compare, what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace is consistent with our expectation and certainly gives us confidence about our positioning. We expect to drive another very strong year of MA growth and continue our momentum that we\u2019ve demonstrated now for several years. I think as we approach the year, what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace looks like what we had expected, very pleased with our position, really no surprises, and I think you can expect more growth from us in 2019.\nMatthew Borsch: All right, thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. First on that, I apologize, on the Medicare Advantage, the CMS is estimating 11.5% growth for next year. Just curious if you agree with that. And then my question\u2019s really on the PBM side. You acquired two specialty pharmacies in the quarter. I wanted to get your updated view on the PBM business given all the debate in the sector around the sustainability of margins and economics in general and the future of rebates in particular. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Justin. Of course, we have our own points of view about what we expected the growth rate to be in the Medicare Advantage market, and of course CMS\u2019 number was quite a bit higher than that. I think we\u2019re still indexed on a lower expectation, but we certainly would be pleased to see that growth rate overall. Brian, if you have anything to add to that.\nBrian Thompson: No, I think you said it right, Dave. As we\u2019ve said in previous quarters, we look at the long-term industry growth rate for MA more in that 7% to 8% range. As I said last quarter, Justin, our planning is certainly to outpace that rate as we have now for four or five years. As Dave said, a lot of optimism but a lot of ranges around what the growth rate might be for 2019. I don\u2019t think it will be instructive for us to chime in on what that percentage might be, but certainly optimistic, certainly reasons for it to strengthen and we\u2019re pleased with how we\u2019re positioned as we approach '19.\nDavid Wichmann: And a very insightful question also, Justin, on the specialty pharma acquisitions. We are very excited about those. There\u2019s a lot of adaptability for those across multiple aspects of our business. Andrew Witty, would you like to comment?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Dave. So again, thanks for the question. Yes, during the quarter we acquired both Avella and Genoa, both of which are going to be potentially very important additions to our specialty pharmacy portfolio. They made very small contribution in the quarter itself, but going forward we see them offering distinctive contributions in the behavioral space as well as in the specialty, particularly the oncology space. To your more general question around the role and the importance of PBMs, I think it\u2019s important to reflect on really the fundamental role the PBM offers which is to aggregate volume and to ensure a pricing discipline within the pharmaceutical sector without which there really wouldn\u2019t be any kind of discipline around drug price increasing phenomenon. As you know, drug companies are free to increase prices at will. The PBM acts as a mechanism to discipline that process. Historically, that\u2019s been through the rebating mechanism. As we look forward, we\u2019re ready for whatever evolution of that marketplace might take place. The diversification of the OptumRx portfolio into a really diversified portfolio of pharmacy services is really displayed in its continued growth rate, development of the Briova infusion business as one example. We\u2019ve seen a significant set of positive evolution there. To the degree to which there is change in the PBM environment, I\u2019d come back to my first point. It\u2019s critical that any environment ensures that there is a disciplining mechanism for price increases in the U.S., and whether that\u2019s through rebate or any other mechanism, we\u2019re ready to engage with whatever changes might come along.\nDavid Wichmann: So, Justin, I may just add. You probably noticed or the markets have noticed a pivot for us from a PBM to a pharmacy care services-based business, and I know we\u2019ve been talking about that for some time, but more increasingly over the course of the last couple of years or so, with Andrew here \u2013 Andrew Witty, he\u2019s taken an actually modernized and advanced set approach even more so for us really enhancing our thinking in this area, and I think what you can expect from us is that we\u2019ll be deeply thoughtful about how we engage and participate broadly but also have confidence that we\u2019ll navigate through this change similar to the way we have across other changes in healthcare in the past. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Hi. Thanks. I want to go back to MA if I can and really just thoughts about the margins sustainability in that business, it seems like every company is really looking to grow MA as a key driver going forward, every company seems to talk about growing faster than the industry and I think the CMS comments about 11% number I think is to some degree driven by the view that companies are largely improving benefits which all else equal I guess would imply margin compression. So we\u2019d just love to hear your thoughts about how competitive that marketplace is and the ability to kind of maintain margins and grow the way that you\u2019re targeting over time?\nDavid Wichmann: It\u2019s a great question, Kevin. Obviously, we have great confidence in our ability to sustain our margins and continue to grow the business. It has always been a competitive marketplace and clearly there\u2019s a lot of new entrance into that market as well. I think those new entrance in the competitive field make us just that much better. We\u2019ve had some distinctive capacities in this category and I think that that what makes us different and really enhances our ability to continue to grow and sustain margins by creating real value. And I\u2019ll ask Brian Thompson once again to comment on what some of those capacities are and provide further context.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks, Dave. As Dave said, certainly pleased with the outlook for what we see in 2019 but certainly want to point out the strong momentum that we\u2019ve demonstrated. This is the fourth year of outpacing the industry growth rate quite meaningfully and I think it\u2019s a signal that our value is resonating in the marketplace. Over the last four years, benefit stability as well as the enhancements we\u2019ve added, our focus on a hassle-free agenda taking out the complications for those we serve our service model which we call our Advocate For Me service model, our very popular HouseCalls program, the various care management programs, we have all virtually Optum enabled are really resonating and we\u2019re seeing that value with our members, with our physician partners and our distribution channel at large and we\u2019re really pleased to have that sort of track record and momentum as we enter what\u2019s appearing to be a very optimistic season for seniors.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Kevin. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to shift over to OptumCare. Wondering how you or how many markets do you have substantial build-out where say a material portion of your benefits been on the UnitedHealthcare side in those service areas where you choice to compete would be flowing through OptumCare? What kind of savings do you see from using OptumCare? And then how do you foresee the build-out of subsequent markets, of more markets to that level of influence?\nDavid Wichmann: That\u2019s a great question, Dave. I think the script covered some of that when we were referring to Medicare Advantage products and particularly the value that are created relative to original Medicare and we talked about the upper limits of that being 30% or so savings category. That\u2019s really what we were referring to is the deep relationships that UnitedHealthcare, frankly others have with the OptumCare enterprise which is a fiercely multi-payer business serving many payers as we outlined in the script as well. We have Andrew Hayek here. He\u2019ll answer the balance of your questions.\nAndrew Hayek: Thanks, Dave. So to add to what Dave shared just a high level, we\u2019re really pleased with the performance of OptumCare in terms of improving quality, measured by stars, adhered measures, our consumer experience for averaging in that promoter score of 71 across OptumCare and OptumHealth and the total cost of care savings, savings to be system by driving better health, by preventing avoidable admissions, by practicing evidence-based care. And to Dave\u2019s point when we do these things we\u2019re seeing the savings in the order of magnitude of 30% compared to traditional Medicare in a growing number of our mature markets. As was referenced earlier, we\u2019re present in 30 markets across OptumCare. There are varying levels of depth in those markets but all of them are on the pathway towards value, value-based contracting, value-based clinical programs, culture, how we orient our physicians. We\u2019re deepening our presence in those communities that we serve again at different points along the continuum but we\u2019re all deepening and growing and we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019re in the early stages as Andrew Witty shared of the potential of OptumCare. And as we generate these kinds of results for the communities we serve, the patients we serve and our 80 health plan partners, we see continued and growing interest to enter new markets and to deepen our presence in our current markets.\nDave Windley: Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Dave. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSarah James: Thank you. I wanted to go back to your comment on 2019 looking within the range of the long-term growth which you\u2019ve previously said was 13% to 16%. So there were bullish comments on Medicare and Optum growth and then we have the HIF break, so stacking up to be more tailwinds than headwinds. So can you run us through any headwinds or tailwinds that maybe missing from that and spike out the impact of the HIF tailwind? I think this year it was $0.75 headwind to '18, so how much is it rolling off for the benefit to '19? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Sure, Sarah, thank you. So maybe what I\u2019ll give you a sense of is the generally speaking the headwind and tailwind as we see and then I\u2019ll ask John Rex to cover the HIF which I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of interest in. So generally headwinds end up being matters that are less specific to us so I\u2019ll call them industry-related headwinds, but we certainly have things that are unique to us as well. I think it\u2019s really important always as we think about planning and we\u2019re in the midst of it right now that we always start with a deep respect for medical cost and also around positioning in a conservative posture on pricing to ensure that we fully consider those medical costs in that pricing. Next to that I\u2019d say the sufficiency of government funding is always a concern specifically in an environment where budgets begin to tighten and our population continues to age. That\u2019s going to put pressure broadly on budgets. So our response to that is to continue our extensive advocacy activities that we had in this area to ensure that the voices of those that depend on Medicare and Medicaid are heard and well heard. At the same time you\u2019ve heard a lot of conversation this morning around managing total cost to care and being very restless around driving greater value to the market. So we clearly respond to that sufficiency of government funding call by making sure that our costs are contained and that Medicare consumers in particular receive additional value for their premium dollars. The health insurance tax is an interesting item. I\u2019ll give my take on it first and then as I said I\u2019ll ask John to at the end of this to comment on it as well. But I see it as a negative. I see its return as a negative for people, for the industry, for business, for society broadly. If it returns, the industry is going to need to once again build it into premiums and that\u2019s going to elevate them to a point of dissatisfaction among consumers. We saw that when it came back here for 2018 in particular. It affects our NPS. It causes unnecessary instability for those we serve, particularly our Medicare members who are on fixed income. Beyond that, the rest of the items are pretty unique to us. But I\u2019d call out one in particular which is around the pacing of investments. As you know we have NPS ambitions in this company, we have growth ambitions in this company. We have ideals around how we can add value to the health system broadly over time, so we have new R&D, our research and development capacities. And you\u2019ve heard us talk about a lot of startup base businesses. OptumCare is still a startup, probably midstream in its overall development, something that will take nearly two decades to fully develop. But you also heard us talk about things like buying the Colorado Doctors Plan. And while we didn\u2019t talk about it today, we are also entering into new geographic markets for Medicare and also for our commercial base business and all of those things take deep investment. But they are investments that are necessary in order sustain that long-term and I underscore long-term growth rate 13% to 16% over time. You\u2019re absolutely right. We have a lot of tailwinds and they surpass our headwinds and that\u2019s why we can offer up the strength of that 2019 guidance that we have. Those include advances in NPS cost containment and the innovation that\u2019s a hallmark of this company. All those things continue to fuel growth. We expect a strong year for Medicare Advantage as you heard from Brian. But we also expect continued strong growth in returns from our market competitive commercial offerings. And as I said last quarter, we were a bit dissatisfied with our ability particularly in the national accounts market to advance our self-funded business. I think that\u2019s going to pivot in 2019 and begin to produce growth in 2020. Our Medicaid businesses do very well on the Duals and with the long-term services in sports populations I think they can do a lot better \u2013 perform a lot better with the base Medicaid plans as well. OptumCare is going to enter into more new markets. It\u2019s going to also advance its risk-bearing capacities. We talked about OptumRx. That had a successful season again this year but has a lot of momentum particularly in specialty and delivering considerable supply chain value. OptumInsight\u2019s performing really well on revenue cycle management and cost containment lines and our global businesses continue to expand across both insurance and deliveries. And we\u2019re going to continue to deploy capital in the business and grow as you\u2019ve come to expect from us in the past. So sustaining all that really requires a significant investment and so what we do is we thoughtfully plan about what investment capacities we have so that we can invest and continue to sustain that kind of 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth rate over time. And our idea is to provide the maximum return possible for society and then also our shareholders. With that, maybe I\u2019ll ask John just to touch on the mechanics of the HIF tax as well.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Sarah, good morning. Just a few components here as we think about the HIF tax and our view on it and expectations going into next year that might be instructive. So I think the first thing to recall is when we laid out our initial $0.75 back in November, that was prior to a very important event that occurred later on which was the reduction on the corporate tax rate. That meaningfully muted the impact, the headwind impact of the health insurance headwind for us this year. And I know you\u2019re aware of that one. That\u2019s a significant reduction. There are other true-ups and miscellaneous items as the year goes on but by far in a way that would be the biggest component. So with nine months of actuals now, we size 2018 year-over-year headwind is just over half the level or around half the level we\u2019d initially expected back then, again vast majority to that just due to the corporate tax reduction. As we start considering things and elements for 2019 among things we\u2019ll have to consider and be watchful for is when and how any conclusions are made for the reintroduction of the tax in 2020 also as that would have impact on the 2019 year. So all of them will be in play [ph], but just want to kind of also provide a little guidance on where we think it\u2019s \u2013 the impact it\u2019s had on 2018 also.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question, Sarah. You got probably more than you asked for in the answer.\nSarah James: Fantastic. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Josh, you may be on mute. Josh, are you on mute?\nOperator: We\u2019ll move on and we can go to Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Thanks a lot. I\u2019m looking for an update on the shift from fee-for-service to fee-for-value both in terms of where you guys are at now as well as on the Optum IT side, the systems that you\u2019re delivering to A providers and payers in that move?\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, well I think the shift from fee-for-service to fee-for-value I\u2019ll have Dan Schumacher, President of UnitedHealthcare discuss and then maybe Andrew if you want to tie into that as well.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thank you, Michael, for the question. To your good point, we have long been pursuing the transition and greater orientation towards value over volume. And we\u2019re doing it in a couple of ways. First, trying to get an increasing amount of spend under value-based constructs but then importantly second working to make sure that that spend migrates towards managing the health of the population versus just individual quality metrics. So as you think about each of those components on the amount overall, today we have about $69 million in value-based constructs that represents a little under half of our total medical, surgical spend. And we had set a goal to get to 65 billion and we got there early. So we\u2019ve reset our sights towards $75 billion by 2020. So we\u2019ll continue to progress the total volume of spend that comes under value-based constructs. And then inside that, we\u2019ve been very successful in that migration towards population orientation. If you look at where that sits today, about half of our value-based spend is in the more progressive relationships that orient around population outcomes and that\u2019s up from about 38%, 39% if we look just five years ago. And so we\u2019ve got a lot of focus on deepening of partnerships. Some of our more progressive relationships are actually with our ACO partners and in those relationships we work to share data, share insights, drive better coordination, close gaps and care for people. And as you look at that, we\u2019ve had some very successful outcomes with our ACO partners. In total, we\u2019ve got about 1,000 ACOs underway. And as you look at it across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial, we\u2019re able to drive less in-patient stays, lower readmission rates, more primary care, less ER and more preventive screening. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with our progress there and we continue to do more work and we\u2019ll look to build on it in future.\nDavid Wichmann: So as I think you know, Andrew Hayek and his team in OptumCare in particular are enabling all this by putting the deep infrastructure in local markets from primary care through development of ambulatory care systems to enable the other side of that coin if you will that Dan had just described. So having heard from Andrew, I think we\u2019ll just go to Eric Murphy to put some comments on the Optum IT side.\nEric Murphy: Thanks, Dave, and thanks for the question, Michael. Just piggybacking up on what Dan Schumacher shared is payers and providers continue to shift from fee-for-service to value-based care arrangements. OptumInsight offers the market what we refer to as a plan/build model. On the plan side we\u2019ve got one of the largest advisor consulting services organizations in the healthcare industry where a number of our subject matter experts assist payers and providers with how to build those arrangements so they can move from free-for-service to value-based care. On the build side, we have Optum performance analytics which we\u2019ve talked about many times on this call in the past is one of the market leading platforms to enable payers and providers to not only establish risk-based relationships but really manage both the cost and quality of care. So we see a continued shift in the marketplace from fee-for-service to value-based care and feel very strong about the enablement capabilities of OptumInsight.\nMichael Baker: Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nZachary Sopcak: Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on your experience now on point-of-sale rebates, I think it was about six months ago that you announced that you were going to do it for 2019 for your risk book. How are those clients been taking it? Are they understanding what has to be done to convert to that? And have you seen any increased interest in your fee-based book and going to point-of-sales rebates for 2019?\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question, Zach. It\u2019s obviously very timely one as well given all the news around this. We did back in March \u2013 beginning of March this year make a decision for the 7 million to 8 million people that are in our fully insured employer base business to convert them to a point-of-sale rebate format. I\u2019ll ask Dan Schumacher to comment on that. And then John Prince if you have any observations about how the market is adopting these ideals as well, I\u2019d appreciate it. Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Good morning, Zach. So we did, as Dave mentioned, we announced our change earlier this year and that actually goes into effect beginning 1/1/2019 for all new and renewing groups forward in our fully insured group portfolio. So at this point it\u2019s coming up on 1/1/'19 where we\u2019ll see that roll into place. And the reaction from our customer base and the broker community has been strong. I think it adds a level of transparency to consumers and helps to return the economic incentive associated with the rebates to them at the point of sale and that\u2019s particularly important when people are in high deductible offerings where they\u2019re sharing the first dollar burden of healthcare more broadly. As it relates to our self-funded client base, we continue to see more interest in that offering and obviously they\u2019re trying to think about how it all balances out in the context of how they set their contribution strategy, their benefit strategy that underpins that. But we have seen some more interest. We\u2019ve seen some tick up in sales. And let\u2019s see if John Prince can offer anything from his perspective.\nJohn Prince: Sure, Dan, thanks. It\u2019s John Prince. In terms of the broader market we\u2019ve seen good uptake. We\u2019ve been doing this in a market for several years in terms of our large sophisticated clients. We\u2019ve seen a real fee change this past year with first with UnitedHealthcare doing their fully insured book. We have additional million lives that are picking up in the self-insured market. We also have additional health plan clients that are going to adopt it later in 2019, 2020. In terms of a consumer experience, we\u2019re seeing a value of about $150 of value delivered back to an individual consumer when they have \u2013 when it\u2019s all rebate. So specifically on the high-deductible health plan there\u2019s a lot of value from a consumer experience of doing point-of-sale rebates, but overall very solid uptake.\nZachary Sopcak: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for the question, Zach. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I might take a minute to ask you about your MLR trend in the quarter. You were 81%. That was better than we were thinking and I think better than that consensus. A couple of moving parts there. I guess I\u2019d be interested to hear your comment on first, if there\u2019s any way to flush out a little bit more granularity between the business lines and what you saw in MLR, whether one particularly outperformed or was there any area where you had any issues? And second, I guess in that, the development. We knew that you would not have probably as strong a development as you had last year but we didn\u2019t really assume that you\u2019d have actually the negative of development you had in 2017. Related to 2017, any comment on that? And then I think finally on MLR trend impact, I think last quarter you highlighted that we should be aware that Latin America, particularly Biomedica [ph] have a negative MLR impact in the second and third quarter because of the winter and it\u2019s hard to see that in the combined results. I wonder if that played out like you expected or did you have some unusual favorable trend down there?\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks, A.J. All good questions. In the interest of time I\u2019ll \u2013 it\u2019s just a seasonal adjustment in South America, and so they\u2019re moving into the spring and summer months now. So we\u2019ll definitely see that as we move into Q4 and into Q1. John Rex, would you like to comment on our performance on MLR and development?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, A.J. John Rex here. You had a few comments on that. So I\u2019m going to try to pick up the various components there and hopefully I will hit on them all. One element I heard you refer to was development. In the quarter, so net 50 million of favorable development in the quarter and within that we talked about 120 million of that being in year and 70 million of that relating to prior year. Nothing really significant within those prior year components I would tell you. The way we look at that that\u2019s roughly on $130 billion of medical spend from 2017. So very, very modest within the scheme of things. There\u2019s always different quarters in the year. You get coordination of benefits impact, you get other little impacts that come in, but within the scheme of our medical expense of 0.05%, so relatively modest. I look back over the past three years; so 70 this year, it\u2019s 110 favorable in '17, it was 110 million unfavorable in '16; very small amounts that rolled through there and nothing that significant that I\u2019d point out. In terms of across the lines of business also, nothing really meaningful to point out across the different lines. If I were to bias it just a little bit, I\u2019d bias just slightly to the employer based businesses in terms of where some of that development was occurring in the course of the quarter. You probably heard me comment during my prepared comments that we were biasing our trend outlook in commercial down a bit. And within that in terms of trend, we continue to see really what\u2019s driving most of trend is still unit cost as the main driver versus utilization. And if I were to break down the components in terms of what we\u2019re seeing versus what we staked out back in November in terms of the individual trend components, I\u2019d characterize that probably pharmacy and in-patient are coming at the low end of the expected ranges that we\u2019ve provided at that time.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, that was responsive [ph]. A.J., thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, guys. Maybe just follow up on that just on the commercial side, I guess first it sort of sounds as though medical cost trend may have decelerated during the quarter. Is that a fair read? And if so, can you comment on sort of where you\u2019re seeing the change in the second, if not for the buckets you just sort of listed? And then would also just benefit on any preliminary comments on how the '19 selling season is shaping up in the commercial book and maybe a little bit of your outlook for the cost trend as well as the \u2013 really the cost trend on the forward?\nJohn Rex: Steve, it\u2019s John Rex here again. So with regard to the buckets as I think is what you\u2019re asking in terms of trend, the components where we\u2019re seeing against our initial expectations we laid out back in November were really pharmacy and in-patient in terms of coming at the lower end of the range as it relates to in-patient. It\u2019s been a very long-term decline in in-patient. I think we\u2019ve had nine years or so of declining in-patient utilization. So that has been a long-term trend. But both those components were the buckets where we would have seen the lower end of the range and where we\u2019re seeing some deceleration.\nDavid Wichmann: And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in any particular different place on trend and MLR this quarter versus where we were last. There\u2019s no watershed moment that occurred in the Q3. I think it\u2019s intensely consistent in terms of overall performance as well as \u2013 as we look at how we select our reserves and the development that comes as a result. Dan, you want to pick up the last piece.\nDan Schumacher: Thanks. Steve, I think you asked about how the '19 selling season was shaping up and I assume that that orients towards the self-funded marketplace just given where we sit in the year. I\u2019ll break that into a couple of pieces. As it relates to first the national accounts market segment, as I\u2019ve shared for the last couple of quarters, the theme there is really one around incumbency. We\u2019ve done well to win when given the opportunity but the reality is we do have a larger base that we\u2019re defending inside that. We were successful again this year in converting our retirees to group Medicare offerings. Obviously, those are a strong value for clients and consumers as well as for our enterprise. So for the self-funded portion of the national accounts segment, we do expect enrollment to decline in 2019 and our team is really focused on, as Dave mentioned, redoubling our efforts around total cost of care and importantly, our effectiveness in demonstrating that clearly to clients and consultants. As you look at the broader self-funded market, we continue to perform very well in the middle market segment, so clients with employees up to 3,000. And our public sector performance has seen some very nice improvement for 2019 including some large wins. So when we put that altogether and look at the self-funded market overall, we expect some very strong year-over-year improvement and that should result in a modest growth profile in 2019 and we\u2019d look forward to breaking apart the pieces and discussing it further at the Investor conference in November.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Steve. We have several calls left in the queue and I\u2019d like to see if we can get through this in the next 15 minutes or so, so we\u2019re going to go ahead and take the next question but we\u2019ll probably \u2013 you\u2019ll probably hear us tighten up our responses a bit here. Next question please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRalph Jacoby: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to get a little more clarification on the HIF. Seemingly, you priced it through to customers and the tax \u2013 obviously the tax benefit came after. So it\u2019s sort of the mindset that you have to and you expect to sort of pay it back in 2019, is that why it might not be the sort of the magnitude of tailwind we initially thought or help us think through that? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Yes, Ralph, so in terms of \u2013 focusing on the 2019 aspect or as my comments were specifically related to 2018 and the impact that the reduction in taxes and the corporate tax rate had.\nRalph Jacoby: So that benefited to you essentially in 2018 versus when we price the book. So in 2019, are customers asking for that back or how do we think that through?\nJohn Rex: So that was a significant headwind and that\u2019s part of what came into our earnings outlook when we revised earnings in January. So that a meaningful part of that. And then we did not have to then price on renewing books, have to price that in to any renewing books that were coming on at that point. So significant benefit for our customers in terms of how we approach the market and how we were able to pass on that benefit to our customers. Certainly that\u2019s also a benefit that our customers are receiving in 2019 because of the absence of the HIF and we would hope to also have that benefit as we move into future years. As Dave pointed out, the mere existence of the health insurance tax is a headwind for a healthcare cost. So we look for that to accrue to our customers.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Ralph. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, I\u2019ve got just a question on the PBM and it\u2019s kind of three short points but very tight, don\u2019t worry. The first one is just if you could talk a little bit about the mail penetration rate and how you\u2019re doing with specialty steerage there, how that contrast with prior years. I guess related to that how are you thinking about e-commerce and potentially adding online pharmacy options like Amazon? And then within the context of that if you want to talk a little about PBM sales for 2019 both direct and the cost sales with the large self-funded groups? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. I will direct it straight to John Prince.\nJohn Prince: Great. Lance, it\u2019s John Prince. I\u2019ll cover the selling season first. We\u2019ve had \u2013 we\u2019re just wrapping up the 2019 selling season. If you look at the season we had additional RFP volume, so it was up year-over-year. In terms of client sales, we\u2019ve actually sold more clients in 2019 for a business than we did in 2018 selling season. So we have additional clients year-over-year just in line with our expectations. So we\u2019re excited about our sales. We\u2019ve had a couple of good state wins, a couple of new health plans, unions and as well a couple of large employers. Retention is also very solid if we look into 2019. We\u2019re going to have retention of 98% or higher as we go into 2019 which is three years in a row of solid retention. In terms of the other part of your question which is mail penetration, specialty and e-commerce, that\u2019s really been the driver of our growth over the last year as we\u2019ve been increasing our mail penetration, driving additional specialty volume. We\u2019ve been very successful in winning the open market. Remember the biggest volume of business in specialty and infusion is open sourced in terms of competing in the market. We\u2019ve done a great job of getting a sales force out there competing with a great product, solid NPS from a consumer standpoint and from a division standpoint. We\u2019re just winning better day-in and day-out in terms of in the market and that\u2019s been driving our growth.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for the question, Lance. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMike Newshel: Thanks. We\u2019ve seen a few recent data points suggesting that the trend toward high-deductible plans in the employer business maybe flowing or even peaking. Is that something you\u2019re seeing? And do you think there\u2019s a certain point where employers have already exercised that high-deductible option, will look for new benefit design options? And then what would that look like? Are you seeing any pickup in interest in things like narrow or high-value networks, medical and pharmacy integration, digital wellness tools, things like that?\nDavid Wichmann: You just hit upon all the \u2013 I think some of the primary growth drivers and a lot of employers are looking for in healthcare. High-deductible health plans have been one of the fastest growing product lines out there for some time now having been first introduced back all the way into 2004 I guess it was or maybe '03, maybe even earlier than that for that matter. But the items you just pointed out are the same items that we also labeled in the script. Our work around digital technologies, providing deeply personalized information to consumers, the way in which we drive value-based arrangements to connect incentives across both the continuum of care but also between healthcare consumers and healthcare providers is all \u2013 those are all essential parts of what employers are looking for. They are also looking for tighter levels of integration too. And they are expecting that not only from our benefits business but they\u2019re also expecting it from our services business particularly as we get into healthcare delivery and that\u2019s where the technical solutions and information solutions that OptumInsight offers to both OptumRx as well as to OptumHealth really deeply respond to the demands of that marketplace. And frankly they transcend employer into the Medicare and Medicaid market as well. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up earlier comments when you talking about point-of-sale rebates. Just trying to get a sense on are you guys passing back 100% of rebates to the number at the point of sale or is it maybe some portion of it because my understanding there\u2019s some concerns perhaps from PBMs themselves, right, if you pass back 100%, the retailers can sort of back track into sort of what your rebate arrangements are like. Can you give us a sense a little bit more of the mechanics on how the process works? And then related to that as this market evolves in the PBM space, are you looking at \u2013 can you talk about what types of new pricing models you\u2019re exploring with clients perhaps going more at risk on price in sort of a PMPM model? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Dan, do you want to take that point-of-sale rebate piece because I believe that relates to UnitedHealthcare\u2019s effort effective 1/1/'19 and what percentage of that gets passed back through which is the vast majority of it sans [ph] a holdback for some of the work that we do as well. But anyway anything further to add to that, Dan?\nDan Schumacher: No.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, great. Thanks. Sorry to drain that for you. John, perhaps you want to comment on the second part.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Thank you for the question Charles about the new pricing model. We\u2019ve been out in the market talking about total cost to care for several years which has really resonated in the market. Clients have been interested in how we can guarantee that. So we\u2019ve had models in the market for about two years of total cost to care guarantee. So if they work with us around medical behavioral pharma, around what additional value they can deliver. Another model we\u2019ve been in the market with is also around a trend guarantee around pharmacy. And so we have a variety of models that we\u2019ve been partnering with our more leading-edge clients to develop a solution and deliver that value.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we can go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about something I thought was fairly significant in the prepared comments and wanted to flesh out a little bit. But you had talked about the fully portable electronic health records, soon to be released at scale. I know you\u2019ve talked about that as an ambition for -- on the Rally chassis [ph] I believe. But my two questions would be when and when you say at scale, what lines of business and what parts of the country are we talking about? And then just the last piece, just give us a little bit on the technology. So if I roll in with my Rally EHR and my provider\u2019s on Cerner, Epic or Aetna, how do they actually interface with this portable medical record that I\u2019m coming in with? Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: It\u2019s a great question, Gary, and thank you for it. As outlined in our November 2017 conference we had the ambition by the end of 2019 to develop individual health records for the 50 million fully benefited members that we serve. We would use the Rally chassis which as indicated now has 20 million registered users to help provide individuals in a way which they could comprehend a tool, if you will, not only outlining their individual health record but also giving them next best action detail. That\u2019s what I mean by when I say it\u2019s deeply personalized, it\u2019s organized around them not based upon generic criteria. It also assess to what extent that they\u2019ve in and how they\u2019ve been served by the health system broadly and whether or not there\u2019s been any gaps in care that have been left behind. Our visions are also to take that to care providers to provide them with similar information but in a format that looks a little bit more like their EHR. And again, would include next best action as well. And so that would be provided to the physician and the workflow of the physician\u2019s office. And you might imagine what that could ultimately lead to in terms of continuing to develop a transaction flow between the physician and us and the consumer and us as us of being the custodian to try to drive better health outcomes for people but also ensure that the highest level of quality is adhered to quality defined by evidence-based practices and then also containing costs and eventually to incent the health system around responding to those deeply personal circumstances and situations. So we believe it to be pretty transformative across our business. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ll update you again here this coming November at our Investor conference and we look forward to doing so. Thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nPeter Costa: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just looking at your performance, it\u2019s really quite strong in a number of areas and it makes you wonder when you look at the not-for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, their performance seems to have improved as well. And one of the few places where you have some weakness is where they are the biggest competitors and that\u2019s in terms of the national account business. Do you think that\u2019s a sign that the health insurance cycle is starting to turn over at this point or is the health insurance cycle dead at this point?\nDavid Wichmann: I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be willing to make any projections on the cycle overall. All I can say is that our business in a very multidimensional way both on healthcare benefits and services is seeking to compete on multiple fronts really driving or accessing the strength of the organization around its ability to take information and apply technology and then in local markets organize clinical delivery systems to drive better outcomes, lower total cost to care and greater consumer satisfaction. You see that measured pretty consistently across the board of our organization. My only regret sometimes is whether or not we can do that faster and to have an even greater impact and that is what our deep intention is. I do think that our momentum around our competitiveness continues to accelerate and as a result I think you continue to see the broad-based results that are indicated in this release and also in the ambitions that we have for 2019 and beyond. It takes a lot of thought to make a commitment around a 13% to 16% long-term growth rate and to step out in 2019 the way that we have. But we\u2019re highly confident. This is a highly engaged management team. They are confident in their abilities to deliver those kinds of results consistently and our aim is to do so both to serve society as well as each and every one of our shareholders. So thank you for the question. We\u2019ll take one more question and then we\u2019ll be done.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take that question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nAna Gupte: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Wanted to follow up on your commentary about 2019 then pivoting to growth in self-funded in 2020 and any thoughts on the recent news flow about employers going direct to providers, doing their own member engagements and so on and is there anything you\u2019re doing to improve NPS scores there and what\u2019s driving the possible growth in 2020?\nDavid Wichmann: Ana, that\u2019s a good question. Our NPS scores with large employers are very strong and they continue to advance nicely year-over-year as well. As it relates to specific arrangements that employers may want to pursue an individual markets, we of course enable that. We\u2019re not bias by any particular format. They\u2019re our customers. We aim to serve their needs and so we do assist in enabling that as well as a number of other features that make exist in their benefit design and service composition. So we\u2019re an adaptable company. Our goal is to serve, serve people, serve consumers and also serve health systems broadly and I think that shows up in some of the most prolific ways in the larger employer market. Thank you for your question. If I can, then I will close. And some of the comments today UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare are driven by a single mission that we are actively and persistently engaged in helping to transform healthcare to make higher quality care accessible to more people, more simply and affordably in the U.S. and worldwide. We expect to continue to build on this year\u2019s strong momentum through the end of 2018 into 2019 and well beyond. But we never take our forward advance for granted. Everyday people of this enterprise are committed to serving individuals and local communities, one person, one system at a time with true compassion, high quality and innovative performance. We look forward to sharing much more with you during our annual investor conference on November 27. Thank you for joining us this morning. This concludes our call.\nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter report. We are encouraged by how our businesses are advancing in service to customers, consumers, physicians and across the health care system at large. Encouraged, but far from satisfied. Continuous innovation and improvement in the health care experience are critical to fulfilling our mission, helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Consistency in high-quality care, consumer experience and value build trust and loyalty. These drive retention and growth and position us to deliver strong and reliable financial results in 2019, 2020, and beyond. First half 2018 performance illustrates strong execution on this path. Compared to last year\u2019s first half, revenues of $111.3 billion, increased 12.7% or $12.5 billion. Adjusted cash flows from operations grew to $7.2 billion and adjusted net earnings grew 28.2% to $6.19 per share. For the full-year, our outlook for adjusted net earnings per share is increasing to a new range of $12.50 to $12.75 per share. And we expect cash flows from operations for 2018 to approach $15.5 billion, which is the upper end of our previous guidance. Importantly, our enterprise-wide Net Promoter Score is tracking to advance meaningfully again in 2018, after increasing 6 points in 2017. Our NPS is particularly strong or strongly improving across our government program customers and consumers, within our care delivery businesses, with network physicians and their practice managers, and with customers and consumers at UnitedHealthcare Global and the pharmacy business at OptumRx. NPS across the employer health benefits base remains solid, with upside opportunities to distinguish our performance among commercial market consumers. We believe emerging innovations around a next generation of digitally enabled, highly personalized services combined with more evolved consumer-centric benefit offerings will further advance our NPS performance. Quality continues to be strong and rising. Approximately 80% of our Medicare Advantage seniors will be served by 4-star rated plans in 2019, and we are looking to improve on that strong base in 2020. For commercial benefits, we expect more than 40 local market health plans will be rated in the top HEDIS categories in 2018, up from just 10 two years ago. And we continue to help create a better future for health care through Venture investments; building new businesses organically; ongoing investments in innovation throughout our enterprise; and, open source innovation through partnerships and strategic acquisitions of businesses and capabilities. We look forward to sharing some of these and other innovations and developments with you at our annual investor conference. As you know, we apply core competencies in clinical expertise, technology and data analytics to serve people in differentiated ways across our operating platforms, focusing on our five, long-term growth pillars. Transforming pharmacy care services is just one of those pillars. Applying our core competencies in the pharmacy arena yields a better service experience, transparency, simplicity, lower costs, higher value and growth, and we do so engaging proactively with customers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers across the industry. UnitedHealth Group now has more than five years\u2019 experience synchronizing medical care and pharmacy care for patients. Over those five years, we have continually applied learnings to refine our approach, while hardening, scaling and expanding our services. Results in market share and NPS gains suggest we are the clear market leader in capability, experience and value. We deliver integrated pharmacy care services to employers and health plans on both a carve-in and a carve-out basis. Health plans and employers continue to award OptumRx new business, while existing customers are retained at a high 90s percentage rate, year-after-year. Here\u2019s how this integration of pharmacy and medical care actually works. Optum\u2019s analytics engine processes administrative, demographic, clinical, lab, pharmacy and behavioral data to produce specific next best action information at the individual consumer level and identify the highest value actions an individual is most likely to take. That likelihood is a critical element because an action not taken produces no value. We then deliver the insight to patients, consumers, and physicians on a multi-channel basis. Perhaps they need help adhering to a medication regimen, or digital coaching to better manage a chronic condition, or they would benefit from our digital weight loss and diabetes prevention program. This year our customer advocates will help people, in real time, schedule hundreds of thousands of doctors\u2019 appointments to close specific gaps in care. Together, these services are helping client\u2019s advance quality, lower costs and improve consumer satisfaction. This integrated approach improves pharmacy adherence by 12%, while helping reduce hospital admissions and ER use by 6%. Our digital PreCheck MyScript service offers clarity, transparency and simplicity to the prescribing physician through their electronic medical record, while helping patients at the point of care. Already today, PreCheck MyScript is integrated into the practice flow of physicians who treat as many as 5 million OptumRx consumers over the next year, and we will grow that figure aggressively over the course of the next 18 months. These people will have a simpler experience at the pharmacy counter, as a direct result of the real-time pre-authorization capacities and the formulary cost and coverage information delivered to their physician by PreCheck MyScript. OptumRx continues to emphasize timely, convenient prescription delivery for consumers. Our specialty pharmacies have long used local hubs to provide same day and next day delivery, with clinical support and counseling provided by pharmacists via modern telemedicine. We provide infusion services, delivering specialty pharmaceuticals to patients in their homes over 350,000 times annually, and we have begun to apply these services more broadly through our OptumCare sites. Patients using maintenance medicines receive refills in advance of their refill dates through our home delivery services, providing value and convenience for these prescription needs. Finally, we are improving real consumer value, as a leader in offering transparent, point of sale discounts to consumers at the pharmacy counter. These meaningful discounts will be embedded in the basic benefit design for more than 7 million UnitedHealthcare insured consumers. We are the only party incented to reduce both the net cost of drugs for people and the total medical cost for customers, giving us a unique value role in the pharmacy supply chain. All of these capabilities appropriately manage pharmacy and medical cost trends, ensure the highest levels of patient safety, simplify the consumer\u2019s experience and improve value. Innovation, quality, service and performance across all five growth pillars will be critical to helping us fulfill our mission and doing our part to help the markets we serve advance care access while reining in growth in health care spending. Now, let me now turn it to Andrew Witty for an update on our Optum business. Andrew, welcome to UnitedHealth Group.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Dave. I\u2019ll start today by expressing my admiration and appreciation toward all those whose work has created the extraordinary Optum platform, which is frankly unlike any other health care business in the world. As a member of the UnitedHealth Group Board of Directors, I had the opportunity to get to know the company and its people. And now, as Optum\u2019s CEO, I am further impressed with the capabilities and talent we have at every level of this company and the breadth of opportunity for Optum to serve and grow in pursuit of its mission. Optum is vibrant and performing well. This young company will continue the nimble, market-responsive approach it has embraced since its inception, enabling Optum to serve more people, in more ways, and producing consistent, strong growth in revenues and earnings. In the second quarter 2018, OptumHealth increased the number of people it serves by 7% to 92 million, and revenue per person grew 12% over last year, as OptumCare grows and diversifies its businesses. OptumInsight\u2019s backlog grew nearly 15% year-over-year, on the strength of its technology, data analytics, business process and advisory services. And OptumRx again filled over 3% more adjusted prescriptions, as it continued to expand its market share. Overall, Optum second quarter revenues grew by more than $2 billion over last year, growth of about 9% to nearly $25 billion. Optum\u2019s earnings from operations rose 21.5%, driven by strong revenue growth and 80 basis points of margin expansion, due to both operating advances and solid, fundamental expense disciplines. Importantly, all three Optum segments expanded margins and grew operating earnings strongly. Now, looking ahead, the differentiated value we deliver to customers positions us to sustain growth into 2019 and beyond. Digital health is a UnitedHealth Group growth pillar, like pharmacy care services. Rally, part of Optum, has emerged as a market-leading comprehensive consumer digital health platform, fully implemented and operating at scale, with multi-payer capabilities. Rally is our digital front door for the consumer. Rally helps people easily select the best health benefits plans for their families, assess their health, pursue wellness and, when care is needed, engage effectively with the health care system. Rally has now surpassed $1 billion in cumulative incentives paid to consumers, standing apart in an early stage digital health marketplace. Consumers earned these incentives for taking real actions to improve their health, like receiving biometric screenings, working to stop smoking, or selecting a primary care physician, to just name three of many. By moving to digital coaching from legacy telephonic models, Rally triples the number of individuals engaging in our programs, while creating much higher consumer engagement intensity and loyalty. As a result, our customers are avoiding millions of dollars in downstream medical costs. Already one-third of our wellness coaching customers have moved to this new approach and more than 90% of their coaching engagements are digital, compared to an entirely analog experience only one year ago. OptumInsight continues to grow steadily, working actively with payer customers, large and small, supporting their efforts to maintain and improve clinical quality, administrative accuracy and payment integrity. Our artificial intelligence capabilities in areas like natural language processing for clinical information are embedded in our product sets and have proven valuable to both payers and care providers. Today, care providers who deliver care to nearly one-third of all Americans use Optum Performance Analytics, deepening and enriching the clinical data sets we use to improve performance of health care systems and the health of people. At OptumCare, we are creating the structure to advance more modern and locally effective clinical and administrative models, for the benefit of physicians, patients and customers. OptumCare actively advances the practice of evidence-based medicine and meaningfully improves consistency in care quality, while sustaining NPS scores in the range of 80 and offering more convenient sites of service for applicable procedures and examinations at more than 500 community locations nationally. Savings are more than 50% compared to less effective sites of care. This business is early in its growth curve, and, like digital health, we see it is another important long-term growth pillar for the enterprise. Finally, as you heard Dave say, the value being delivered in pharmacy care services is translating into higher NPS and continued client retention rates in the high 90s at OptumRx, and new wins, including three new health plans for 2019. We are already hard at work with prospects for 2020, even as we further strengthen capabilities for 2019. In sum, our businesses are growing and performing well today and preparing for next year, and we believe our investments in people, technologies and processes position us to grow for years to come. I am energized by the potential Optum has to make a meaningful difference in health care. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO.\nSteve Nelson: Thank you, Andrew, and welcome. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 2.2 million more people over the past 12 months. All-in, our revenues advanced more than $5 billion over last year to nearly $46 billion in the quarter, growing at a 12% pace, with Medicare & Retirement revenues growing nearly 13% and Community & State by more than 17%. Our commercial business continues to serve nearly 27 million people, with steady growth of 50,000 people in risk-based offerings this quarter, while the public and senior sector grew to serve 60,000 more people. We also experienced minor attrition in our fee-based products in the second quarter, similar to the second quarter of last year. The pricing we are receiving for risk-based products remains consistent with our expectations, and commercial medical cost trends remain steady, also in-line with expectations. And, we\u2019re performing well on managing administrative costs across UnitedHealthcare. In total, our second quarter earnings from operations of $2.4 billion grew 7% over second quarter last year. Looking forward, we are progressing well on two more enterprise growth pillars; consumer-centric benefits, and global. As we improve our total cost of care position and simplify the consumer experience. In consumer-centric benefits, we continue to align our approaches with value-based care delivery, supported by modern digital resources and data-empowered human and digital advocates, who help people navigate the system and achieve their health and care objectives. This modern, integrated approach increasingly enables greater personalization, better information flow and improved consumer experience and value, as measured by NPS. For example, in our Medicare products, value-based care is driving 5% increases in key screenings, a 13% lower rate of emergency room use and a 3% increase in the number of seniors with regular doctor visits. All of which ultimately impact cost, satisfaction, consumer retention and growth for our business. It\u2019s all about helping people at the moment they need it, and then making it as simple as possible for them to make the best decisions to improve the effectiveness and quality of their care, affordability and overall satisfaction. These themes hold true, whether the person making that decision is a patient with a medical issue, a healthy consumer focused on prevention, a physician treating a patient, or a business executive understanding value drivers in their health benefit offerings. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to see strong growth in serving those with higher acuity needs, like seniors, dual special needs, long-term support services and the chronically ill. UnitedHealthcare Global just completed the first full-quarter with Banmedica, which is growing and performing well, serving the people of Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Strong year-over-year improvements in business performance were made in Brazil, as focused efforts over the past half-decade have strengthened Brazilian clinical integration and business alignment. These efforts have been instrumental in improving earnings in that region and will continue to gain momentum going forward. Amil\u2019s recent recognition as the most innovative health insurance company in Brazil was informed by advances in technology, consumer experience and product design, and investments in primary care delivery and new models for paying for care. Our young South American business is well positioned, with strong assets, a stabilizing business environment and a long runway for growth. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Steve. The well-balanced quarter we reported this morning includes consolidated revenues growing 12% over last year to more than $56 billion. Our earnings from operations exceeded $4.2 billion, growing nearly 13%, on steady operating margins. Adjusted earnings increased 28% to $3.14 per share, and our cash flow from operations grew to $4 billion.  Turning to details, we continue to expect our 2018 medical care ratio to run in the range of 81.5% plus or minus 50 basis points, with commercial trend well within our range of expectations of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points. In the quarter, our consolidated care ratio of 81.9% reflects the impact of the health insurance tax, offset by changes in business mix and reserve development, both compared to last year. This quarter\u2019s favorable development was principally due to favorable cost true-ups from the first quarter 2018 business. Our second quarter operating cost ratio of 15% increased only 40 basis points over last year, despite including about 1 percentage point cost increase from the return of the health insurance tax and higher investments in innovation and business development. We offset that pressure with strong revenue growth in lower operating cost ratio businesses like Medicare and Medicaid and operating expense discipline across the board. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to maintain distinctive strength and flexibility. Return on equity for the second quarter exceeded 24%, and our debt to total capital ratio was 40.8% at June 30. In June, the board of directors raised our shareholder dividend by 20% to an annual rate of $3.60 per share, and we continue to deploy capital to further diversify our company through focused merger and acquisition activities and for our longstanding share repurchase program. We are optimistic as we look ahead to the second half of 2018 and into 2019, and strive for continued performance improvement, while taking a realistic and prudent view of the future. As Dave mentioned, we now expect 2018 cash flows from operations to approach $15.5 billion, and adjusted earnings in the range of $12.50 to $12.75 per share, growth of 24% to nearly 27%.\nDavid Wichmann : Thank you, John. We think about the numbers shared with you today as the result of serving millions of people, one person at a time, one health system at a time. We continue to advance value, simplicity, affordability and quality. Doing so in differentiated ways increases our value and sustains our growth. Growth provides even more opportunities to fulfill our mission and deliver long-term performance for the people we serve and our shareholders. As we pass the midpoint of this year, we begin to shift focus to the year ahead when we expect our enterprise to continue to innovate, grow and perform strongly for society and for our investors. We expect to grow revenues, earnings and cash flows broadly across the expanse of our uniquely diversified and increasingly global health care portfolio. We won\u2019t get into specifics now, but at this distance we see more tailwinds than headwinds. As was the case heading into 2018, the tailwinds in our businesses are largely generated internally, coming from strong and diversified growth across our five distinct pillars, all aimed at achieving our longstanding mission. To achieve this growth, our businesses will continue to make deeper investments in quality improvements, technology deployment, delivery system optimization, consumer-centric financing mechanisms and other innovations to improve the value individuals receive from the health system. These investments will also serve to lower our cost structures, improve NPS and enable sustained growth and differentiated value for years to come. As to headwinds, we expect the policy debates surrounding coverage expansions and health care costs to continue into next year. Additionally, the return of the health insurance tax in 2020 will cause higher premiums and lower coverage levels for people, and we will be advocating on behalf of our customers and consumers for a delay or outright repeal of this tax. As solid as our performance may seem, we are not satisfied, given our organization\u2019s capabilities and capacities to serve. Despite strong top-line growth and results, we are not performing at, nor consistently growing to, our full potential. This has, and will continue to be, an area of intense focus for our business leaders.  Perhaps even more critical from my perspective, we must work enterprise-wide to improve our speed and agility, so the pace of innovation and change better reflect our restless drive to deliver even more value to those we serve and unleash the full transformative impact of this enterprise. We will provide some initial direction on 2019 in our third quarter earnings call, followed by a full review at our annual Investor Conference on Tuesday, November 27. We hope you can join us there. Now we will open the call for your questions. One question per caller please so we can get to as many as people as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. My questions are on reserve development. Given the relative lack of prior and intra-year development in the quarter, I was hoping you could give us some increased color on cost trend and reserve development across the commercial Medicaid and Medicare segments. And then just to make sure we understand prior year development trends overall can you tell us what percentage of claims if any you have you set each quarter for adverse deviation to your reserves, I think most companies talk about mid-single digits, but just wanted to confirm yours. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, there is Jeff Putnam.\nJeff Putnam: Good morning. Thanks for your question Justin. Starting with development, we maintain our reserving process as you know that\u2019s tightly controlled and consistent over time, and we're very comfortable with our reserve position at the end of the quarter and really pleased with the overall accuracy of our reserve-in over time. When you look at our year-to-date development because second quarter was fairly modest, but when you look year-to-date as a percentage of our medical, prior year medical experience it is right in-line where we are historically. As that works into trends, we are always very respectful of trends, but as we stand right now we\u2019ve not seen anything to date that would inform or change our view on commercial medical trends for the year by cost category or in total, and we don't get into details on trends in Medicare and Medicaid businesses, but I could offer a couple of comments. Medicare trends generally stable with the last year and we are seeing some elevated consumption over time, similar to last year related to the market leading growth that we\u2019ve had and Medicaid trends also really need to be looked at state-by-state as always there are some areas with increased trend and then we are working to manage those down, but nothing really notable to call out on those.\nJustin Lake: The Medicare trend you mentioned, can you just expand on that like what would drive that in terms of your market leading growth? I apologize.\nJeff Putnam: Maybe, I could ask Brian Thompson to speak to that.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Hi, Justin. Brian Thompson here. Again, we're really not seeing any trend of the emergence in 2018, I want to make that clear. What we're seeing is very consistent with what we saw in 2017. I think the point is, given our market leading growth, we do prepare for and have seen a utilization uptick as we grow meaningfully compared to the rest of the market. We see that both in the form of new enrollees, as well as our improved retention and are holding onto folks later in life. So again, what we're seeing in 2018 looks a lot like what we saw in 2017 and 2016 that\u2019s been the 4Q and now for strong market share gains and provides a very credible good baseline for us as we look forward to 2019.\nJustin Lake: Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSarah James: Thank you. My question is on the 2019 commercial environment. On the last call, you had mentioned the national account RFP pipeline is larger than normal. Is that \u2026\nDavid Wichmann: Sarah, we are having a hard time hearing you, so can you \u2013 you may be on a headset or something, can you\u2026\nSarah James: Sorry, is that better?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, it is, thank you.\nSarah James: So, my question is on the 2019 commercial pricing, on the last call you mentioned that the national account RFP pipeline was larger than normal, there have been some concerns as I believe which I think pricing, so, could you walk us through how you are seeing national account small and middle market develop?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. I think the question relates to national accounts pipeline and development team.\nDan Schumacher: Sure, thanks Sarah good morning. So, on the national accounts front, as we continue to progress through the selling season, I think I shared last quarter and would likewise amplify this quarter is that it is really a theme around incumbency that continues to be as we progress to the selling season. At this point, I would tell you that we\u2019ve had some nice new client wins, as well as expansions in existing clients, but we\u2019ve also had some client leave us as well, and obviously there is still more to be resolved in the selling season. We are doing well again to convert retirees to group Medicare offerings and likewise we continue to do very well in the middle market segment as we work through the year. So, that is sort of the self-funded national account profile. I think you also were asking a bit about the pricing environment and as it relates to commercial risk-based offerings. And from our perspective, we are happy to see as we had told you last quarter, we would expect to return to growth in the commercial risk-based group offerings as we progress through the year. We did that in the second quarter and had nice contributions across all market segments from individuals, small groups through to middle market as well. So, as we look at that environment it is competitive, it has been competitive. We always have pockets of competition that we\u2019re responding to, but we find ourselves well positioned and well served by our broad footprint both geographically, as well as by market segment and funding status. As we talked about in this form for some time, we\u2019ve done well to expand our product portfolio really along that value and price continuum and increasingly aligned that to get providers that are high performing. So, hopefully that gave you some color on what is happening both in the self-funded and the fully insured segments in the commercial markets.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Sarah. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to flip over to Optum, the kind of two-part are here, so the first part, OptumInsight margin has performed very well year-to-date, wondered if you could talk about either pricing or mix of business drivers of that? And then secondly and more broadly as Andrew talked about Rally and the uptake of different technologies, how do you think about broadening the uptake or the adoption rate of your technologies in an environment where we might see competition directly from a technology company?\nDavid Wichmann: Okay. We will take both those questions. Tim you want to take the first one?\nTim Wicks: Sure. Happy to do that. Dave thank you very much for the question. So, on OptumInsight, as we think about the quarter and we think about the margin growth it really is two items. One, you referenced pricing and mix and there is a significant amount of mix opportunity that is occurring in terms of growth of business around the risk and quality businesses, as well as payment integrity, and then the second area that is also important and continues to be important, you heard us talk a significant amount in 2017 about the discipline that we drove financial discipline and overall cost management, and that\u2019s really coming through the business. Frankly, all across Optum, but specifically an OptumInsight in the quarter as well.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. And then if I can I will just make a few remarks on Rally as well. Thank you for the question. Rally as you can tell in the script is something that we're very proud of having developed over the course of last four years. Obviously, there was a lot of work that went into in advance of our alignment with them, but they\u2019ve done a very nice job of taking a single product company and making it multidimensional along the lines that Andrew has described. So, we are seeing probably the very fast uptake and in fact accelerating uptake of that business as we expand our offerings to respond to greater levels of consumer need. So as an example, when we gave Rally the responsibility for our premium designation program, which is effectively the way in which consumers search for and find a physician and/or other care services we gave that responsibility we also started to appeal to a broader group of consumers, which dramatically increase the registration rate across that platform now sitting at I believe somewhere around 18 million people are registered with Rally today.  So, we believe that the expansion of the value that is offered on the Rally chassis is the single best way to get there and that really requires that we continue to provide a significant value to consumers both in terms of cost containment, but also in terms of the improved health that they each received. So, we\u2019re continuing to expand and diversify that offering keeping it simple for people and we look forward to the developments that we will see with the individual health record and how that drives next best action and to the consumers that we serve and expect to see increased utilization as a result as well.\nDave Windley: Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, David. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nPeter Costa: Good morning. Thank you. My first question is regarding Optum. Andrew welcome aboard in your first quarter in the hot seat, and I kind of want to understand what you expect to be different about growing Optum going forward under you relative to how it\u2019s grown in the past? And then if you could in the quarter itself the growth in revenues at Optum slowed down from the first quarter, can you spike out how much of that was related to M&A?\nAndrew Witty: Sure. Peter thanks very much for the question. I\u2019ll ask Tim in a second to address your second part of the question, but in terms of the first, obviously very early days for me here at Optum, I them terrific foundations have been laid over the last seven or eight years in terms of the asset base of this company has is rarely, I think unparallel in terms of the portfolio of assets that we have. As we look forward, I think the opportunity is going to be very much centered around how we start to drive the gearing between all of these assets to really bring to life the full potential of this portfolio. And I think what we see, a very high level is significant at direct local interface as care provider and touch points with patients and consumers. So, a business with a real face backed up with an extraordinary evolving digital capability, which then allows us to drive high frequency contact really all underpinned by tremendous commitment to care and delivering quality of care, commitment to bringing down total cost of care and ensuring all of that is done in an extraordinary high-quality way. So, I think all of those tenants of the business, which have got us thus far are going to be absolutely the characteristics going forward. What I\u2019m focusing on now of course is really making sure I understand all of the various parts of this business, working with the team to figure out the next steps, but it is going to, I think be characterized very much in the way I just described. Maybe, I could pass to Tim to answer the more specific question on the quarter.\nTim Wicks: Sure. Peter, thank you for the question. First, what I would say is, as we look at the growth rate of revenue at Optum both year-over-year and sequentially it is in-line with our plans in both of those ways of looking at it. The revenues of 24.7 billion were up 9% or up 2.1 billion, compared to a year ago with both OptumHealth and OptumInsight posting double-digit growth rates and with OptumRx posting a 7% growth rate year-over-year.  In each of those businesses, organic growth was very strong, both in OptumHealth, in terms of care delivery with market expansion, as well as OptumServe volume growth and then behavioral health and then in OptumInsight, strong growth with the addition of the advisory board, but also pretty significant volume growth in terms of our risk and quality business and then also volume growth and payment integrity. Also, when I mentioned OptumRx earlier in the overall revenue growth there, I think it is important to understand that that\u2019s driven by new sales growth in terms of new clients that have come on, as well as very strong expansion in terms of specialty as well. So, really solid growth across the businesses and in-line with our expectations.\nPeter Costa: I was hoping you would spike out quantitatively exactly what the growth was from M&A this quarter versus the growth last quarter.\nTim Wicks: We don't spike that out specifically Peter, but I would tell you it\u2019s not an appreciable difference.\nPeter Costa: Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, thank you Peter. Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow up on sort of the decline in ASO, coupled with another strong quarter of growth in the group risk business. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing out there, has that sort of decades long shift ASO stalled or slowed or are you seeing greater demand for group risk products now and if so, why do you think that is? And just in this context, if you could comment on Nexus ACO, I'd be really curious to hear what\u2019s happening there? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Sure, thanks Steve. This is Dan Schumacher. You had a few things tucked in there, but first just on the quarter and the decline with regard to self-funded enrolment. In reality, there is, it is just sort of the normal seasonal pattern, particularly in our international accounts and quarter-based attrition. So, if you look at that outcome it compares into the average of the last 5 or 10 years it is very much in keeping with that.  So, really just the normal seasonal pattern we see on the ASO front. I think you had asked about is there an acceleration or a change in the trend in the migration from fully integrated to self-funded. That continues to be a recurring theme I would say, it's sort of add a comparable pace to what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years.  So, I wouldn't spike out any acceleration or deceleration in that. We don't believe on the fully insured side to see greater take-up rights, what we\u2019re doing there is we are actually taking market share, and I think that large contributor to that is really the work that we\u2019ve done as I had mentioned before around expanding our product portfolio around that value of continuum and then making sure importantly we pair it with really high performing care delivery partners both OptumCare, as well as externally, and then improving as we have talked about the consumer experience and making it simple and personal for them. You had asked I think also about Nexus ACO. We continue to build that product and are excited for the prospects and just as a reminder for those on the phone that Nexus ACO offering is really a national accountable care offering. So, we string together our best solutions locally onto a national solution. Today we've got about 75,000 enrollees on that. We\u2019ll double that as we turn into the year and we look to double that again by the time we get to the end of 2019. Thanks Steve.\nDavid Wichmann: So, really Steve what you\u2019ve hit on is this category of growth for us, pillar of growth around consumer centric benefits, and Nexus ACO would be one example, but if you look to the distinguished group insured growth over the course of the last three years or so, and why we are bullish on growth going forward it\u2019s really because of these new designs that were progressively putting in the marketplace and may be tied to the question to before that. Our ability than to use digital assets and other ways to engage consumer around lifestyle behavior modifications creates a great attraction to these products as well. Thank you for your question. Next question please.\nOperator: Thanks. We will go next to Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Baker: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could outline some of your promising venture investments in-light of your drive to reshape the future health care.\nDavid Wichmann: We\u2019ll start with David Wichmann.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes sure. So, Optum Ventures they generally invest in visual health companies that use data and analytics to improve consumers access to help the healthcare services and health care across the board. Also, Ventures really invest in things that make the health care system more reliable and easier to navigate. The Ventures investments are focused on I would say four main areas, health analytics, digital on-demand, consumer focused health, and healthcare system management. I would also say and conclude that there is lot of synergies between Optum and Optum Ventures, Optum providing a good scalable platform to test Optum Ventures and Optum Ventures is being able to sort of give us some shots in the arm with respect toward Digital agenda.\nMichael Baker: Thanks [indiscernible].\nDavid Wichmann: I would just add a little bit to that if I can. We also build businesses organically as well inside our company and maybe just comment on a couple. One would be a business [indiscernible] we are advancing new platforms for dialysis really trying to promote home-based dialysis and use, as well as trying to drive greater value to consumers in that whole category if you will. And then at this time, I would also mention when we announced this in the last couple of weeks where we created a company called, along with our venture partner alumni, created a company called [indiscernible], which is an on-demand healthcare insurance platform, which I would characterize as being pretty revolutionary in terms of the potential that holds to fit a particular market segment in the group insured marketplace, as well as self-funded market as well. So, those are a couple of additional examples. These are the things that we hope to profile for you to a greater extent when we get together in November. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I want to ask you about the guidance because I struggled a little bit with the guidance that\u2019s happened so far year-to-date because Q1 you raised guidance by less than a beat in Q2, you basically raised guidance with the beat, even though announcing a few pretty big deals during the year, Banmedica, Sound, a few other things that are probably at least a third of what the full guidance range has been. So, I wanted to see if you could kind of rectify why, you know the guidance hasn't been raised by more given the tailwinds from M&A and then given a fairly pretty solid trend so far in the first half of the year? Is there anything you would highlight as you know one-time in the first half or a headwind coming in the second half?\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks Kevin. I think we\u2019ve actually raised expectations pretty strongly over the course of this year. So, twice by total of about $0.175 [ph] at the midpoint and that\u2019s despite some pretty substantive flu pressure and a new HIPAA effect that we\u2019ve identified in the first quarter of around $0.22 or so. So, the way we look at it at least from my vantage point we\u2019ve raised it by about $0.40 or so, so far this year. So, but I think importantly as we look to the balance of 2018 we\u2019re focused on growth, we\u2019re continuing to focus on cost containment and achieving the full potential this enterprise capacity is, and you could see that we are deeply investing in innovation to drive constructive measured change and improve healthcare economics in both North and South America. So, we are also focused on these five areas of growth advancing quality, driving MPS or measured by MPS I should say, and again continuing to invest and diversify our businesses so that we can achieve a long-term sustainable growth rate that we have outlined for you in the past of which we remain deeply committed to as well. We did buy Medicare in the first quarter that Medicare is interesting for us, right now it is in winter. So, not particularly accretive in the second and third quarter of the year, it happens to bare the same characteristics as the UnitedHealthcare Brazil businesses as well. So, we don't see a lot of material improvements in our results as it relates to that and they will start to see that closer to the fourth quarter or so. But part of what I laid out as well is that and maybe this is what you\u2019re suspecting is that the company has so much potential given its assets and just performing to its full potential is our ambition and that is what this team is aiming to achieve. So, we will continue to get after cost, we are going to continue to get after growth, and diversifying and growing our business and importantly investing in it for the long term. So, we can serve more people and so more health systems better. Thanks, good for your question. Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, good morning. I had a couple of questions or question on the PVM in particular, I was invested in understanding for margin in OptumRx, looks like margin was up for the quarter although cost of product was also up, so I was just interested in some of the drivers of that and then I guess related to the long-term view there, how are you looking at the online pharmacy strategy of United overall and with an entrant like Pillpack and Amazon, what's your view as far as adding them in network, partnering with them et cetera? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Great question Lance. Appreciate it. John Prince, do you want to take that?\nJohn Prince: Sure. Lance, John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. Thanks for the question. Maybe just talk about the margin in general. We are comfortable with our long-term outlook of 3% to 5%. I think when we see in different quarters, you see a variation with mix over time. The product is really driver of our specialty home-infusion and those really drive our business in terms of the product mix and so I think it will fluctuate over time, but ultimately, we're comfortable with our long-term outlook and also comfortable with how we\u2019re executing on the market from an overall perspective. In terms of online pharmacy, we work with various partners across the healthcare system. We have been very focused on our consumer experience in our home delivery, our specialty and our infusion business, that has been the key driver of our growth over the last year and a half. We have done exceptionally the job of improving our MPS in those areas. We have become hyper-local.  Those businesses where we are in the market and so if you look at our strategy, we retain home delivery specialty in fusion, wherein a 35 mark has been hyper-local we\u2019ve added six this year, we are going to add six more this year. We see the market relates pivoting to be in both same day and next day service. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in that, and I think we\u2019re flexible based on how consumer wants to work with us in terms of whether they want to be online digital in the market etcetera. And I think we\u2019ve got a good strategy to execute against that. Thanks for the question.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. So, I thought at this point maybe just to ask about the comment you made towards the end Dave in your prepared remarks where you talked about restless drive, I think the comment was not satisfied with the performance of few areas where we could better and then I think also maximizing performance consistently. I mean, you\u2019ve done 28% EPS growth in the first half, pretty good by most standards for this industry, what are the areas where you think you are still underperforming and what are you sort of referring to with those comments?\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question A.J. Appreciate it. I think we have highlighted some of those today. We didn't really talk about in terms of levels of disappointment, but I think it is fair to say that we are not particularly pleased with how we have done the large case ASO marketplace overall. If you look at our performance over the course of the past years and it is not reflective of the winning capabilities of this company, and so that is a good example of a place that I think we need to improve. Very satisfied with our MPS performance, but extremely anxious to get that moved up and at the same time manage the interchange of that with the evolutions that are required in order to respond to consumer demands. So, figuring that out is one of our challenges and I\u2019d say maybe another one is just the pace at which we are driving adoption of the use of technology and digital broadly and by most measures there is nothing wrong here. I don't want to leave you with that point-of-view, but by most measures with the company of that capacity that this one has, I just believe we should be able to move faster with greater speed and agility to respond to emerging market demand for these kinds of services. We are well up front with all of them, but my view is we need to get these into the hands of the consumers faster and make a bigger difference on how the effectiveness of health systems and the health of people. And so maybe just call, chuck it up a little bit to having maybe higher expectations than what we\u2019re currently achieving, largely because we have a good inside view of what the internal capacities are of this enterprise overall. So, expect this to step it up.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.\nDavid Wichmann: Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask on two specific growth opportunities in 2019, the first around Medicare Advantage. And now that you guys have submitted your bids, I'm just curious there's a thought around relatively generous reimbursement, especially relative to what we've seen over the last decade or so and how you think about the Medicare Advantage market overall and then United within that. And then the second area, just public exchanges, individual public exchanges, curious if you guys are getting more interested or I guess that would be any interested in potential expansions there and how you're thinking about that market over the next couple of years?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Josh. Brian Thompson will take your first question. A - Brian Thompson Thanks, Josh. Brian Thompson here. As I mentioned last quarter, certainly encouraged by the direction of the 2019 rate, it's up nearly three points versus last year and then you complement that with some policy changes around the framework that provides greater flexibility around how we can define benefits all good for seniors. As you mentioned, I do think that ushers in an opportunity in 2019 for an environment that will provide stronger coverages and innovations and benefit enhancements for the senior serve [ph]. So, should be great for MA. As I think about our position in it, we will approach 2019 with an expectation of continuing the momentum that we've demonstrated over the last four years with share gains in 2019 as well. \nDavid Wichmann: And as it relates to exchanges, maybe I'll just take that one. I think Josh as we've said in the past, first of all our decisions are made state by state and as you know we have a very modest presence overall. I want to kind of reaffirm that nothing has fundamentally changed since we made our decision several years back now, which has absolutely turned out to be the right one for us. And as always, we'll evaluate for future participation on a market-by-market basis. One thing you may read is, that there was some noise out there about us joining the Massachusetts Exchange. I just want you to know that that was largely due to our small group penetration having grown to a point where we were required to participate in that exchange. So, it wasn't necessarily a voluntary decision on our part. Thanks for the question. Next questions please.\nOperator: We will go next to Ralph Jacoby with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Jacoby: Thanks, good morning. Just want to go back to MLR, moved higher than we expected, obviously lots of moving parts. Can you maybe just talk about whether you've seen a bit of an uptick in maybe cost per claim or acuity? And it would be helpful to break out the 6% trend between what you're seeing in terms of utilization versus unit cost and then the last piece, just if you can give us a sense of how much then Medicare and seasonality there may be impacted MLR in the quarter? Thanks.\nTim Wicks: Thank you, Ralph. Quite a few questions inside that Ralph, but thanks for the questions. First on MLR, just to say that, that was right in-line with our expectations and as we noted earlier, there is - we're not changing our outlook for the full-year at all and the year-over-year change is an element that we described, the insurers' tax impact is favorable and then business mix and the less favorable development go on the other direction. As far as acuity, we would - overall acuity in aggregate is in-line with our expectations out there as well. What you'll see over time though as we work hard to keep moving lower acuity in each category to its appropriate place of service that what remains in each category will naturally have a little bit upward pressure on acuity inside those categories. No change in our view on unit cost versus utilization, still it's 4% primary driver being the unit cost and 2% of utilization. And then I think the last piece was Banmedica, I think Dave touched a little bit on that earlier from given the size of Banmedica against our total medical expense base, it's really not a material factor at this point.\nDavid Wichmann: So, you should conclude from this that the trends are very much in-line with our expectations for the year. Our teams are performing very well containing health care costs and they are pricing to a forward view of trends, very consistent with the actions that we've taken in the past. You should also take it as it relates to our last comment around international, that our international businesses in South America are performing very well, very nice growth year-over-year, offer strong baselines, good start for Banmedica as well. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Just a quick two-parter. Any specific comment on days claims payable being down just to touch and then the second point is, we've kind of tiptoed around to talking about trends and I've heard and appreciate all your comments, but I just wanted to specifically ask on hospital trend given the flow of profit hospitals saw such a marked acceleration of same-store revenue in the first quarter, it's with a little more visibility at this point is, if you have seen in fact just on the hospital piece, any pickup in that trend?\nTim Wicks: Gary, I think I'll take that last one first and that we really have it when things are really aligned and consistent with what our expectations were coming into the year, and as we move throughout the year as well. The first part of your question with respect to the days, Jeff, do you want to take that?\nJeff Alter: Sure. Just to start by, as we mentioned, we're comfortable with our level of reserves here as of June 30, and it's 48.3 days, that's well within our expected range that you've seen us historically, which is typically been 47 days to 49 days other than the period where we had the individual ACA effects that elevated it up to closer to 50. And it's down year-over-year about a day when you bring it out to the decimal point there and there's a couple of things contributing to that. One is, we continue to see \u2013 we've talked about this earlier, a little modest reduction in provider claim submission timing, and also there was a timing impact from when we released capitated payments that are directly linked to risk and value revenue receipts that just changed from third quarter to second quarter relative to last year.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Gary. Next question please. \nOperator: And we will go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question and good morning everybody. This is a little bit granular, but we are getting a few calls around the new expansion in 2018 of total knee replacement from just the in-patient to now the outpatient setting. So, I think at a high level, I mean there should be some cost savings around this, but there also could be an increase in utilization just because of the availability now in the lower cost setting. I'm just curious at high level what you're seeing around this phenomenon so far this year? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Maybe Andrew Hayek, who came to us from SCA can respond. \nAndrew Hayek: Thanks Steve for the question. I'll offer some general commentary. I do think the CMS policy announcement is consistent with our overall view that more surgery, including higher acuity surgery will shift to the outpatient setting and alter the surgery center setting, and that's based on improvements in technology and surgical technique and aesthetic technique and all of that improves the quality experience of cost to care. So, from an SCA standpoint, we have been seeing a continued growth in total joint replacement procedures in commercial space. We are beginning to see that happen with needs from a Medicare standpoint, in terms of physicians preparing to shift those cases. We know it\u2019s really good for the patient in terms of quality and experience, very high NPS, fantastic quality outcomes, and then substantial cost savings. We've been seeing that on a commercial basis for a number of years and working very collaboratively with even health plans and we think that will be a great benefit to Medicare over the coming years. And we expect them to continue to widen the range of procedures that are eligible for our patient. So, all the right thing to the patient and for the health care system.\nDavid Wichmann: Which is one of the reasons why we invested in SCA, which we viewed as the right ambulatory surgical platform properly positioned in the higher acuity surgeries that were offered in those settings, and to have great ambition for its ability to expand and need to meet some more people with higher quality and greater levels of consumer satisfaction. Just as a reminder, SCA operates in 91 NPS zone. So, very progressive and doing so while saving consumers about 50%. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nAna Gupte: Good. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. The question is on drug pricing reform and if you have any change in your plans or actions to aid the administration's agenda on overall spending specialty RX, transparency and out of pocket for seniors. You have the largest set of capabilities at scale with Medicare Advantage, bundled with Part D, the largest \u2013 big three integrated PBM and BFRX [ph], I was just curious? \nJohn Prince: Thanks Ana, it is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. In terms of overall drug pricing, we are very focused on lowering drug cost for consumers. And as you know Ana, our strategy is focused on where in that cost of drugs, decrease in total cost to healthcare and really creating a transformative consumer experience. And that is very aligned with what is happening in the broader market. So, in terms of what we're focused on, we're very focused on initiatives that bring down the list price of drugs, but more importantly, the net cost of drugs. So, a lot of things that we even focused on are providing out ideas around what we're doing exactly. So, as you know, in the second quarter beginning \u2013 in the late first quarter, we started drug-to-consumer pharmacy discounts at healthcare that impacts 7 million people, I think David talked about it in his script. That impacts people from all effective cost. We've been very focused on investments and please check my script. That now is being used by almost 100,000 physicians in the market that directly links into the electronic medical record that is helping in transparency, it gives the doctor an idea of what is on formulary, how does that cost, is there lower cost alternatives. We are very focused on value payments, we are heavily focused on \u2013 we got 15 of those in the market right now and continue to expand that. And lastly, we're very focused on our drug negotiations and encouraging our pharmaceutical partners to lower the list price. And so, we've been working with people as they come to market with products to have a lower list price and when people have done that, we've put them preferred on the formulary. So, it gives you a series of examples that we're very focused on reducing our cost, improving total cost to care and we've been doing very practical things in the market to make that a reality.\nAna Gupte: Thanks, John.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to next to David MacDonald with SunTrust. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacDonald: Good morning. Thank you. Just one quick question on Global. I was wondering if you guys could spend a minute on what you're trying to do at the local level to increase the penetration of private insurance and also what you're doing more at the national level to try and drive increased public private collaboration with these governments? Thanks. \nDavid Wichmann: Great. We'll have Molly Joseph, our Chief Executive of UnitedHealthcare Global respond. \nMolly Joseph : Sure. So, our focus is around our Latin America platform and there we really see a very strong demand for access to private healthcare and a limited supply of affordable private health care. And our core capabilities create tremendous value across affordability, access and outcomes for those that we serve. Our businesses in these markets are broad, they are diversified and they are scaled. And that is both from the health benefit perspective and from a medical delivery perspective. And we work to use these platforms in combination with our enterprise core capabilities, to advance healthcare modernization, make care more affordable and make it more effective for those that we serve. In doing that, we open up access to serve broader segments of the private healthcare market and over time, we earn trust to serve these markets more holistically by partnering with government. \nDavid Wichmann: I think one of the strongest examples of that is our public private partnership in our hospital in Portugal as an example, where we're leading on quality and provide a very cost-effective solution working with government to serve the needs of the people of Portugal. And Molly and her team has really done a nice job and particularly you saw on the script around innovation and bringing new innovations to the market. What you're starting to feel is the introduction of information analytics, use of digital capacities, increased product modernization and designs in countries that have historically not had a great deal of diversity of offering. So that helps to create demand for all folks and you have access to private health systems and serves the needs of multiple different price point expectations that those consumers have. So, we're very pleased with the work that they've done. Next question please. \nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: Thank you. If I could just \u2013 sorry this is on a very technical near-term data point, but maybe in response to the first question that you had in the Q&A session here on the reserving, I guess what I'm just trying to understand is, clearly there's a positive bias that was again this quarter to your reserve development. But is there a specific margin for adverse deviation, if that's the correct term I'm using that, that you target or is there some \u2013 or should we expect that zero is in your view the best result as we move ahead?\nDavid Wichmann: Jeff? \nJeff Alter: Thanks for question Matt. That's not something we disclose publicly, that said it is not zero. We do have a target and it's been very stable over the years built up by business for adverse deviation.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, and where that really shows itself is when you carry over from over a year. It doesn't really show up quarter-to-quarter, it shows up going from Q4 to Q1 and less dramatic when you get into Q2. Our development as indicated in the script, it really relates to Q1 this year and it's not all that different from the development that we experienced in Q2 2017, related to the first quarter of 2017 as well. Thank you, Matt. Next question please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMike Newshel: Thanks. I wanted to ask how much headwind from the health insurer fee moratorium you're expecting in the back half of the year from bigger commercial renewals. Dave, I think you mentioned a $0.22 impact earlier, is that right? And was any of that absorbed in the first half of the year?\nDavid Wichmann: The $0.22, I'm sorry to confuse you, it really related to the impact of flu combined with that. I think this specifically, the hit component was what $0.06, $0.07 something in that zone, if I recall correctly, Mike. \nMike Newshel: Got it. And then, most of that falling in the second half of the year, but small? \nDavid Wichmann: That's right. Yes. \nMike Newshel: Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. I believe that concludes the questions for the day. We accomplished one of our performance metrics and that was to make sure that we were able to answer all of your calls \u2013 all of your questions, excuse me. And so, I appreciate them, they were all very good. So, \u2013 but to sum up our report for the second quarter, the people of UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare executed well on our strategic path, improving quality, affordability and consumer satisfaction for the people we serve resulting in growth and reliable return for our shareholders. Revenue, cash flow, earnings and importantly, NPS scores continue to advance. While we recognize there is much more to be done to reach the full transformative potential of our enterprise, we are committed to help positively reshape healthcare, to be higher quality, more affordable simpler and of higher value to people. We are confident that we will continue the strong performance in the second half of this year in 2019, 2020 and for many years to come. Thank you again for joining us today. This concludes our call.\nOperator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation.

I will be your conference operator today. Welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 17, 2018, which may be accessed from the investors page of the company's website. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Results for this initial quarter of 2018 continued the performance trends of recent years, well balanced, strong top line revenue growth, solid medical cost performance, meaningful advances in NPS and effective capital deployment. First quarter revenues grew 13% to $55.2 billion. Adjusted cash flows from operations grew 60% to more than $3.2 billion, and adjusted net earnings grew 28% to $3.04 a share. We are raising our full year outlook for adjusted net earnings by $0.10 per share on the lower end of our range and $0.05 per share at the upper end to a new range of $12.40 to $12.65 per share, reflecting the strengthening of our businesses; competitively differentiated offerings; diversified medical market positions; and above all, the value we provide to those we serve. UnitedHealth Group constantly evolves but more so advancing these last 2 decades towards a more diversified, capable, modern and socially responsive health care company. Health care financing and savings, health information and technology, pharmacy and medical care delivery, population and consumer digital health and our many other health benefits and health services offerings are all elements of a broader strategic mission globally to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. Every one of our 285,000 team members works every day to make the highest-quality health care more affordable, accessible and responsive to the individual needs of the nearly 140 million people we now serve one person at a time. We look very different today than five years ago. For example, clinical and technology professionals are the first and third largest job categories across UnitedHealth Group. And we will look different again five years from now as we continue to evolve at an accelerated pace. I'll offer one example, within 10 years, we expect half of all Americans will be receiving their health care from physicians operating in highly evolved and coordinated value-based care designs because the outcomes clearly demonstrate properly constructed value-based care arrangements, improved quality and consumer satisfaction while reducing the costs of health care. This structural shift from fragmented fee-for-service medicine is the type of opportunity for which we are built. Specifically, UnitedHealthcare uses data analytics to understand and identify high-performing care delivery partners and then contracts for care under value-based arrangements with these care providers. More directly, OptumCare provides data-driven, highly coordinated, high-value ambulatory care for populations of patients for all payers, including UnitedHealthcare. And we use modern technology and information across the expanse of our enterprise to enable and improve health system performance to the benefit of all consumers and payers across the spectrum of health care. In all of these instances, we design products and services applying clinical knowledge-based resources to optimize health system performance to better serve individuals. There are many other examples of how we are employing these competencies enterprise-wide for the people we are privileged to serve, such as caring for the frail and vulnerable wherever they reside, delivering value and transparency in pharmacy care services or advancing new products and services through our integrated plan and care delivery operations in Brazil. And soon we will offer consumers highly advanced, simplified individual health records. These IHRs will help consumers to better understand and execute next-best health actions to improve individual health and the overall performance of health systems. This will represent the first intelligent, consumer-directed health information capacity in the markets we serve. And we hope, over time, it could help transform the way health information is used in the care process. We are collaborating across the health care sector to improve quality and value for people and seeking to take our performance for them to significantly higher levels as we march towards an NPS average score of 70 across the enterprise over the next five years. We believe UnitedHealth Group remains early in its evolution, with a long runway for growth. My colleagues will give you an update on our businesses and their progress towards this shared vision for the future of health care, starting with Optum's Chief Executive, Larry Renfro.\nLarry Renfro: Thank you, Dave. Optum begins this year serving more clients and more people in more ways through broader and deeper relationships and with a greater variety of products and services than ever before. Consumers served, first quarter adjusted scripts and revenue backlog are at all-time highs, driving up Optum's first quarter revenues 11% to $23.6 billion. Strong growth, together with excellent operating costs and productivity management, lifted the first quarter margin by 100 basis points over last year. Operating earnings grew 29% to almost $1.7 billion. Optum is helping meet consumers' needs for a simpler, more personalized health care system. Today, more than 35 million people can use Rally Care to evaluate and access best care. Rally Care delivers aided physician search, facility lookup and full price transparency directly to the consumer using highly relevant, individualized details of their own benefit plans, actual network contracts and actual deductible status. That means consumers can see what their personal out-of-pocket costs will be for a specific treatment at a specific facility performed by a specific doctor. It also provides sophisticated yet simple and distinctive information about quality, an individualized next-best action lists for better health and independent consumer reviews from other patients. People have conducted 16 million searches using Rally Care. 94% of the time, their hospital searches focused on a Tier 1 hospital, meaning higher quality and lower costs. And 36% of out-of-network provider searches have been redirected to higher-quality in-network care providers. Nearly 2.5 million people per week are using Rally Care. When a consumer selects a premium designated physician, they reduce their costs of health care by more than $300 per care episode. Last year, we saw over $100 million in medical costs saved for customers through Rally Care. Rally Engage rewards people for healthy choices and behaviors, and Rally users earned more than $200 million in incentives in just this past quarter. We will be introducing this offering to our Medicare Advantage customers in 2019. We are also driving price transparency for care providers and patients with our PreCheck MyScript offering. PreCheck MyScript integrates directly into the care provider's EMR workflow; and gives doctors realtime information about whether a drug is covered by the patient's plan, lower cost options and what the patient will pay out of pocket. PreCheck MyScript is one element in our synchronized approach to pharmacy care where we reach consumers through as many touch points as possible to improve their health outcomes and impact the total cost of care. Since introducing PreCheck MyScript last year, we have already helped 500,000 patients. And over 20% of the time, the consumer and their physician are switching to a lower-cost prescription when presented alternatives. This advanced technology improves the physician, patient and pharmacy experience. It's simple to use, saves money for consumers and plan sponsors and leads to better pharmacy adherence and health. Initiatives like these give you an idea of why we are so enthusiastic about what is still to come from Optum, all in support of our mission addressing the health needs of people and improving health systems broadly. We are building on what is already an unmatched foundation for innovation and growth. For hospitals and care delivery organizations, we have grown our full-service revenue management capability into a $2 billion business, with the strongest capabilities in the marketplace. With the recent deepening of our advisory business, we expect to add significantly more value for our care delivery customers. Today, we help over 3 million account holders better manage their health care spending, with more than $9 billion in dedicated health care funds now managed through Optum Bank, up from $1 billion in the first quarter of 2010. Through Optum Labs, our research forum founded in 2013, we convene leading researchers to deliver the actionable research through cutting-edge programs that drive new interventions. Last year, Optum Labs addressed the opioid epidemic, developing a performance framework targeting four aspects of the crisis, prevention, pain management, treatment of opioid use disorder and the impact of opioids on maternal health. This framework is being used to apply fresh approaches to helping those combating this major health epidemic in the U.S. By 2015, we had expanded our pharmacy benefit management business; and transformed it into a pharmacy care services business focused on the application of advanced technology, synchronization of medical and pharmacy benefits and transparency, alongside improved processing flexibility, service and procurement expertise. This innovative approach produces distinctive savings averaging up to $1,500 per member per year and was recognized by the health care transformation alliance and other marquee customers, driving OptumRx to a market-leading growth rate on a multiyear basis. OptumCare has grown from a single medical practice serving 350,000 people and 1 payer to an emerging national ambulatory care delivery platform focused on high-value care and exceptional consumer satisfaction, serving more than 80 payers and 15 million individuals. Every day, OptumCare achieves superior Net Promoter Scores with physicians and consumers for delivering higher quality, lower cost, trust and consumer satisfaction and a workplace where clinicians are able to operate to their fullest professional potential in an environment deeply respectful of their profession and their practice. And now with Optum Ventures we hope to accelerate early-stage open-market innovations across the breadth of the health care services marketplace with up to $600 million in newly committed funds. Optum has the right people, the tools and assets and extraordinary market opportunities in the U.S. and globally. We're also fortunate to have in UnitedHealthcare an ideal, complementary business partner. So let me now turn it over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealthcare's CEO.\nSteven Nelson: Thank you, Larry. We're pleased to report strong growth and performance across our businesses on behalf of those we serve. In the first quarter, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 2.2 million more people after transitioning TRICARE. Highlights included market-leading growth in Medicare Advantage and duly eligible members and building a leading South American presence in both health care benefits and care delivery. Our first quarter revenues of $45.5 billion grew 13% over last year. And earnings from operations of $2.4 billion grew 12%, with an operating margin of 5.3%. Medical costs were well managed and consistent with our outlook overall. In Medicaid we continue to expect strong revenue growth in 2018. And that includes ongoing national growth serving dual special needs members, providing them aligned benefits and comprehensive service to address their oftentimes more complex care needs. We grew to serve 375,000 more seniors with medical benefits in the first 90 days of this year. As expected, we saw strong, balanced performance in retaining seniors and growing in the individual MA and group-sponsored MA markets. And we're pleased to serve another 45,000 people in Medicare Supplement. In the first quarter, Optum HouseCalls completed 342,000 home visits. We expect in 2018 to increase our visits by 12% over last year, improving our impact on the health of those we serve and their experience with UnitedHealthcare. In UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, commercial group full risk grew by 165,000 people over the past year despite a 75,000-person decrease in this quarter, consistent with our outlook on the last call. We expect now to grow in this category over the balance of this year. UnitedHealthcare Global expanded through its merger with Banm\u00e9dica, which has operations serving more than 2 million people; and the health system needs of Chile, Colombia and Peru. More broadly, UnitedHealthcare continues to deliver distinctive performance for customers and to drive consistent growth and share gains over time. We provide information to doctors about their performance across their UnitedHealthcare patient panels. Doctors want this data, and we want and need more doctors to qualify as being among our best care providers. We find the better doctors, whom we refer to as premium designated physicians, deliver consistently higher quality and average nearly 20% lower costs for a full episode of care when compared to non-premium physicians. We want to help as many of our patients as possible to be treated by these doctors. Our digital services, call advocates, consumer-centric benefit designs, nurse coaches, everything is designed to get people to the best care providers and at the best sites for care affordably. We also serve people by helping them close gaps in care, which often can be caused by deviations from evidence-based medical practice, failure to modify lifestyle behaviors or the impact of social determinants of health. This is a broad-based, collaborative approach with outreach to physicians and to people's homes through Optum's HouseCalls, through our many retail partners and through our call and digital engagement channels. We've tracked and closed tens of millions of gaps in care in the last year alone from simple things like a flu or a pneumonia vaccination to the much more complex, identifying urgent needs that save lives. They all help people live healthier lives and demonstrate to them that UnitedHealthcare compassionately cares about them. Social determinants of health like food security or stable housing issues sit upstream from and weigh heavily on gaps in care. Data from other countries and our own experience indicate social investments reduce health care costs, and addressing these social determinants is the next frontier in serving the whole person here in the U.S. That's why we are engaged in advancing more affordable housing, more reliable transportation and more sustainable employment as well as the data integration to better coordinate these and other services. Our community and state care managers and community health workers evaluate, prioritize and organize social services for people 10,000 times per month, leveraging a growing national pool of 300,000 independent community-based social service organizations. We'll continue to strengthen this capability as we learn how best to identify and coordinate these services on behalf of the members that we serve. Aligning performance is another element in driving distinctive results for people. As Dave mentioned, we estimate about half of all Americans in the next decade will receive their care through value-based coordinated care systems which integrate benefit design and consumer engagement with high-quality physician decision-making. Well executed, these approaches leverage modern technology to deliver essential care information to patients and care providers at the point of care. Today, we have more than 1,000 relationships with value-based coordinated care organizations. More than 15 million people nationwide receive a care -- receive care from a physician within these performance-based integrated care designs. Gaps are being closed in Medicare Advantage. More well-child visits are occurring in Medicaid. And in commercial benefit channels, we're seeing both lower use of the ER and lower hospital admission rates for patients treated in the ER. Commercial market integrated care arrangements outperform the overall market on 87% of quality measures, in part because consumers they serve visit primary care physicians 10% more often even as their hospitalizations are reduced by 17%. These benefits can cost 6% to 8% less overall, have lower medical cost trend and receive a favorable NPS rating from care providers. Taking these distinctive elements; blending in market-leading services from Optum; and delivering high-value, innovative health benefit plans has helped drive UnitedHealthcare's NPS health outcomes and consistent growth in recent years across our market categories. Looking forward, our internal road map highlights further investments and greater market share gains driven by each of these and other elements under development, positioning UnitedHealthcare to continue as a distinctive growth leader in modern consumer-centric health benefits. Now we'll turn this call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group's Chief Financial Officer.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Steve. Once again, we delivered strong, well-balanced performance in the quarter. Consolidated revenues exceeded $55 billion. Adjusted cash flows from operations exceeded $3.2 billion, and adjusted earnings of $3.04 per share grew 28% year-over-year. We continue to expect our 2018 medical care ratio to run in a range of 81.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Our first quarter operating cost ratio of 15.4% includes about 110 basis points from the return of the health insurance tax; and a modest impact from mix, including the effect of the Banm\u00e9dica acquisition. Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong position with significant financial flexibility. Return on equity for the first quarter was nearly 24%. And our debt-to-total capital ratio was 41.6% even as we funded Banm\u00e9dica, repurchased almost $2.7 billion of stock and distributed more than $700 million in shareholder dividend payments. Relative to reserves, our roughly $20 billion medical payable balance at quarter's end translates to 49.2 days of medical costs payable, essentially stable with 49.5 days at year-end and a year ago. Adjusted cash flows from operations of $3.2 billion were again strong this quarter at 1.1x net income. Looking ahead, our earnings outlook balances the fundamental performance strengths seen across the company in the first quarter, our usual prudent respect for medical costs inclusive of the impact of flu in the first quarter; increased investment spending in the second half as planned; and a modest in-year headwind from the health insurance tax deferral, which has increasing impact through the course of the year. Taken together, we've raised our expectations for 2018 adjusted earnings to a range of $12.40 to $12.65 per share or growth of more than 24% over 2017 at the midpoint. Dave?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. We are restless as an enterprise for positive change in health care, and we know the market is as well. That restlessness fuels the pace and intensity with which we are moving this enterprise forward on our mission. We have the right people, tools and assets for the road ahead. Our unique business alignment, capability set and areas of focus position us well for sustained growth and solid returns on capital this year and well into the future. And we are pursuing growth and diversification with emphasis in five key areas, health care delivery, pharmacy care services, consumer-centric benefits, digital health care and global. You have heard elements of our progress in each of these areas throughout our remarks this morning. And you can be sure we are focused on fully executing on this agenda to our full potential given the enormous size of the opportunities we see to serve and to grow; and ultimately provide consistent, strong returns for our shareholders. We see more opportunity and potential in the decade ahead than even the one we have just completed. And importantly, we have an organization and leadership team that is energized and humbled by the real opportunity to help make people healthier and make the health system work better for everyone. We will open the call now for questions. [Operator Instructions].\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We can take our first question from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatthew Borsch: I wanted to ask about the trend in the group commercial insured enrollment. I know that you had told us to expect the decline in the first quarter. It's just that it's noticeable relative to the strong trend that you've had over the last 3 years of market share gains in that segment. Can you talk maybe about what's changed vis-\u00e0-vis UnitedHealth Group versus competitors that -- where we're seeing a different trend for 2018?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for the question, Matt. I think UnitedHealth Group's growth overall, including its government programs, was again strong this quarter. We had forecast that first quarter commercial insured enrollment would be slightly off. And it's in fact came in that way, but Dan, can you provide some additional color on it? Dan Schumacher.\nDan Schumacher: Matt, thanks for the question. To your point, yes, we have had some very strong commercial full insured group growth over the last 3 years. And on the full year for 2018, we likewise expect a growth again, this year. As you look inside that, core of our growth is really the value we're delivering in the market. We have worked hard, as we've talked about in this forum and other forums, about expanding our product offering along the price continuum and creating high-value offerings for people. And those products are products that we are increasingly anchoring with an aligned provider base that's driving greater quality, and Steve Nelson talked to some of that in the prepared remarks; and likewise, improving our consumer experience inside that. To the quarter specifically, we continued to do well in small business. That's a particularly important market segment for us. Our middle market results were tempered, as we shared with you at the investor conference and last quarter. And that really related to how competitors chose to address the reintroduction of the health insurers tax at the employer customer level. So we maintained our focus on pricing to our costs. We included it and, frankly, think that we struck the right balance doing so. Given that the middle market selling season is concentrated in the first half of the year, you will see us return to growth as we progress through the year. And I'd tell you all of that is very consistent with the guidance we've provided you at the investor conference.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: First, just a couple of questions on Optum. First, can you discuss the financial and product implications of providing rebates directly to consumers at retail for 2019? And then can you walk us through the drivers of the Optum margin improvement here? And any comments on the naming of Andrew Witty as the new CEO of Optum and what you expect him to bring to the business?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure, Justin. Thank you for the question. We're not going to get into guidance on 2019 at this stage, so pardon us for skipping over that element of it. Tim Wicks, can you talk about margins?\nTimothy Wicks: Sure, absolutely. So Justin, first of all, thanks for your question. And as I look at the first quarter of the year, obviously we're pleased with the results. And thinking about the double-digit growth we had in each of the Optum segments, we also expect to be able to maintain and have that double-digit earnings growth throughout the year. If we look at each of the metrics in the businesses, those would be the real drivers of the return. So continued momentum in script growth at OptumRx at 332 million scripts, up 3% year-over-year; and that's really due to client membership expansion. If we look at OptumInsight, the backlog growth up 16% year-over-year. And that's really driven by growth in Optum360; Optum government; and then Optum connect, which is our health care IT business. And then the -- and then ultimately, in OptumHealth really focusing on the number of consumers served, which is up 11%, excluding TRICARE. And a lot of that is really driven by the year-over-year and SCA as well as care delivery expansion, growth in consumer solutions MedExpress parts of our business as well. And then really just focusing in terms of overall advances in productivity across each of our businesses really helped drive operating leverage as well. So each of those were the real drivers of the operating and the financial improvements over the quarter.\nDavid Wichmann: So hopefully, that was responsive, Justin. Do you want to address the point-of-sale rebate question more globally, if we can? Just because that was a shift here in the first quarter. So Dan Schumacher?\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Justin, with respect to point-of-sale rebates, I -- from our perspective, we think it's an important step forward. Obviously pharmacy is the most commonly used consumer benefit. And underneath that, the high list prices for medication that's set by manufacturers are -- they're having a major impact on consumers' out-of-pocket costs. And so in partnership with OptumRx, UnitedHealthcare wants to support consumers in accessing the lowest possible costs of their medication. So to that end, beginning 1/1/2019, for more than 7 million fully insured members we are changing our practice to apply manufacturer rebates at the point of sale for consumers. So today, we apply rebates towards reducing overall premium, so shifting it to the point of sale has a very minimal impact overall but has a very big impact to individuals taking those impacted drugs. And I would tell you this is just one step in part of a broader effort by OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare to continue to deliver savings directly to consumers, to really simplify that pharmacy benefit and improve the overall health care experience.\nDavid Wichmann: So just try to bring more value to those individuals who have the greatest need, those that show up to the pharmacy counter; really trying to drive greater levels of affordability, which obviously will have considerable benefits to them in terms of their overall health and management. And with respect to Andrew Witty joining us, Justin, we're very pleased that he's going to be joining us. As indicated in the announcement, that'll be about the middle of the year. Andrew was here last week. He spent some time with our team, and it's clear that he's going to add considerable capability and capacity to Optum and to UnitedHealth Group broadly. Maybe some of the things I appreciate most about Andrew, just so you have at least my context around this, is his strategic capacities. He has very strong global health care insights. And he's very strong on information and advanced technology both in terms of his curiosity, which is enlightening; as well as his understanding of these areas and what the practical applications are of advanced technologies and information in health care broadly. He also has a very balanced social conscience as well as a growth and financial return orientation; and excels in things like brand, NPS and his consumer skills broadly. And of course, the knowledge that he has around pharmacy is extremely helpful at this critical time in health care broadly. I want to emphasize this is a leadership addition to our organization; in addition, an addition to Larry, who will take on enterprise-wide growth responsibilities for UnitedHealth Group and is overseeing a very robust Optum Ventures platform with about $600 million of committed capital. But leadership is something we have a lot in this company. And in fact, in the room here with me today, we have a lot of the talent that we've attracted over the last year, Andrew Hayek, as an example; Peter Pronovost; Stephanie Fehr; Ken Eller; Patty Horoho; Robert Musslewhite; and many others, too many to really mention. And each and every one of these are courageous, market-based leaders; and I think is a testament to this organization's ability to be able to track that level of talent and deploy it onto the field of health care. So you're going to continue to see that kind of activity where we are acquiring talent, if you will, cultivating the development of that talent. And we're working to retain them, but what you should take away from all that is people are a strength of this company. And we have 285,000 of them, all working in a single direction around advancing a noble mission of UnitedHealth Group.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Thinking about Medicare Advantage and the strong growth that you're seeing there this year. As you approach bid strategy for 2019 here in this quarter, with now-we-know strong rate increase for next year [indiscernible] for next year, I guess I'm interested in your philosophy around stability of benefits and how you think you might deploy the kind of what looks to be excess funds available to Medicare Advantage for next year.\nDavid Wichmann: David, we're always trying to keep benefits, premiums, networks, pharmacies as stable as possible for our MA participants. That is the way you enhance retention but also ensure that they have consistent-quality health care. Pete, Brian, do you want to comment?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Dave. As you said at the outset, we are very pleased with our strong start to the year here in 2018. We are staying aligned to our expectations and the growth not only for the commitments we made but we're also really pleased with the mix of where that growth is. It's really tilted towards very strong well-performing markets for us. So pleased with the start to 2018. As you said, as we look forward to 2019, we are encouraged by the direction of the 2019 rates, up nearly 3 points versus last year. I think it's important to remember the context against the backdrop of a program that has been chronically underfunded over 13% over the past 9 years. So the 2019 rates were needed. They were necessary to cover program costs and keep benefits stable and strong for seniors and help continue our advances in quality and in innovation, but also beyond the rates we're encouraged by what we're seeing with respect to policy changes, several policy changes really providing the framework for continued momentum and popularity. I think we'll see expanded senior choice, more customization of specific population benefits and really the flexibility to expand the value of our benefits, all really very positive advances for those served and those choosing Medicare Advantage. As we look forward, we will certainly approach 2019 with an optimistic mindset and expect for the broad-based benefit stability in the marketplace at large.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the 2019 selling season, I guess, both on the managed care side and the PBM side; I guess, on the managed care side addressing kind of the question about how you're seeing the competitors think about tax reform impacting that through. I guess there's some concern about the Blues into next year. And on the PBM side, with all the deals being announced, how your competitors might be responding to that and whether there's any opportunity or risk to pricing heading into next year.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, I think we'll start with Dan on the managed care side, and then we'll flip to John Prince on PBM.\nDan Schumacher: Kevin, with regards to the national account selling season, I would tell you that it's -- at this point, it's very early in the decision cycle. The pipeline itself is a little bit larger, but also the amount that we're defending. For the portion that's resolved at this point, I would say that the early theme is one around incumbency, but at the enterprise we think we have a lot to offer employers looking for progressive solutions to benefits for their employees. And likewise, we expect to again be successful in 2019 on converting retirees into group Medicare Advantage offerings. So we'll look to give you updates on the selling season as we progress through the year. I think you also tucked in a question around tax and pricing inside that I think probably aimed more towards the fully insured marketplace. And I would say at this point we haven't seen any measurable change in pricing related to the tax itself. The reality is the impact is somewhere around 0.5 points, give or take a little bit. Plus, companies have expressed interest in investing some of that money as well, so it gets diluted further. So at this point, we haven't seen anything specific related to the tax pricing.\nDavid Wichmann: And on the PBM?\nJohn Prince: Yes. Kevin, it's John Prince. I'd say, in terms of the PBM, the market is still invested in the 2019 selling season for large groups. The activity is very strong, but the season is still developing, especially if you look at 1/1/19 and beyond. We've had some good success initially in the market. We've sold some large-, also some medium-size health plan business as well as some large employers, but the vast majority of the decisions in the mid to large are still pending. So you asked a question about pricing, pricing is very competitive, but I'd say it's stable. And I'd say also, in terms of the value story and how we're positioned ourselves relative to our competitor, I'd say our value story is resonating in the market. We've been able to really differentiate ourselves in 3 key points. One, people like our message around [indiscernible] price for drugs. Two is the focus on total cost of care and how we bring medical and pharmacy together to reduce the total costs for our clients. And third is our focus on the consumer. And I think you heard today around PreCheck MyScript, our focus on point-of-sale rebates. Other innovations we're doing in the market around best price are really differentiating ourselves in the market. And so our story to the market is really simple, we're focused on our clients. We're focused on our consumers. We have an 8-quarter road map that we're executing against those 3 key components, and it's resonating very well. So we're very pleased of how the season started, and a lot more to share as the season progresses.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.\nSarah James: The earnings beat was a little bit more than double the guidance raise, so can you walk us through bits and points of conservatism or maybe some offsets and headwinds that would bridge us to the beat versus the guidance raise? And then you're estimating that tax coming below guidance is about $0.10 of a beat, so is the 24% guidance on tax rate still the right number for the year?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. I can tell you, well, the earnings beat and the forward guidance are a little disconnected because of some of the headwinds we expect or have already experienced in 2017 and expect for -- or 2018, excuse me, and expect for the balance of the year as well. So John will discuss those as well as the tax item.\nJohn Rex: Yes. John Rex here. Thanks for the question. So I would just also note that the earnings beat is against a consensus view and -- but is more in line with our expectations in terms of where we would -- where we seek to perform. Let me just talk about a few of the other components here, though, as you talk about the tax rate. So also, tax rate really in line with our view. So our view is approximately 24% for the year. That's still the case, and the 1Q effective tax rate was in line with our own expectations. So the main factor that is driving the lower tax rate in the first half of the year is driven by the share-based accounting rule changes that were implemented in -- a couple years ago, the beginning of '16, I believe. So -- and the pattern of our share-based awards creates a higher level of vestings and exercises in the first half, and that's been consistent over time. That 2016 change then drove more volatility in the earnings as a result. And the exercise of share-based awards supports that impact and dependent upon share price and shareholder activity, so a little more difficult to project, but I'd say kind of where we came in, in the 1Q was in line with our expectations. So history continues to be a guide. We expect our lowest effective tax rate in the first half, with 1Q typically somewhat lower than 2Q but depends on activity there. And then there is typically much less exercise activity in the second half of the year, which results in the -- in our highest rates being in that period.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Sarah.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Tanal: Sarah's on mute there. I was hoping to better understand the ongoing impact of aging in your existing book of business. I wondered if you could tell us the percent of commercial enrollment, aging, at the Medicare annually; or maybe an average age of the commercial book; and then an average age with Medicare Advantage. And just a quick kind of related follow-up on the 2019 MA rates, what do you guys expect to see in your overall yields ? And how are you thinking about the expected effect of growth rate in the CMS build up as well as the coding trend number?\nDavid Wichmann: Well, collectively, I think we'll organize that into what are the drivers in Medicare giving rise to growth in Medicare. And then also, if you have -- Brian, if you have additional comments on the growth rate, that would be fine, on the [indiscernible].\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Steve. Brian Thompson here. Maybe I'll start with a view to our book. We really -- well, we have shown tremendous growth, as you know, in Medicare Advantage over the course of the last four years. We've still been very stable in terms of our demographics and our underlying mix, so we really haven't seen a big shift there, really strong growth. And retention obviously playing a real big role in that growth has really enabled that stability of our book. As we look forward, we have signaled we expect a long-term growth rate in Medicare Advantage around 8%. I think that'll ebb and flow mildly. I would look to 2019 and still expect it probably within that range. As you know, over the course of the past four years, we've meaningfully outperformed that and gained share against that. You made mention around the growth rate being pretty strong inside these rates. I don't like to break down the componentry of the rating buildup. I think you need to look at them all in the broad context, again, of being stronger than it has been historically; several things playing into that strong growth rate, though, for 2019, some of which was some of the statements related to prior years. And as you know, we've suggested an underfunding in prior years, and I think that's supported with the growth rate strength. And some CMS incentive payment changes for their MACRA program et cetera that relate specifically to fee-for-service Medicare. So nothing really in that growth rate that we're seeing that would really -- anything to be gleaned with respect to forward cost trend for us. So again, really optimistic about the outlook very stable in terms of our own book and margin profiles, again aided in large part by our strong, really record-setting retention that we've seen year-over-year.\nDavid Wichmann: So we'd expect continued growth in the Medicare Advantage product lines, both supported by the market broadly as well as our individual capacities to create distinctive offerings and serve seniors.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.\nPeter Costa: Jumping up from that on Medicare Advantage, can you talk a little bit about the increasing presence we're seeing from competitors such as Aetna and Anthem growing their Medicare Advantage businesses, even the not-for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans? You're seeing much more geographic expansion from many of the players as well as offering more Medicare Advantage plans. And given the pricing environment, are you concerned at all, if the CVS projections on cost trend are correct, that you're going to see a much tougher environment in 2019 than people expect at this current point in time?\nDavid Wichmann: Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Thanks for the question, Peter. From our vantage point, this marketplace has always been very competitive. For me, it's really less about newfound competitive dynamics; and really more about the optimism we have, the optimism of ushering more seniors into the value Medicare Advantage offers really industry wide. As I said, the Medicare Advantage market continues to be severely underpenetrated. It's 33% today. We see a path, as we mentioned previously, to over 50% over the next 5 to 10 years. And we believe this set of policies and the funding that we see in 2019 are enablers in that regard. So we expect really good, broad-based benefit stability; and are very optimistic about both the industry and our position in it; and think it's great for seniors and the program popularity at large.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for the question, Peter.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJoshua Raskin: I wanted to talk a little bit about the comments that you were making about this movement towards value-based care and that 50% of the population will be in there in a few years; and then kind of juxtapose that with all of the work you guys are doing on sort of retail attachment points, right, and specifically around MedExpress and some of the physician groups that you're working with. So I just wanted to understand. How does that work together? How do we get more coordinated, more value-based care in the OptumCare physicians; and then also have this huge growth in what look like retail settings and what tends to be a little bit more episodic or fragmented care with less connection to the primary care docket at a nursing care center, for example?\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question, Josh. I'll have Andrew Hayek talk about the OptumCare strategy more broadly, but I think you could see at least 2 of the 5 growth categories that we've laid out for some time now are clearly aimed at this as well as a few other macro trends that we expect to develop over the course of the next decade or so. With UnitedHealthcare, it's been working towards advancing more consumer-centric benefits. And you've seen that as one of the core fuels, if you will, for the growth that they've experienced over the course of the past couple few years. In particular as we look forward, we see consumer-centric benefit profile that continues to refine. These are benefits that really respond to the unique needs of individual consumers, on the one hand. And at -- on the other hand, they are accessing well-informed and technology-enabled, performance-based networks that provide very high-quality, lower-cost and -- care that more deeply satisfies the consumer's individual needs. And so that's the evolution that we see on that front. Obviously, we've also invested in OptumCare, and we've taken some pretty bold steps to build out that strategy broadly across several markets so far. We have a ways to go yet and we're in our early stages of development overall, but clearly we see an opportunity to advance those 3 objectives as well, lower costs, higher quality and greater levels of patient satisfaction, while providing a strong environment for doctors to practice in that business. Andrew, more comments on OptumCare and where we're headed?\nAndrew Hayek: Thanks, Dave. And Josh, appreciate the question. I think there's a tight interplay between the consumer-centric evolution of the health care system and our OptumCare platform. So a couple comments. As you know, we're positioned to be the leading high-value medical group and ambulatory care organization in the country with an ambition to serve 75 markets. And we're enabling this transition to value-oriented and more consumer-centric care and through our models to improve the quality, experience and total cost of health care through deploying advanced technology and data that leverage the breadth and depth of capabilities within Optum to promote delivery of evidence-based medicine and improve the consumer experience. And the results are really powerful in terms of stars; HEDIS measures; Net Promoter Scores, to your point, around a more consumer-centric world. And OptumCare NPS scores approach 80. In our MedExpress and SCA sites, they're averaging a similar range, so very, very strong consumer experience. And then of course, it plays right into reducing the total cost of care, as was shared in the earnings script. In terms of MedExpress, there's a tight interplay that the MedExpress neighborhood care centers are a very consumer-centric front door to the health care ecosystem, and that's evidenced by their high NPS. And then through that front door, we're able to help patients access the right providers, including our OptumCare value-oriented medical groups; similarly with SCA surgery centers, very consumer-centric experience that ties in -- really in a very complementary manner to value-based care and driving quality experience and total cost. So we think these components really fit together nicely the ambitions of where UHG and other leading payers in the country want to go, and we feel really good about the impact in the communities we serve.\nDavid Wichmann: And Josh, the these same designs are being deployed in South America, and the early returns on those are very positive as well. We're starting with Brazil, some of which take on care features where we're utilizing our delivery system very tightly. And others are more broadly accessing network-based care. And we can see the same type of designs working in the other 3 South American countries we just advanced as well, so broadly speaking, we think these are -- this is a trend that we'll see evolve globally as well as right here in the United States. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.\nGary Taylor: Just a quick two-parter. The first is when we look at cost of goods sold. First time in four years, that's been down year-over-year in the first quarter. Just wondering if there's any specific color there. And then secondly, how much of the annual EPS raise might be related to the Banm\u00e9dica acquisition?\nDavid Wichmann: We'll have Tim Wicks talk to the cost of goods sold. And John Rex can talk Banm\u00e9dica.\nTimothy Wicks: Great. Gary, Tim Wicks. Thanks for the question. The key, I think, for focusing on the year-over-year change in COGS in Rx is really around productivity and operating leverage that's there, so a couple of things. Obviously, we've continued to be active and will continue to be in the supply chain, but also just from an accounting perspective, there are some operating costs that get classified into COGS. And those are really around serving our clients, particularly home delivery and specialty clients. And we've continued to invest pretty substantially in technology and automation and improve our operating efficiency really while aiming at specifically for various most likely improved NPS at the same time. And so that's really the driver year-over-year.\nJohn Rex: Gary, John Rex here. So on an annual basis on -- and for GAAP earnings, Banm\u00e9dica is neutral. For adjusted EPS, it's $0.05 a share. And that's the amortization impacts of Banm\u00e9dica coming into the equation.\nDavid Wichmann: And just as a reminder, Banm\u00e9dica will be going into winter here in this Q2 and Q3, so it'll actually be a little bit dilutive during that time period. Then it'll come back out in Q4, Q1.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Maybe I'll just ask broadly about capital deployment. You're bouncing around now around 40% debt-to-cap. This quarter, you're a little above. Last quarter, you were a little low. It seems like that's probably a good set point. I just want to confirm that for you. And then so if you go forward with your capital from there -- you stepped up the buyback in the quarter. Does -- that $1.65 billion bought, does that impact the full year expectation of $3 billion to $4 billion that you laid out last quarter? And then I know sometimes you set priorities for investments across the business. Obviously that's a big portion of your cash flow to reinvest in the business. And sometimes, I know you guys have highlighted that certain areas of Optum or whatever are getting above-average investments. If there are some of those going on, can you highlight priorities of investments back in the business?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Sure. Let me start with the couple of capital questions here, A.J. So still committed to our long-term 40% debt-to-cap ratio here, so no change from that view on we're expect to be in that zone, that we'll be in that 40% zone. In terms of the share repurchase activity in the quarter, $2.65 billion, we're still tracking to our full year outlook of the $3 billion to $4 billion; as I said, still highly committed to our debt-to-total capital ratio objective. And you should expect to continue to see it, but you're correct. We were able to accomplish a good amount in 1Q given the market conditions, but we will still end the year in that zone even kind of with the things we've discussed thus far in terms of other things coming into the mix of that over the course of the year. In terms of the capital allocation, so I would say no big shifts there. I mean I think it's really kind of the elements that Dave has articulated in terms of the types of investments we want to make in the company in terms of where we're putting the capital, but I wouldn't tell you there has been a big shift. And it's very consistent with the elements that Dave laid out. It's...\nDavid Wichmann: So A.J., as we've indicated before, we have a strong interest in continuing to build our services business. There's a lot of platforms there that we believe can aid significantly the performance of health systems broadly. Obviously we're making a significant investment in care delivery. We have been on a pretty consistent pace with respect to that. And we are also investing in technology [Technical Difficulty] the capital allocated to Optum Ventures, as we see a growing number of smaller, well-suited organizations that we are partnering with to really open-source innovation into UnitedHealth Group. So those would be just a couple of categories. Obviously we invested in Banm\u00e9dica in January 31 of this year, so global is still a place where we are making very measured investments and -- but I'd suggest to you that we're looking to add market presence and capability across our business. And you can expect us to still be very strong deployers of capital, recognizing that we want to maintain a very strong balance sheet. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to the Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley.\nZachary Sopcak: I just wanted to ask, in the quarter, the -- if you could quantify the impact of flu on the medical care ratio. And when you think about the interplay or mix between flu and, I guess, everything else, were there any surprises relative to your expectations?\nDavid Wichmann: Zack, it was a little hard to hear you, but I think you were asking about the impact of the flu on the medical care ratio. Is that right?\nZachary Sopcak: Yes, in the quarter and that versus everything else.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, why don't we have John Rex take that?\nJohn Rex: Yes, Zack. So in the quarter, the impact of influenza on MCR would be about 40 basis points. And just a few things that I'd like to point out on that, though. So I think the way we think about it, flu is just one factor that can and often does occur in any given year. And you should expect that's what -- we do our best to manage through that as we provide good care and actives for our patients and can control the costs appropriately. That's what we do here. And at the same time, and Dave referenced this, we're increasingly diversified in our health businesses. Some benefits of that, we have this relatively small but growing presence in the southern hemisphere, where the first quarter for the southern hemisphere is also the height of summer. And that's experience of seasonally low utilization. In addition, our growing domestic care delivery businesses had a very busy first quarter, which is another balancing quarter, a factor in the payer. So to be sure, these businesses are modest in scope when you compare them to the domestic help businesses, but it is having impact. And so you should increasingly see, as a broad-based health care company, that -- rather than solely an insurer, you should expect us to continue to work, overcome those factors and deliver the consistent and balanced growth that you saw in this quarter.\nDavid Wichmann: It's the value of a diversified business being able to overcome what are headwinds and that I have to spend a lot of time discussing them in this venue.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.\nAnagha Gupte: I was hoping you could give us some update on the progress you're making with the [indiscernible] relationships and health systems, how that dovetails with the appointment of Larry Renfro across both UHC and Optum; and then how that also dovetails with OptumCare and your strategy as hospitals and health systems are investing more in ambulatory things like urgent care, ASCs based on intensive care and the like.\nDavid Wichmann: I'm sorry, Ana. We missed the fourth part of your question. You cut out at, I think, a critical time around context, so can you -- if you're on a handset, if you can pick up your handset, please.\nAnagha Gupte: Yes. Sorry about that. [Indiscernible] question was around ABCO relationships and how that dovetails with Larry Renfro's change into -- across UHC and Optum. And then also, as health systems are investing in ASCs and based on intensive care, urgent care, it seems like, on a more accelerated basis, how is that dovetailing with OptumInsight and OptumCare and your contracts across UHC and Optum?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you very much. I think we got it that time. So maybe we'll start with -- there's 3 elements there. The ABCO relationship, Eric Murphy can address that. I think you asked about Renfro and his transition. I can touched -- base on that, as well as Larry himself. And then Andrew address the ASCs.\nEric Murphy: Yes. We are very pleased with the progress we've been making and in line with our expectations relative to the integration of Advisory Board organization with OptumInsight. We've fully integrated our provider go-to-market teams and our consulting services business, and as a result, we're seeing favorable market receptivity and pipeline development across our provider business. We're also launching within our research business expansion in the both payer market in the second quarter of this year and then the life sciences market in Q4. So we're very pleased with the progress that we're making as we put the Advisory Board organization together with OptumInsight.\nDavid Wichmann: And then on the second front maybe as it relates to the Renfro transition which will occur to UnitedHealth Group and more broadly focused on Optum Ventures here towards the middle of the year, I think Larry is very much a courageous leader of this organization. He's going to be with us for a very long time. We're super enthusiastic about that. He has had a very strong stretch at Optum, I would say, probably the most formidable stretch in that organization's 20-year history over the course of the last 7 years. If you think about the things that we discussed in the script today, the where we've been from and to, a lot of those are under Larry's leadership, obviously the leadership broadly of this Optum team. You probably can tell also that Optum is in pretty strong position right now and is performing exceptionally well. Now it's always the time period that we look to, to make these kinds of transitions. And I would expect Optum to perform very well throughout the balance of the year and obviously in part due to Larry's leadership. He's not going anywhere. He's going to be around. He is going to be joining us at UnitedHealth Group and helping me run UHG broadly but really focused on an area of expertise that he has, which is around [indiscernible] which you've seen in Optum over this time, but also really continuing to advance relationships and the relationship model broadly across our business. But I also want to underscore the intensity upon which we need to focus on continue to open-source innovation, particularly around venture-based enterprises; and how important that is to our business to continue to grow and prosper 5, 10 years down the road as we develop these competencies in our organization. Larry, do you have anything to add or maybe where we're focusing some of our investments in ventures?\nLarry Renfro: Sure. Maybe I'll hit a couple of points. Ana, it's Larry. Today, it is business as usual, up until July 1, so don't think that anyone is going to take their eye off the ball. So I mean it is absolutely business as usual. We're going through a process of putting together a program for enterprise relationships and how that's going to work for existing accounts that we have today and how we're going to continue to work with them as well as how we're going to use different programs that we also do today to develop larger relationships and new relationships. So there's an overall program being put together on the enterprise side. And as Dave said, a tremendous effort will go into ventures. We started and announced about ventures back in the -- I guess, November, December, at the investor conference. And the response has been overwhelming with a number of health companies as well as a number of venture groups, and the pipeline is extremely strong, so we've -- we're off to a solid start. It would be around all the type of areas you would think about, whether it's health analytics with AI, big data, machine learning and quite a few situations that are developing with companies and so forth. We're also into digital care as well as consumer care, yes, as well as just looking at the overall health care system. So we're up and running in terms of putting programs together. We'll kick really in as of July, when Andrew gets here. We're -- I didn't get a chance to talk a few minutes ago, but in strengthening the relationships that we'll have with Andrew here, I think it'll just allow us to move forward in some of these initiatives that we're talking about today or we're talking about right now to really create even a more of a -- well, I'll say a new but an expanded growth engine for Optum. So we're looking forward to it.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Larry. We are running a little long today, so we'll take 2 more questions. Hopefully, you found that our answers have been pretty fulsome here this morning and got to the -- most of the interests for the callers today.\nOperator: And we'll go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: It seems like you've been a little bit more outspoken of late on certain providers and sort of calling out what you see as egregious practices. I guess the question is more broader, though, in terms of whether you're seeing more of this today than maybe in the past, if you've come up against sort of more stalemates with providers around contract disputes and sort of more out-of-network claims coming through. And if you can frame at all and estimate on sort of medical cost savings that you can maybe achieve by sort of reining in some practices specifically on the pricing side.\nDavid Wichmann: We'll have Steve Nelson, our Chief Executive of UnitedHealthcare, take that.\nSteven Nelson: So thank you for the question. Ralph, it's we've talked a lot about this morning actually how we're trying to drive value with our partnerships and delivery system on behalf of the members that we serve. And obviously it's not going to get into specific conversations, but I'll tell you that we're making a lot of progress there. And it's coming through, as we talked about in both experience, the outcomes and also affordability. And it's broad based, but it's also relative to the conversations we've had this morning on OptumCare and the value we're seeing there as well. But I might just ask Dan Schumacher to talk a little about how we're advancing the conversations and our just holistic value relationships with the delivery system.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Ralph, to your specific question on out of network, we've actually been able to drive that down as a percentage of total spend over the last several years, so making nice progress there. And the reality is all of that's part of our efforts that we've been undertaking for several years to drive towards a value-based health care system. And there's two principal parts to that, first, looking to increase the amount of spend under value-based contracts; and then secondly and importantly, migrating that spend along the risk continuum, so towards managing the health of an overall population. On the amount, right now we've got nearly $65 billion or about half of our medical surgical spend in value-based constructs. That's a year earlier that we had expected to arrive at that destination, and so we've now set our sights towards $75 billion by 2020. And then we've also been very successful in migrating our incentives towards managing the health of a population. So we've moved that. five years ago, about 38% of that value-based spend was in those more progressive relationships. So we've migrated that up to about half as of today, and we'll continue to push forward on that. And as Steve mentioned, we've driven some very nice results across all three lines of business. We see things like lower in-patients' admission rates, lower readmission rates, lower ER use, higher primary care use, more preventative screening, better-quality outcomes on the most commonly tracked metrics. So some very strong results. These practices start with a better baseline, and then they trend at a better rate. In terms of sizing that, somewhere in the 1% to 3% range on a trend basis year in and year out, better than the folks that are outside of these relationships. So we will continue to seek to partner with people that share our vision around driving a truly value-based health care system.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Ralph.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Real quick question on strategic progress you're making in a couple of these areas. The first one is related to OptumCare. I'm just interested in the pace at which you're able to transition the physician practices over to risk and how much penetration you're getting out of risk. And then the other aspect to this is online pharmacy. I'm just interested in what sort of investments you guys are making on enhancing your mail capabilities, where your penetration rates for mail are at and what you see as M&A potential opportunity in the online pharmacy space for you guys.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Lance. So we'll start with Andrew Hayek on the pace of transition in OptumCare, and then we'll cover out the pharmacy question as well.\nAndrew Hayek: Thanks, Dave. Lance, appreciate the question. With OptumCare, we're partnering with medical groups who really embrace the transition to value. That's why they choose to partner with us. And many of them are starting in traditional fee-for-service markets with that kind of current fee construct, and they want to migrate towards value-oriented care. That shift to value, it encompasses their clinical programs, their compensation programs, their culture. It's a pretty broad-based change. We tend to make a transition in those areas; and then work with payers in that marketplace, obviously we serve multiple payers across the country, to shift our fee-for-service arrangements to more of a value orientation. And then we also tend to focus on how we get into deep risk, especially in the senior area where we can be a very collaborative partner with Medicare Advantage plans and drive great value. That transition really depends on the starting point, but it inevitably involves a couple few years, sometimes longer. Again, we're talking about changes in clinical practice, compensation, culture. These are deep and broad changes. We're pleased with the progress. We're pleased with the results we see. And obviously, the further we get into that value orientation, the better and better the results get. As Dan indicated earlier, we see outstanding quality in terms of stars and HEDIS. We see outstanding Net Promoter Scores, and then we see lower medical cost trends. And those results accelerate the further we get into risk.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Then John Prince.\nJohn Prince: Lance, John Prince. Let's talk a little about online pharmacy. Let's maybe cover three broad points on it. First of all is quality. Clinical [indiscernible] a customer strength. So when you look at the online pharmacy, the quality is much higher than any other venue you can get your medication. The second, if you look at clinical effectiveness and medication adherence, it's much better outcomes when you look at online experiences in our home delivery and specialty. But the third and probably most important one is the investment in the consumer experience. That's where we've been investing significantly in the last few years around how do we drive a higher NPS, Net Promoter Score. What is our turnaround time? How do we think about our experience? And our metrics have changed dramatically every quarter in terms of how quickly we can sell a drug. What is the experience how quickly to be able to get to their doorstep? And really investing also in that online experience. So we redid our digital platform last year. We continue to invest in our app, the relevant speed of our online experience. We've made a lot of progress. I'm really pleased we've seen about a 25-point improvement in our Net Promoter Score over the last few years, so a great experience. You've seen that in our results both in the home delivery and specialty area, around our increased acceleration of our volume there. And that's just because we're winning more in the market. We're getting higher capture rate, greater experience, but this is an area where I think there's a lot more potential. Still 80% of prescriptions in the industry are filled in the retail setting. The retail online experience has not really taken over, and I see tremendous opportunity. And we're investing in that. We're also investing in these combined centers, where we're moving our infusion, our specialties and home delivery into regions so we can actually move the same day. We've made a significant investment over the last few years to do that. So all of these pieces all fit together to create a greater consumer experience, which will continue to accelerate our online performance.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. And thank you for the question, Lance. Again I apologize for not getting to everybody today. Hopefully, you found our responses to be fulsome and a nice augmentation to our release and the prepared remarks that we had for you today. But to sum up that report. UnitedHealth Group entered 2018 with strong momentum, once again delivering solid, well-balanced growth. Optum is serving more consumers and clients than ever before, driving higher revenues, margins and operating earnings. And UnitedHealthcare continued to deliver distinctive growth, serving 2.2 million more people in the first quarter, getting the best care providers and at the best sites for care affordably. Based on the overall performance of our business and our forward view, we've raised our outlook for adjusted earnings per share. We will continue to work to improve the quality of health care and its value for the people we serve one person and one health system at a time. Thank you.\nOperator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."}], "2020": [{"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-15 20:56:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports & SEC Filings section of the company\u2019s Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 15, 2020, which maybe accessed from the Investors page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Six weeks ago, we had the privilege of spending the day with many of you at our annual investor conference providing an in-depth look at the accelerating opportunities we see to serve more people, more deeply and to grow strongly into 2020 and well beyond. As we conclude 2019 and step into the New Year, the performance of our business strengthens our confidence in the themes, opportunities and outlooks of that day, as evidenced by today\u2019s results. We remain highly focused on driving affordability, innovating with consumer and customer responsive products and services, improving operating performance and advancing NPS. Full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share were stronger than our investor conference outlook growing 17% for the year to $15.11 per share. Full year revenues exceeded $242 billion growing $16 billion over 2018 with notable gains in our Medicare, care delivery and pharmacy care services businesses. Full year cash flows were $18.5 billion or 1.3x net income. We finished the year encouraged by continued performance improvement in Medicaid. Early market interest in our new innovative line of employer sponsored benefit offerings and 2020 individual Medicare Advantage annual enrollment results, which were our strongest ever. Within our Medicare Advantage offerings including dual eligible growth, we expect to serve nearly 700,000 more people in 2020, the upper end of the range of performance offered at our investor conference. Our fourth quarter medical and operating cost positions continued to improve meaningfully enterprise-wide with ample opportunity for further progress on both of these fronts and our NPS improved nicely in 2019 across our businesses, particularly within network care providers, enrollees in Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans as well as patients served by our OptumCare and pharmacy care services businesses. Improved costs and higher satisfaction propelled by meaningful innovation allow us to contribute more comprehensively to the development and deployment of the kind of next generation health system needed in the U.S. and globally, a more forward-looking modern health system built around the people we serve seamlessly woven into their lives, simple, convenient, transparent and compassionate, a health system that is more affordable creates the better experience for both patients and physicians and improves health outcomes. The health system we are helping to build will better meet the personalized needs of people. It leverages the next generation data analytics such as the individual health record to empower patients and their doctors with actionable intelligence that drives next best actions to improve decision-making in real time. We are committed to a future where every person has access to high-quality affordable healthcare that meets their unique healthcare needs and financial means. We are employing specific actions to help achieve this driving better health outcomes and aiming ultimately to reduce the healthcare cost trends to general inflation levels even with an aging, more chronically ill population. Notably, the bipartisan repeal of the ACA taxes in December was the strongest step towards improving affordability for Americans. It will greatly assist those who have been most affected by the cost of those taxes, especially seniors, small employers and those who are individually insured. As we continue to do better for those we serve, we will grow helping improve the health system, one person at a time intensely focused on driving improved consumer and physician experiences. Looking to the years ahead, our strengthening capabilities and diversified complementary businesses operating in the large growing healthcare market positioned us well to achieve our long-term adjusted earnings per share growth rate objective of 13% to 16%, while we continue as always to invest in the future for sustainable, market-leading performance and advancing shareholder returns. With that, let me turn it to UnitedHealth Group President and Optum Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Witty to discuss Optum\u2019s results and momentum heading into the New Year.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Dave. At Optum, we are encouraged and humbled by the expanding opportunities to grow and serve more people more deeply. There is a distinct energy and eagerness across our businesses as we enter 2020. In 2019, Optum revenues reached $113 billion growing 12% year-over-year. Total operating earnings grew 14% to $9.4 billion. OptumHealth revenues reached $30.3 billion in 2019, up 26% led by OptumCare, our care delivery business. We are steadily expanding into new geographies and expanding the depth and breadth of services in existing regions to further provide patients with the highest quality, convenient and affordable health services. One measure that helps illustrate how we are serving people more comprehensively is revenue per consumer served, which grew 26% in the quarter. This measure will continue strongly advancing as we further build out our integrated care delivery network. Turning to OptumRx, revenues of $74.3 billion grew 7% even with the previously discussed impact of the single large customer transition. The 2020 selling season for core pharmacy benefit services has now mostly concluded and it was our strongest ever. Through our other pharmacy care and specialty drug businesses, given our current positions we see significant opportunity to more fully serve patients\u2019 pharmacy needs in their communities and drive better adherence and clinical outcome. At OptumInsight, revenues of $10 billion grew 11% and the revenue backlog was up 14% to $19.3 billion. OptumInsight perhaps more than any of our other businesses has a dual role; it has both unmatched capability to help distinguish our other businesses and serves as a profitable, growing externally facing business on its own. I would like to spend a few extra minutes this morning on how we view OptumInsight and why we are encouraged by its potential. I will start with the foundations. First, deep data and advanced analytics are at the core supporting modern technologies and platforms to make the health system more interoperable, transparent and efficient. Second, research, consulting and large scale managed services enabled by data analytics and digital and operational innovations made the consumer experience simpler, smarter and more compassionate. And third, clinical expertise, combined with rich data and analytics drive measurably better patient care and outcomes, reduce its friction while lowering the total cost of care. We are connecting the health system to deliver better outcomes, low cost and an improved experience for patients and their clinicians. This includes developing the connected infrastructure that integrates clinical systems, revenue management platforms and administrative claims transactions to enable critical bi-drectional data exchange. Our solutions are harmonizing and organizing billions of transactions while applying considerable intelligence through our advanced technologies, clinical ontologies and data analytics capabilities. We want to ensure critical decision support information gets to the right people at the right time with rigorous protocols to protect patient privacy all while offering full transparency of health system performance on both quality and cost. Our Optum 360 business helps health systems and hospitals improve revenue performance and patient experience. We deploy natural language processing for computer-assisted coding and documentation and provide data interchange and information exchange solutions as well as patient access services. Optum 360 now manages about $70 billion in annual billings for unaffiliated customers. More than 5 billion pages of clinical documents are processed annually by our natural language processing engines. These are used in a variety of other applications and customer data to help inform clinical actions and create administrative efficiencies from the more than 80% of the clinical record that is essentially free text, such as physician notes and discharge summaries. Payment Integrity is among OptumInsight\u2019s strongest growing businesses. It provides compliance and cost containment solutions both prior to and following the payment of the claim. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services for data mining and predictive modeling to help over 250 national, state and local health plans and others ensure appropriate payments for services saving billions annually. Within the OptumInsight technology businesses, we apply advanced analytics and deep learning models to healthcare data covering nearly 240 million people to help optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the cost of care. Key offerings include population health, risk analytics and technology support and our research and consulting businesses provide thought leadership and expertise that reaches more than 200,000 leaders across the sector. Importantly, this business gives us at the forefront of how health systems and providers are thinking about and approaching the future and drive deeper, more integrated customer relationships across the broader Optum businesses. As we turn into the new decade, we stand our potentially transformative moment, where the application of leading 21st century technologies and machine powered analytical protocols will open up for the first time the opportunity to create ever more precise predictions of individual and system health status and risk. This will accelerate a much more focused set of interventions to improve outcomes. I have no doubt this will be an increasingly critical element of our Optum wide goal of improving clinical outcomes, quality and affordability  Now, I will turn the call over to Dirk McMahon, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. UnitedHealthcare is deeply embedded in every aspect of the health system from how to finance and pay for healthcare to engaging people and aligning incentives to promote healthier behaviors and better medicine to improve overall health at lower cost. UnitedHealthcare revenues grew by more than $10 billion to $194 billion in 2019. Operating earnings increased by 13% or $1.2 billion to $10.3 billion led by the strength in our Medicare and dual special needs businesses. As Dave noted, we are off to a strong start in Medicare Advantage this year. I would like to quickly share how we are helping to build the better health system: first, improving affordability; second, engaging and serving people; third, advancing product innovation; and fourth, serving through hands-on data-driven clinical care. Let\u2019s start with affordability because that is the gating factor for greater access to care and improving the consumer experience. One of our goals is to engage more deeply with the highest performing physicians and other clinicians to advance both quality and affordability. We know these high-performing providers achieve considerably better health outcomes, while lowering the total cost of care. Our medical cost trend over the last 5 years has strongly outperformed financial average. We are committed to driving significantly lower rates in healthcare spending growth than the industry. We see billions of additional dollars in potential savings for consumers and customers from areas such as out site of service initiatives and more deeply embedding digital tools to reduce the administrative burden for physicians. We are also using digital and physical strategies to engage consumers in new ways to simplify their experience, reduce their financial burden, and lower the total cost of care. For example, for the nearly 1.5 million people enrolled in our motion program, we offer incentives for increased individual mobility. People can earn more than $1,000 a year when they achieve defined walking frequency and intensity targets. People enrolled in motion are achieving better health at a meaningfully lower cost that is why we are expanding this program and extending product designs that rewards stronger consumer engagement and align incentives with their doctor. The third area is product innovation. We are seeing early signs of customer interest in our innovative new offerings in consumer centric products that better aligns to the unique needs and financial means of people, while engaging them in managing their health. Some examples are Harmony, a new collaboration with OptumCare providers, unites high-quality care and coverage, creating a more integrative and effective consumer experience with as much as 20% savings for our fully insured customers; All Savers offers small employers with highly flexible, affordable health plans and reduces employee out-of-pocket cost with low or no preventative and primary care coverage; NexusACO enables large employers to offer a single ACO based plan nationwide incentivizing employees to choose high-performing providers and driving better outcomes through care coordination; Bind, provides first dollar coverage and allows people to add coverage on demand for plant procedures offered by high value providers following rigorous care pathways based on best known science, while costing approximately 15% less than comparable plans. And finally, our virtual first product is attracted to the digital first generation. This new product offers zero dollar co-pay, 24/7 virtual care support at a lower price than traditional products. These are some examples of our innovation focus and health benefits and you should expect more as we redouble our efforts to engage consumers in more impactful ways and accelerate our growth in this category. Lastly, we are deploying relevant information at the point of care to improve the way care is received and managed. Point of Care Assist is a tool that puts real-time patient information at the fingertips of doctors in their EMRs providing a seamless clinical workflow experience. This improves adherence to clinical protocols, facilitates real-time authorization approvals and helps refer the patient to premium designated specialists. The utility of this tool is significant for all as doctors save time and money, consumers avoid cost surprises, and most importantly, health outcomes are improved. As we look to 2020 and beyond, there was a $900 billion untapped managed care market opportunity in health benefits, much of it in government programs where we have grown strongly and we look to serve more people more deeply across the system. Now, I will turn it over to John Rex, CFO of UnitedHealth Group.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. This morning, we reported full year revenues of $242 billion, up $15.9 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by double-digit revenue growth in Medicare and across Optum. Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of $3.90 per share grew 19% and brought full year earnings to $15.11, growth of 17%. Cash flows from operations of $18.5 billion grew 18% over 2018 to 1.3x net income better than anticipated partly due to timing factors. Our balance sheet return metrics remained strong with return on equity of almost 26%. We ended the year with a debt to capital ratio of around 40%, even with over $10 billion of deployment for business combinations and CapEx, $5.5 billion in share repurchases and a 20% dividend increase. Medical reserves developed favorably in the fourth quarter by $270 million, including a $150 million from 2019. Overall, medical costs were well managed, resulting in an 82.5% medical care ratio for full year 2019. We continue to be highly attentive to operating costs as part of our overall affordability agenda. In 2019, our operating cost ratio of 14.5% improved 50 basis points, reflecting 60 basis points of operating cost productivity and the deferral of the health insurance tax partially offset by the effect of business mix changes and continued investments in innovation, service and growth. We enter 2020 with diversified growth momentum, balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. On earnings progression, we continue to expect 47% to 48% of full year earnings per share to be realized in the first half of the year, a point to keep in mind on that quarterly progression. 2019\u2019s first quarter has one fewer work day than 2018\u2019s resulting in a higher earnings level. This year, the first quarter had a more normal mix, but then adds an extra day due to leap year. Taken together, the day count shifting has a year-over-year impact on the medical care ratio of about 80 basis points. This will result in the first quarter 2020 MCR running higher than the second quarter and earnings per share progressing accordingly, with just under 55% of the first half earnings expected to be realized in the second quarter. These impacts of course were fully contemplated in that 2020 outlook we have provided at the beginning of December. For full year 2020, we continue to expect revenues to approach $262 billion and adjusted net earnings per share in a range of $16.25 to $16.55. Consistent with our prior practices, we will more formally address these and other expectations after the first quarter. With that, I will turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. As you can tell, we are confident in the outlook for our diversified and growing enterprise for 2020 and beyond. Our businesses remained strong and well-positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering even higher levels of suicidal value. We remain committed to our mission and an intense focus on serving one person at a time at increasing levels of value, more affordable, better outcomes and improved experiences while generating strong returns for you, our shareholders. Operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions, one, per caller please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the quarter in terms of medical cost, it looks like it came in better than you expected versus the update at the Investor Day. Any color there specifically if you can expand on how you are seeing kind of Medicaid progress from a cost and risk pool rate perspective as you kind of come into 2020 that will be really helpful as well? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Hey, Justin. Good morning. Yes, I think I would point out a few things here. You are correct, it did come in just a little bit better than our guidance at the investor conference and a few things to note, first, I\u2019d call it broadly across the businesses as we continue to see the impact of the affordability initiatives that we have been very focused having traction and having impacts. So broadly across that, I think it\u2019s fair to say also that we certainly did see some continued improved in our Medicaid businesses, that\u2019s a place that we have been focused on for a while here and that was also a contributor. But broadly, I would say, across our businesses as we saw those affordability initiatives having traction.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Justin. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Yes, just it sounds like on the call today you are reaffirming your expectations around Medicare Advantage enrollment, obviously CMS has come out with their January numbers. It looks like in terms of the percentage enrolled in January, you are a little bit lighter than you were a year ago, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a fair comparison, but I wondered is there anything in the data that I don\u2019t know if you look at what they put out that is missing from your perspective? I know it shows you down in group MA and maybe you are going to pickup in group MA, but just you flush out a little further what group MA over the course of the year would anything to reassure us about your expectations around MA for this year?\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks, A.J. We are very pleased with our AEP results. And I would say that by far it\u2019s our strongest year ever in individual Medicare. We did reaffirm the guidance, but nearer to the upper end of that guidance today, so we feel pretty strongly on with respect to our overall performance. Tim Noel, can you add some color on some of the other questions?\nTim Noel: Yes, good morning A.J. Thanks for the question. And first off, some of that CMS partial AEP reporting can be a little bit misleading. And Dave said, first and foremost, we want to reiterate the confidence in our full year enrollment growth that we shared at investor conference for MA. And just to revisit that briefly, we said 500,000 to 550,000 Medicare Advantage growth in the M&R business, which includes both group and individual MA and we also said that would be up to 700,000 in MA growth, including duals lifting our community and state business. So when AEP completes, we will have grown by 370,000 in individual MA, including the duals that are in CNS and that\u2019s up 140% over last year\u2019s AEP and is our strongest performance ever in the annual enrollment period. We expect this to drive full year results about 700,000 member growth in individual MA and that\u2019s split on January net growth versus the rest of the year is roughly 50-50 and that\u2019s consistent with the historical pacing and also full year supported by the momentum that we have seen in AEP. With respect to group, you are right, group MA contracted modestly in the CMS reporting. When January all settles out, we expect that to be down about 65, but that will strengthen to flat to down 25 as the year closes out. And finally, all told, really great start to the year, strong signal of confidence for the full year and our growth guidance shared at investor conference.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, A.J. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. I think just sticking on the membership updates for 2020 and obviously you just gave some good detail on Medicare. Just interested if there is anything to call out in terms of on either the commercial business or the Medicaid business in terms of expectations on membership relative to the ranges that you had provided at Investor Day? Then also just specifically within that, just interested in how you are sort of approaching the North Carolina Medicaid situation, just given the budget situation there in terms of what you are assuming for for timing implementation of that and how manly lives you have factored in around North Carolina? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Good question, Scott. Thank you. Dirk McMahon will start and then Heather Cianfrocco can discuss Medicaid.\nDirk McMahon: Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question, Scott. So, we will be down a little bit in enrollment for 01/01/20 in both the fully insured and ASO areas. But as throughout the course of the year, we expect to gain membership in both areas that we have previously guided in December. As we look at 2020 we are going to continue with the pricing discipline that I have previously talked about as we balance enrollment growth with our margin expectations. We remain focused on delivering a unique value proposition for our customers and the consumer. Just to tell you, we are optimistic for next year, I mean in fully insured, expect strength in individual products in their middle-market, as I look at your ASO block, I look at our All Savers and I look at our middle-market as well. And with that, turn over to Heather on Medicaid.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Thanks. Yes, so good question with respect to \u2013 I will start with membership and I will talk a little bit about North Carolina. So membership for this year we do expect growth in Medicaid this year and that\u2019s coming from a couple of places, North Carolina is in our 2020 guidance right now. We have got some other things in there. We have got some increases from some markets like our Washington win last year, Texas win, recent Texas wins. We are going to see some Nebraska expansion and then we see another strong year [indiscernible] as Tim just talked about for 2020 we think we are really well positioned there with new county expansion, service area expansion and our AEP is off to a really, really strong start. We are really excited about that. Pressure is obviously North Carolina. So, it\u2019s in our 2020 membership outlook and our revenue outlook and we assume it right now to come in about midyear. We are really honored we were selected. We are ready for implementation and we are eager to start serving North Carolinians. Despite the situation there, there is strong support for the program and for managed care there. So we are continuing to monitor the implementation date. We will keep you posted on that and you will watch that as well. In the meantime, we have got \u2013 we are excited about the opportunity, it\u2019s in our outlook and we look forward to hopefully getting that on track here close to midyear as possible.\nDavid Wichmann: And just to add on to that a little bit, Scott, we won also in Kentucky, we are pleased to win obviously, that\u2019s being re-bid now, but we will hopefully prevail in the end there as well and it\u2019s a strong RFP season for Medicaid broadly. And I see the business having come around to being positioned with its turnaround just in time to compete ferociously for that business. So we are pretty bullish about the opportunity that exists in Medicaid and I think we are well positioned to grow. Thanks for the question, Scott. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nPeter Costa: Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. I\u2019d like to take it up a little bit in terms of looking at some of the longer term picture for Medicare, just couple of changes in the Medicare program and I am curious what you think of as being the biggest risks to you in terms of your business and those are paying for social determinants of health, which is something new for this year allowing ESRD patients to join next year and Medicare fee-for-service direct contracting by providers is starting. Can you talk about those three items and if they are risks to you?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. I would be happy to discuss all three of those. Tim?\nTim Noel: Yes. Yes, thanks Peter. So I think I will take ESRD first, but also I want to caution the long-term outlook especially with respect to 2021 and really any year, it\u2019s a little bit premature to get into some of the nuts and bolts of how we see the landscape shaping out. But on ESRD, we are very supportive of the change that goes into a fact that on 2021 and encouraged by the opportunity to serve more people. We are not concerned with some of the unknown elements around the reimbursement and payment idles. We will learn those details very soon. We remain confident and expecting that those models will be fair, adequate. And importantly, we believe that these people will be better served in Medicare Advantage. And also important to keep in mind, we served 40,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees with ESRD today that developed a disease post enrollment. And our focus of these members is both on prevention and also on treatment. So we are pleased to have the opportunity to expand our reach and impact with patients that have the disease at the time of enrollment. With respect to social determinants, we continue to have that be a key focus of our business consistently referring folks into insider programs where appropriate and some of the additional flexibility our apply social determinants and plan design are elements that we are leveraging in some of our demonstration projects in 2020. We are excited to learn a little bit more about this as the year progresses and look for more opportunities to do things in this area in 2021.\nDavid Wichmann: The last one was physician direct contracting fee-for-service Medicare.\nBrian Thompson: Right. Hey, Peter. Brian Thompson here. We are very encouraged by that as well. I think similar to what we have done with the bundled payment program it\u2019s a good opportunity to work on advancing traditional Medicare and we are encouraged by that thinking and creativity and look forward to participating.\nDavid Wichmann: And I might add overall, Peter, that we are bullish obviously overall on the outlook for both Medicare Advantage, but also the dual special needs marketplace as well. They are both very larger today and growing in markets. MA is clearly outperforming fee-for-service in terms of overall benefit coverages and the quality of outcomes and the returns that people are getting in terms of their overall satisfaction. And so no surprise that it is performing as well and seems to be gaining some momentum. So we look forward to continuing to compete hopefully growing at these levels, if not higher going forward. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. Question around the sort of broad space that\u2019s growing around physician enablement and I am curious it seems like there has been a lot of interest, a lot of new competitors that are kind of focused on that. I know Optum has been very early. Do you think of Optum as sort of the market leader and is this broad movement of physicians taking more risk, is this positive for UnitedHealth Group?\nAndrew Witty: Josh thanks so much for the question. It\u2019s Andrew. Yes, we absolutely see physicians very much as a central element of improving care delivery quality and cost. It was really driving OptumCare which is clearly the central part of OptumHealth. As we see physicians move toward taking more risk, we see improvements across the board in terms of resource allocation, prevention, focus, ensuring clinical outcome is maximized. We are very encouraged by that trend. This year alone we would expect about 150,000 more patients to go into our physician risk managed programs across OptumCare. We continue to see that trend accelerate. It\u2019s very much something that we then anchored the build out of the rest of our OptumHealth portfolio around. So in a sense, is that thoughtfulness around how can we then create services inside data analytics which held the position, made the best possible judgment to manage the overall risk profile of the patient. You see that then reflected in the relentless growth of the revenue per patient served across OptumHealth. That\u2019s really being driven by this shift. And so you are absolutely right, very important element for us and it essentially becomes the core around which we then envision and build our support services, our interventions and our analytics to empower the physicians to make the best possible decision on behalf of the patients. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: I might just add to that just slightly, Josh, that UnitedHealthcare is working on physician enablement as well. This is what the core of Dirk\u2019s commentary this morning was around Point of Care Assist. This is why we built and deployed the IHR and this is why we focus essentially in our investor conference around the way in which we engage both the digital and physical realms to AI enabled people to be able to operate much more effectively and serve their patients. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: We will go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Thanks. Just want to go back to Medicaid for a minute. Can you talk a little bit about, I think you mentioned that in Q4, maybe you saw some improvement on Medicaid, but can you talk about the expectation for the year, I guess in particular, I guess two things, one is the implication of redeterminations and the rate updates will get relative to that, how are the rate updates going and do you \u2013 are you modeling additional rate determinations as the year goes on? And then second just quickly going back to the North Carolina, if North Carolina got delayed into 2021, would that impact your EPS guidance or is it more towards the revenue number at this point?\nDavid Wichmann: Heather, do you want to take that question?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. So maybe I will start with that Medicaid performance. So, yes, we are pleased with Q4 results and when I said that I really mean it\u2019s marching along right within expectations with what we have really executed on our affordability agenda. We see strong partnership with our state to address what was for a period of time due to redeterminations or other under-funding issues, acquity-related under-funding. So as we look into 2020, I feel good about the progress made through all of \u201819 and particularly in the second half of \u201819 with respect to rates and with respect to affordability. And so as we come into 2020, we have got to view into our Q1 rate renewals. They are right in line with our expectations. They are up above what they were at the same time in \u201819. We have delivered on our clinical programs. We are seeing strong NPS, customer service scores and quality. So I feel good about that. As I say that, you still expect us to hit our target margin by the end of the year. So that just gives us renewed confidence in what was committed to you already, so expect our Medicaid business to continue to perform along that track and we will be hard at work on it. With respect to North Carolina, yes, I guess, I will just say, again we are monitoring it everyday right now, I am going to say that we are continuing to push and it is a big component of our opportunity in 2020 from revenue and a membership perspective. But that being said, there is a lot of other growth opportunities that we are measuring to. We didn\u2019t have Kentucky in our guidance, but we also didn\u2019t not got pushed, but we also didn\u2019t have the Massachusetts care bid that we just won. So we are going to be monitoring all those things. And right now, we are going to kind of work for midyear or close thereto implementation and we will keep you posted.\nDavid Wichmann: Kevin, Dave again, if I can just add, so if North Carolina were to get pushed to 2021, it would not affect our expectations for the year, our guidance would stay the same. It is \u2013 as it comes out of the shoot it\u2019s a relatively modest margin product, market as is often the case. So we wouldn\u2019t expect any material impact on our expectations of the year. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Could you talk a little bit about PBM margin for the quarter and interested in, I mean, the improvement there, how much of that is driven by just to make sure from the transition of the large clients and how much is other initiatives like cross sales or sourcing initiatives?\nDavid Wichmann: John Prince?\nJohn Prince: Lance thanks for the question. As you look at the fourth quarter, the margin was elevated as expected. So when we gave our guidance at Investor Day, we are expecting a operating earnings margin around 6.3%, 6.4%. So, it\u2019s exactly what we expected. Why it was elevated is exactly what you mentioned was the loss of the large client, where we lost the revenue, but we didn\u2019t really impact our operating earnings. The second driver was the supply chain strength in terms of our \u2013 continue to negotiate with pharma manufacturers as well as the supply chain to get value to pass on to our clients. And so that was the other key driver for us. As you look to 2020 guidance, you should expect our operating earnings margin to fallback to where we have guided at Investor Day with 5.1% to 5.2%, so that should be your expectation. It was more of an anomaly what happened in Q4 as expected.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Lance. Next question please.\nOperator: Yes. We will go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning. So, you reiterated guidance this morning for 2020, just want to clarify if the guidance already includes any impact from HIT repeal on midyear renewals and also the benefit from the Diplomat acquisition? And then another follow-up on the dual growth, I mean, obviously 15% to 20% is what is the implied growth which is strong and above market, but when we think about that, can you just kind of like help us think through the Part D dynamics and how that would slow through the P&L if it\u2019s going to to have any impact on OptumRx throughout the year?\nDavid Wichmann: We will have John Rex started and then shift to Tim Wicks or John Prince.\nJohn Rex: Hey, Ricky. John Rex here. So in terms of those elements you mentioned, I\u2019d say both immaterial in the scope of our company. You are correct, yes, when we guided to 2020 initially, the repeal of the HIT was the health insurance tax had not yet occurred, but I would call that immaterial to us, yes, there is some impact, but not material in terms of modest headwinds in the scheme of our company, not something that we would call out. Also in terms of the Diplomat, the pending Diplomat acquisition also, I would call that immaterial really no impact, really neutral in terms of our 2020 outlook.\nDavid Wichmann: And John Prince?\nJohn Prince: Thanks, Ricky. John Prince. In terms of the other pieces on Part D and other components, that\u2019s as expected. So I think we are not changing our guidance for 2020. What we expected in terms of Part D and Diplomat was built into our guidance and so we are comfortable with our expectations.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Ricky. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tanal: Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I guess at this stage I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the HIT repeal how we should be starting to thinking about modeling that in whether you commit to sort of at least the non-tax deductibility of it going away kind of falling to the bottom line or is it still too early? And then maybe just to your comment on OptumHealth just given the risk-taking nature of what you guys are doing, I thought it would be interesting to hear from you all how the flu impacted the economics of that business in Q4 thinking sort of revenue earnings margin? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. I will touch on the HIT and then Wyatt Decker will comment on OptumHealth. So overall, the HIT, we are as I said in the prepared remarks, we are pleased that this would go away. Obviously, it\u2019s great for seniors, families of small businesses and individual insurers as well on average for couple \u2013 senior couples $500 to $600 pretty much carries out the same for a family of four that\u2019s sponsored by a small business. And so obviously, this has strong economic impact on these families and individuals. So it\u2019s terrific to see it gets repealed. The other thing about it is it removes the excessive volatility. I am you are as fatigued with it as we are, it\u2019s in, it\u2019s out, and but more important in all of that is that, it affects the volatility of pricing in the marketplace as well. So hopefully we will see that stabilize as we get through 2020 and into 2021 as well. Just before I go to discuss 2021 and what our strategies maybe with respect to how we handle this, obviously, it\u2019s important that the tax value gets back into the hands of people. That\u2019s what it was intended to do and that\u2019s what we intend to accomplish overall. And as John already indicated, while it has a drag on earnings for 2020 we are not changing our outlook as a result of that. That is small item in the broad scheme of things. And I think we are to discuss flu with OptumHealth.\nWyatt Decker: Yes, Stephen, thank you for the question. At OptumHealth and OptumCare, we follow the usual flu modeling and we have not seen a material impact deviating from that in Q4 and we do not anticipate significant impact in Q1. As you may know, it\u2019s been a reasonably robust flu season, but it\u2019s mostly of the B strain which is not as severe. So we also have a fee-for-service MedExpress practice, which tends to offset any hit we might take on the risk side. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Wyatt. Just I want to clarify one thing that Ricky asked and I am not so sure we answered it correctly. It\u2019s really about whether or not in Diplomat, the proposed transaction is in our numbers for 2021 and \u2013 or 2020 and the answer to that is no, it would not be in there. We don\u2019t include transaction in our forecast until they closed. So that is not included in there. And as soon as it does close the quarter following we will update our forecast accordingly. This is one of the reasons why we talked about the impact of capital deployment on our growth rate and how it can advance during the year because of transactions. In this case, it will be very, very modest, but nonetheless, I just wanted to make sure we have that clarification. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So actually not to beat the Diplomat Pharmacy acquisition topic at that, but I know it\u2019s not a huge acquisition for you financially, but despite that, I do have to believe there would just almost immediately be a ton of operational synergies when folding that book of business into your existing PBM and specialty pharmacy operations, probably in reimbursement and also in pharmacy network contracts? So I guess I was hoping to hear more color around what you see is the biggest area of synergy at this stage? And then just conceptually, could this deal move the needle for UNH overall in 2021, obviously you are making it sound like probably in 2020 not much, but could it move the needle for the company overall in 2021? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: It will be nicely accretive to us. Unfortunately, it also comes with a great deal of integration costs, most of which will hit 2020 as well. And would you like to touch on that, John?\nJohn Prince: Steven it\u2019s John Prince. Just maybe touch a bit more on why we are doing the deal, because I think that\u2019s really at the core of it which was to better serve individuals that have complex diseases like oncology, immunology and specialized infusion therapy. When you look at the capabilities of Diplomat around specialty pharmacy and infusion, it fits well with the strategy of OptumRx focused on these unique populations that need better volume, helping improve their drug cost, improving their health outcomes and overall value of care and doing it in a compassionate way. So, we think it is a good fit of our two businesses that come together to better serve the key needs in the market. And so as we have talked about before strategically especially drug cost is a key focus for the future as well as polyclinics and I think that strategically fits very well. We are obviously still little ways away from closing the transaction. We are actively doing our planning for that. And we will be ready to start that as we conclude the transaction in the first quarter.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay, I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, no problem. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Newshel: Thanks. Maybe just going back to the flu, I just wanted to confirm that those earlier comments also apply to the UnitedHealthcare side as well. You have seen high outpatient activity but severity in hospitalizations just don\u2019t appear to be that high at least published yet?\nDavid Wichmann: Jeff Putnam?\nJeff Putnam: Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, on the UnitedHealthcare side similar dynamics, the flu season as you see in the CDC data started early and we are having elevated incident levels on the outpatient side, but overall severity as was mentioned is lower there and in-patient admits have been close to normal, so very modest impact in the fourth quarter.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Michael. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. You are rolling out certain initiatives and benefit design changes to your fully insured book around site of service initiatives and prior off along with preferred lab network, etcetera and it sounded like that actually benefited some \u2013 to some degree in the fourth quarter. Can you give us maybe a little bit of a sense of what proportion of the ASO book has adopted these initiatives maybe for 2020 and/or how we should think about sort of the uptake over time? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I don\u2019t think we will talk about adoption rates in the large national accounts business, but Dirk, do you want to talk a little bit about your overall efforts around containing medical costs?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. As we think about medical costs, you mentioned very effectively site of service being rolled that out to a lot more codes in November, knees and procedures like that. We are also very focused on our network negotiations to try to drive unit costs lower in many areas. As we look at our trend, two-thirds of unit costs, the network is at the start of that. We are doing a lot of work in terms of increasing consumer engagement providing with them with effective decision tools to rally in our other apps portal to other digital properties to drive the right movements and also got to thank Optum, a lot of work with our clinical models driving savings as well as payment integrity as Andrew mentioned in his remarks. So, we really have a full forward press on affordability. We think that is a primary driver of our ability to price effectively in the market and actually provide access for consumers and employers and everyone, so a lot of work on the affordability front.\nDavid Wichmann: Dirk and team at UnitedHealthcare are doing a wonderful job on affordability broadly in medical cost. Obviously, they are interested in getting healthcare to be much more affordable and the collaboration between Optum UnitedHealthcare has never been stronger in that front. Optum has really stepped in as they do with all the third-party health plans as well. It\u2019s really assist in driving this broad-based agenda across the company. We have time for two more questions. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Great. Does that mean I get to ask two questions? No.\nDavid Wichmann: Pardon me.\nGary Taylor: I was going to say, great, does that mean I get to ask two questions?\nDavid Wichmann: You can. We will answer the first one.\nGary Taylor: I will ask just my question. My one question is I do appreciate the earnings cadence commentary given the leap year, but thinking since reported MLR is such an outsized impact on the near-term stock volatility, wondering if you would be willing to give us first quarter MLR range, I mean there are a few other moving parts in the quarter besides leap year that was pretty high March seasonality with extra Monday, Tuesday and then obviously with the dilutive impact of the HIT reinstatement?\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex you, maybe just, I know that was pretty complex in terms of quarterly progression and we expected that. So John, you just want to make sure that everybody understands that well.\nJohn Rex: Sure, Gary. Good morning. Let me give you a little more color in terms of the impact that occurs as we go into that, but I described kind of some of the impacts with workdays content and how that flows. And just in terms of thinking about that, so when value different days with different medical costs, weekends versus weekdays even versus different days of the week. In terms of what I was describing there, it actually comes out to it, it\u2019s a little \u2013 it\u2019s not two days, it\u2019s more than one day, it\u2019s about 1.3 days of impact in terms of the workday content is where it fall then to when you flow into a leap year like that and that pattern, typically of course repeats. So that\u2019s kind of the element that flows into that. Then if you consider the other elements we talked about at \u2013 when we talk to our full year MCR progression and year-over-year progression, we talked about the impact of the health insurance tax of 140 basis points and that impact and then we talked about mix impacts also that occur over the course of the year. So those are really kind of the cores that are as we consider, as we consider where we would expect the medical care ratio to be lining up here as we look at the first half of the year. I hope that gives you a little extra color.\nGary Taylor: So you don\u2019t want to give us a 1Q range today?\nJohn Rex: Sorry, what\u2019s that, Gary?\nGary Taylor: You don\u2019t want to give us the first quarter MLR rate\u2026\nJohn Rex: First quarter pick. I think I kind of just described it actually pretty, pretty hopefully fairly clearly there in terms of the roll forward and how you would approach that. So if you take the components of the math that I just gave you I think that should get you to a first quarter pick.\nDavid Wichmann: So there is no change to full year guidance. John tried to layout for you our first half last half would be and then within the first half what the proportions would be as well. So you should be able to get a pretty good sense of things from all of that recognizing oftentimes things don\u2019t shoot quite that straight. So plus or minus would probably be a worthwhile range to put around whatever point estimate you come up with. Thank you very much Gary. Next question please.\nOperator: And we will go next to Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thanks for squeezing me in. Now that there is some bipartisan support for spread pricing though, can you talk about the exposure in \u201819 you said it was about 25% of the book so did that needle move for \u201820, what is the mix look like in your commercial book of spread versus pass through? And does this bill impact the value proposition that you see for OptumRx at all? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: John?\nJohn Rex: Sarah thanks for the question. As you know, we are committed to driving to a strategy around negotiating with the clients of a transparent model where more and more of our services are coming from administrative fees and value-based arrangements. Our clients decide how they want to pay for our services. So when we bid on a deal and for our client, we give them an opportunity either to pay through administrative fee or with spread or traditional. So it\u2019s the client choice. So as you look at it, we don\u2019t have a preference about where we want to go up in business model. We are in different on how a client wanted to choose it. In terms of the commercial market, the trend in the market hasn\u2019t changed in the last several years. So actually the client is not going to move one way or the other in terms of spread versus administrative fee. As you look at the Medicaid market, there has been a trend over the last three years where more and more of the state organizations and have been moving to administrative fees. So if you looked at our client base 3 years ago, majority would have been spread. If you look at it today, less than a quarter is in spread and actually we expect that to almost disappear as you look out next year or 2 years. So from us when they actually impact our financials, I won\u2019t speculate about what will happen in Washington, but we are well positioned from a business standpoint.\nDavid Wichmann: Great question, Sarah. Thank you so much. I will go ahead and close now. Thank you all for your questions. Sorry, we can\u2019t get to everyone today. As you heard this morning, we remain confident in our outlook for 2020 and beyond. Our diversified and complementary businesses are strong and well-positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering even higher levels of societal value, while generating strong returns for you, our shareholders. Thank you and this concludes today\u2019s call.\nOperator: And this does indeed conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-10-15 20:34:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Earnings Reports & SEC Filings section of the Company\u2019s Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 15, 2019, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the Company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The 325,000 dedicated people of UnitedHealth Group made measurable progress again this quarter in developing the next generation health system, aligned to achieve better health outcomes at lower costs and improved patient and care provider experiences, increasing health care value for everyone, one person at a time. In turn, we delivered strong, well-balanced revenue and earnings growth across our business. Total revenues through the first three quarters of this year grew 8% year-over-year or $13.4 billion to $181 billion, and adjusted earnings per share advanced 17% to $11.22. Operating cash flows were $12.3 billion or 1.2 times net earnings. Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum contributed strongly to these results. Based on this year\u2019s year-to-date performance, we have increased our outlook for full year 2019 adjusted earnings to a range of $14.90 to $15 per share. As always, we are focused on operating our businesses, lowering health care costs for people, advancing quality and the consumer experience, building on our strategic growth platforms, and driving innovative change and societal returns at scale, all designed to achieve the full and unique growth potential of this enterprise. We have a strong track record of thriving in fluid environments similar to the one we find ourselves in today. We are uniquely diverse with significant experience and weight in every aspect of health care, Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial coverages, in both at risk and self-funded forms with considerable presence in health care services including high-value health care delivery at emerging scale, all across the United States. These are substantial, fast-growing businesses, not new initiatives. This diversity, combined with a conscious adaptability orientation, allows us to consistently perform for the people we serve, and for you, our investors, through a wide and ever-changing spectrum of environmental conditions. Our growth agenda is purpose built to align with the changes necessary to develop the next generation, more modern and effective health system. We are reinventing health care delivery, now directly serving 25 million patients in 35 local U.S. markets and in South America; transforming pharmacy care services, driving transparent, digitally enabled, high-quality plan designs at lower costs with more consumer responsive point-of-sale discounts, saving nearly $2,000 per person per year on average. Accelerating digital, our consumer digital platform, serving nearly 20% of the U.S. population by January 2020, is being extended to include proprietary, deeply personalized next best action recommendations within portable medical records maintained real-time for nearly 50 million Americans and their doctors. Engagement strategies and incentives around this data hold the potential to achieve double-digit cost of care reductions. And advancing consumer-centric benefits. Our Bind, NexusACO, Allsavers and Harmony products are beginning to gain considerable traction in the commercial markets this fall. And our Medicare Advantage and Dual offerings are well-positioned to again drive distinctive growth from the differentiated value we deliver to people. Our relentless focus on quality, experiences and costs is increasingly apparent. Our NPS levels have never been higher; we just completed our regular three-year Medicare audit with exceptional results; expected members in 4 Stars or greater plans for 2021 payment year are at an all-time high of 84% at UHC and a consistently strong 92% at Optum. Every one of our Medicaid states are referenceable. Our overall per capita health care cost trends have averaged well below 4% for the past half decade, even as we\u2019ve expanded MA benefits, and our operating costs continue to come in line, preserving consumer premiums for medical care. I could go on. You should get a sense today that our business is progressing across multiple dimensions with many of our growth and performance efforts beginning to fall in place. Higher quality, better outcomes and experiences, lower costs, building the next generation health system in a socially conscious way, these have been and will continue to be the consistent themes for our enterprise, an enterprise built for growth. So, with confidence, I turn you to our exceptional business leaders for updates on our businesses and financial results and expectations, starting with Andrew Witty, CEO of Optum.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Dave. An aging population, increasing numbers of people with multiple chronic conditions, and the rise of increasingly costly therapies, most notably specialty medicines and gene therapy are all challenges to achieving a simpler, more cost-effective health system. Optum is addressing these areas through applied technologies, distinctive clinical expertise and an intense focus on improving the consumer and physician experience, all underpinned by an unparalleled set of assets, with far-reaching data transformed into information by powerful analytic tools and deployed throughout the health system. We\u2019re making the system more transparent and simpler while bringing our core capabilities even more closely together to provide more fully integrated solutions and advance higher quality outcomes at a lower cost. OptumRx is treating patients holistically, aligning pharmacy, medical and behavioral health needs using data and evidence-based protocols to enable end-to-end management of care. This approach has been honed over several years now and is making a meaningful difference for patients and customers. This includes deepening our capacity to serve people who need high-cost specialty drugs, including convenient, higher-quality and less costly access to specialty pharmaceuticals through direct delivery of infusion services. The number of patients we support with these services has more than doubled to 60,000 over the last five years and we expect this number to more than triple over the next five years. Realized savings are 30% to 50% per infusion versus an inpatient setting, with comparable quality. OptumInsight continues to fuel a rapid technology and information innovation agenda across both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Its increasingly diverse spectrum of best-in-industry capabilities are driving strong growth in backlog for an expanding client list of health systems, governments, health plans and other health system participants with broader solutions sets, such as those offered in the John Muir Health announcement last quarter. Business momentum is accelerating as these solutions extend the positive impact OptumInsight is having on the cost and quality of the care experience. But, today, I\u2019d like to focus on how OptumCare, the largest part of OptumHealth is positively impacting the health system. OptumCare works to form modern local health systems that are physician-led, technology-enabled and integrated to deliver the lowest total cost of care, with exceptional outcomes and a better patient and physician experience. We empower primary care doctors with insights and information by focusing on proactive, preventative medicine. We surround them with select high-performing specialists and provide in-home and outpatient services to care for people at the optimal site of service. We understand care delivery is an intensely local experience. So, I\u2019d like to provide a few examples of how OptumCare and our full range of capabilities are developing and delivering at a local level. Southern Nevada is among our most developed geographies and continues to grow rapidly. Our physician base there has expanded by nearly 60% just since 2016. Our doctors are fully supported by Optum data, analytics, technology and a single medical record, allowing them to deliver exceptional care to more than 300,000 people, 85% of whom are in capitation arrangements. In the commercial population, our total cost of care is more than 10% lower than the competition. In Medicare Advantage nearly all plans are 4-Star with cost trends averaging well less than 1% per year over the last two years and with HEDIS quality measurements 20% better than peers. In Southern California, we are creating the most comprehensive accountable care platform in the region, now serving 1.5 million people through value-based arrangements, nearly triple the 2016 levels. Our OptumCare platform in Southern California serves 30 payers through a network of aligned physicians, 100 clinics and our nearly 30 ambulatory surgery centers. With our geographic presence and integrated open system of care, we recently co-created with UnitedHealthcare a distinctive product called Harmony that provides a seamless experience by uniting care and coverage, achieving 20% savings for people as compared to UnitedHealthcare\u2019s comparable coverage offerings. In Texas, our nationally recognized physician groups continue to deliver superior outcomes for patients, care providers and benefit sponsors. This has enabled us to expand across the state from a single geography in San Antonio to communities like Dallas, Austin and Houston. In 2020, we expect to serve more than 500,000 people in value-based care relationships across Texas, up from 200,000 in 2016. This advanced clinical model is producing a Medicare Advantage medical trend that runs at one-half the national average. Finally, in New Jersey, a newer stage region, we are taking major steps forward to augment and align with other OptumCare assets, integrating MedExpress urgent care centers and partnering our ambulatory surgery centers to create a more seamless experience for patients. Our advanced offerings deliver more than 15% lower total cost of care than peers in the commercial market and approximately 10% in Medicaid. Since 2016 our OptumCare practice in New Jersey has grown its physician base by 60% and the number of consumers served has increased by 70%. To summarize, we are growing our physician base, applying data analytics and technologies, advancing collaboration, driving distinctive quality, and serving diverse payers to improve health outcomes at lower costs. We will further expand and deepen our local presence, aligning and integrating our capabilities across OptumCare as well as Optum more broadly in areas, including specialty pharmacy, behavioral health services and community-based pharmacy dispensaries. All this to improve clinical quality, consumer and physician experiences and cost structures in a growing number of OptumCare regions, leading to growth and earnings performance. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dirk McMahon, CEO of UnitedHealthcare.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. UnitedHealthcare and Optum share a vision for creating a better health system, one that delivers greater value to consumers, customers and society as a whole. Fulfilling that mission depends significantly on making health care more affordable. Lowering costs is the pivotal element to improving and sustaining access, even as we enhance quality. We have a multi-faceted agenda to do this. Let me share with you a few focus areas from UnitedHealthcare\u2019s perspective. There is considerable excess spending on care delivered in sub-optimal, high-cost settings that can and should be provided in higher-quality, consumer-responsive, and more cost-effective sites. In our commercial business alone we see opportunity to shift well more than 20% of our medical spend to these more effective sites. For example, there is significant opportunity for more hip and knee replacement procedures to be performed in ambulatory centers, with those settings often having a 50% cost advantage over traditional settings and with fully comparable, if not better, safety and quality. Similarly, we are better optimizing the settings for delivery of imaging procedures and we\u2019re beginning to provide significant savings by enabling specialty drugs to be administered through alternate sites. We are rapidly expanding this approach to additional high-cost services that would be part of our site of service efforts by the end of this year. We expect these efforts to deliver $0.5 billion in savings in 2020 for our customers. The data on affordability and access is also clear with respect to high-performing physicians and health systems. We know high-performing providers as measured by health outcomes and adherence to scientific, evidence-based medicine provide care for people at 7% lower total costs. Across our businesses, this is a $9 billion annual savings opportunity. Our product and network designs increasingly emphasize these high-performing care providers who share philosophies on improving quality and the patient experience, while reducing the total cost of care. Using the individual health record and advanced referral capabilities as our foundation, we are designing products and aligning incentives to include full clinical and financial accountability with care providers who are capable of performing to both upside and downside measures. Innovative new products, like Harmony, which Andrew mentioned earlier, is a good example. There is also significant potential to better transition patients from acute to post-acute care settings. Over the past year, we\u2019ve deployed new technology that analyzes millions of data points to help physicians arrive at the specific care setting that\u2019s optimal for an individual\u2019s unique circumstance. On average, we realize nearly a 10% reduction in unnecessary readmissions by selecting the most appropriate clinical setting for the unique needs of the patient. And as always, we are focused on reducing the cost of administering health care and ensuring system integrity. Technology is enabling these efforts. We\u2019re investing in digital tools to support doctors, reducing their administrative burden while improving efficiency and affordability across the system. For example, care provider phone calls to us have decreased nearly 10% this year, thanks to these digital investments. Our productivity and automation efforts this year and next should save us over $1 billion. And our fraud, waste and abuse program should save customers more than $1 billion next year as well. As you can tell, we are highly focused on improving the value we deliver for people and our clients by modernizing our approaches and reducing the total cost of care while providing greater access to high-quality care through new, more innovative products and services. These actions all lead to greater value for people and growth of our businesses. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to John Rex, CFO of UnitedHealth Group.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group revenues grew 7% and operating earnings grew 9%, the latter led by the Optum businesses. We saw broad strength across most of the enterprise, and the opportunities to grow and serve more people at ever higher levels of value continue to expand. At UnitedHealthcare, revenue growth was led by Medicare & Retirement, with seniors served in Medicare Advantage increasing by 315,000 over last year, nearly 450,000 when dually eligible members are added. UnitedHealthcare revenue growth of 5% was impacted by the health insurance tax deferral and withdrawal from the Iowa Medicaid program. Medical costs remain well-controlled. We now see 2019 commercial trend running in the lower half of the range we originally outlined late last year. Cost trends across our government programs remain in the low single digits. The financial performance of our Medicaid business continues to improve, while the pacing is slower than originally anticipated, as we work closely with our state partners to ensure Medicaid rates are set to sustainable levels. We are deeply committed to these programs, as they are the most effective way to provide access to quality care for millions of Americans, importantly those most in need. We expect our performance to continue to steadily improve in 2020. The Optum businesses are performing at high levels and remain uniquely positioned to improve overall health system performance. Each delivered double-digit earnings growth in the third quarter. OptumHealth revenue per consumer served grew 30% as the scope and intensity of services provided increased, this largely due to the continued development of OptumCare. OptumInsight backlog grew 21% to $19 billion, led by growth in operations and technology, revenue cycle management, and payer services. At OptumRx, adjusted scripts grew 4% excluding the transition of a single large account. OptumRx continues to achieve strong gains across multiple markets, as its value proposition resonates with customers. Operating cash flows remain strong at $12.3 billion through the first nine months of this year or 1.2 times net earnings. And our balance sheet remains well-positioned for continued capital deployment to the businesses and return of capital to shareholders, with a market leading dividend. Our strong year-to-date results lead us to raise our full year 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings to a range of $14.90 to $15 per share, at the mid-point an increase of $0.40 per share from the initial outlook we provided late last year. In summary, our diversified growth, focus on cost management and strategic capital allocation are combining to produce another strong year of performance. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. Standing back, you perhaps sense that the things coming into place across Optum, UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group translate into real and sustaining value to consumers and customers and ultimately distinguished growth for our business and returns for shareholders. As you know, at this time of the year, we typically offer some early thoughts on performance for the coming year. We are approaching 2020 with optimism, particularly given the enterprise-wide commitment to translate the value of this evolving, next generation health system into market growth in tangible ways. Understandably your attention has also begun to shift to next year. And we have observed that a handful of the more recently updated estimates are now starting to center on the more typical prudent posture we would expect, at this distance, as a starting point for core adjusted earnings per share performance, this nearer to the lower end of our 13% to 16% long-term performance we remain committed to achieving. To this starting point, we apply the impact of the health insurance tax, which for us should approximate $0.50 per share year-over-year, $0.35 of this attributed to in-year 2020. And in keeping with our normal practice, we exclude the accretive impact of additional strategic capital allocation, primarily M&A, over the balance of 2019 and into 2020. As is custom, we will provide a detailed look at 2020 performance expectations at our December 3 investor conference and as always, endeavor to outperform as we progress through 2020. We remain committed to growing our business and developing the next generation, patient-centric health system, with an aim towards driving considerable societal returns and distinguished growth. That\u2019s how our business operates and will continue to operate every day. Operator, let's open it up for questions. One question per caller please, so we can get to as many as possible. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate your early commentary on 2020. So, I wanted to follow up there. You talked about being at the lower end of the 13% to 16% growth rates that you target over the long-term ex the half. Can you share with us kind of what the key drivers of that are and why you think close -- the starting point closer to the low end is where we should target, given what looks like pretty significant momentum going into 2020?\nDavid Wichmann: Fair question, Justin. I appreciate it. I think, as you know, our posture, at this time of the year and at this distance from 2020, tends to be more conservative. And, as you know, we also at this time try to avoid giving specific guidance on the call. So, what we're really trying to do is give a pathway for a consensus to form relative to our own views. And as suggested, we think it's a reasonable and prudent position at this distance to censor your initial expectations of core operating performance, if I may use that word, near to the lower end of our long-term 13% to 16% growth rate, and then apply the HIT where we've provided a point estimate of $0.50 year-over-year $0.35 attributed to 2020. And then, I'd be sure when you -- then to put a range around that something like plus or minus $0.15 or so. That's the way that we would form and what you would likely expect us to come out with in December. All these expectations are without the deployment of strategic capital, additional strategic capital through the balance of 2019 and into 2020. So, the things that we've done, the transactions like an Equian as an example have been fully considered as we provide this guidance. But as you know, we're persistently putting together assets in the marketplace to drive solutions, to drive better results for people on the cost, quality and patient experience standpoint. So, those are the platforms that we will continue to develop the four or five or so that I referenced in my prepared remarks. In terms of headwinds for us. As we look at, we're always deeply respectful of medical costs. Also, the sufficiency of government funding, particularly in the Medicaid population -- Medicaid markets. In particular, as that continues to expand, it becomes even a larger line item on the budgets of individual states. And so, it's something that needs to be persistently managed and we need to make sure is adequately set. The HIT of course is coming back or the health insurance tax, which is unfortunate, given that healthcare already costs too much and be adding this burden on top of all that. But it obviously comes back and we tried to size that for you as well. And then, I'd say this thing that you may miss in all of this is the pacing of investments. And things like NPS, which we\u2019ve shown good progress in growth. The development and release of products and building new platforms is expensive. We have a lot of startup costs for our OptumCare businesses. They start as breakeven; we drive them into losses by expanding -- reducing panel size and expanding the resources available so that these become risk-bearing entities over time. And then, the new business platforms, as I discussed, like Bind and et cetera. So, those are the kinds of things that in particular that maybe cause a little bit of a difference between what you might have felt in terms of momentum and the -- where we're at. And these are just investments like we've said in each of the last two years and the decade before that that this Company persistently makes in order to drive that kind of a 13% to 16% long-term growth rate over time. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. Question is just on the MA competitive environment for 2020, and now that the landscape data has been released. And so, if you can talk about how you feel about your relative competitive positioning, and then also whether you feel like the overall pricing environment is getting more competitive in the Medicare Advantage market for next year? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I think, we're pretty bullish on it, Scott. But, I\u2019ll let Brian Thompson discuss this.\nBrian Thompson: Hi, Scott. Brian Thompson here. Thanks for the question. I would say that we're very pleased with our offerings and how the market is shaping up for 2020. I will say our first goal each and every year is to make sure that we don't disrupt the benefits and coverage that our seniors have come to expect, regardless of the headwinds that we have to face in particular, the return of the tax year in 2020. I'd say that we\u2019ve not only accomplished that, but I'd also say that in many respects, we\u2019ve strengthened the benefits and the value that we will offer in 2020. And the feedback from the broker community has been very positive. We like how our offerings are stocking up in the marketplace and we\u2019re optimistic about what seniors will see as they begin their annual enrollment as early as this morning. So, looking forward again, very optimistic about the marketplace and our position in it for UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage offerings in 2020.\nOperator: Next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nDave Windley: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Shifting to commercial. Dave, in your opening remarks, you commented about several product areas that were gaining traction in commercial this fall. The enrollment number in the quarter was pretty positive. I wondered if those were related, and if you can elaborate a little bit on that traction.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. Kind of two unrelated thoughts. I\u2019ll let Dirk respond to the latter. But as it relates to the former, we're seeing Bind gain considerable traction in the market. And I think, it should be a nice contributor to us for 2020 and beyond. I think that product feature, which is on-demand health care is beginning to resonate more effectively with the marketplace overall. Then, our NexusACO offerings is something we've had for a while. But, as is the case of ACOs, they\u2019ve had to be [stripped] [ph] down over time to make those performance-based networks more effective. And so, that is starting to gain nice traction. And we had a nice win here this fall with respect to that. Dirk, do you want to touch on\u2026?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Our fully insured gain in the quarter was largely, because of our M&A efforts. If you look organically, we're basically flat quarter-over-quarter. In the ASO space, we had a nice quarter, we grew 140,000 members. So, we\u2019re positive on that for the quarter. As we look in 2020, going back to fully insured, we're going to continue to balance enrollment growth and our margin expectations to retain the groups and attract long-term business that produce sustainable business for us. So, we're pretty bullish on what happened in the quarter from enrollment perspective.\nDavid Wichmann: The only thing I might add to that, David just so you have it is that we started out of gates pretty slow on the full risk business in the commercial markets, both in the employer and the individual. And the team\u2019s done a nice job of moderating that off throughout the year. And we've seen some progress to that extent. And we just have -- we have more work to do to continue to grow that part of the business. But, we're pleased with the moderation that's occurred and look forward to getting it to grow.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nPeter Costa: Hi. Please clarify if my math is wrong. But, my question is, if I take 13% growth off of the 14.95 sort of midpoint, maybe reduce that 14.95 by I guess $0.15 would be the amount that you're saying is tailwind from the HIT this year. So, I\u2019d say start at 14.80, grow by 13% and then subtract the $0.35 for next year from the HIT itself. That gives I guess you a midpoint of 16.37 for next year. And so, that's a $1.42 of improved earnings. How much of that $1.42 if my math was correct is dependent on the Medicaid business improvement?\nDavid Wichmann: I don't know that we'll comment specifically on that. The only thing I would add to the math, which if I'm following it is that I would put a range around that, which is -- would be classic for us to put a typical range around the math. Medicaid is making progress, made progress in the back half of 2018, is making progress, nice progress in 2019, not just financially, but all of the -- what I would characterize as the quality elements of it have firmed up and improved quite a bit. And I'd say, the elements around networks and cost containments and things of that nature have -- they made progress on that as well. And we would expect it to continue to make progress into next year as well. But, we expect contributions from all of our businesses. You'll see a healthy dose of that coming from Optum, which continues to generate a lot of momentum and will drag that into 2020 as well. And you'll see it across the UnitedHealthcare businesses broadly as well. And we'll be pleased to offer additional guidance on that and in good detail when we have our investor conference on December 3rd in New York City.\nOperator: The next question is for Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Borsch: Maybe if I could just continue on that. I realize you're not saying very much on 2020 and you want to keep it that way. But just to understand, when you talk about M&A being excluded, the accretion from M&A being excluded from where you would start out for 2020, is that -- are you pointing to a future source of additional earnings that you would, in the normal course of what you do, expect to get or is that something that's coming off of what you've already done for this year?\nDavid Wichmann: I would never say any expectations around earnings related to M&A that\u2019s either unannounced or not closed. So, that is really what we're trying to communicate there. It would be the accretion or if for whatever reason and we have done dilutive transactions as well that set foundations for us to have long-term growth. It might include that as well. But, what you've typically seen from the Company is this generates about two-thirds of its earnings profile from organic means and the other third through the deployment of capital. That's been pretty consistent for us for at least the two decades that I've been here. Kind of a hallmark of the Company in the way in which it thinks about assembling capabilities and market presence, so that it can better serve people. So, those are the -- that's really what we're trying to signal there is -- that this time last year or maybe at our investor conference last year, we gave an original range of guidance, which is $0.40 less than the revised guidance we just gave you today. Part of that was just because of stronger performance on the organic front. But another part of that was because of the deployment of capital. So, what is typical for us is to set reasonable expectations at this level, more prudent ones, and then to continue to execute. And as situations arise, raise our guidance going forward.\nMatthew Borsch: If I could ask just one follow-up on that. You normally also start out with a range, and it does include some level of assumed share repurchases. So, there is typically some allocation of capital that you start off with, unless your methodology is changing.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. You can assume that the range at which you get to for core operating performance would include a normal dose or allocation of share repurchase capital, as well as a dividend and the number of other things that we utilize our capital for.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning, here with Mr. Percher as well. Our question is around the President's executive order a couple of weeks ago around mostly Medicare, but specifically interested in your views around potential changes to Medicare Advantage with the opportunity to provide even more additional supplemental benefits. And then there were some conversation around allowing seniors to participate in the savings in the program. It sounded like that was centered on the rebate. So, I'm just curious in your perspectives on the evolution of Medicare Advantage, what you guys are positioning for in the future and sort of how you think that executive order will impact theoretically 2021 and beyond?\nDavid Wichmann: Maybe I'll start and then ask Brian Thompson to carry on, if I don't -- if I leave him any oxygen. First of all, Medicare Advantage is a very strong performing product, at least for us. It's a product that delivers cost savings to seniors and closes essential gaps that they would otherwise have on original Medicare. And at least for us, we are -- our Medicare Advantage product reduces the Part A, B benefit cost by 25% or so, and even more so when you connect UnitedHealthcare to an OptumCare enterprise where the higher performing ones reduce it by as much as 35%. So, there is a very strong value proposition. And what I hope is inherent in the executive order is continuing to throw confidence behind that high-performing product, which serves 22 million seniors today in a very strong way. The other thing I'd say about it is that our NPS is -- continues to grow in that category. And so, I think seniors are very pleased with the product. Did I leave you anything, Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. Again, I think, just echoing what Dave said, we're really pleased with what we heard in the executive order, some of the elements inside that or what we've been advocating for to make the program even stronger for the seniors in America today. Flexibility around product design for specific conditions, the use of incentives to drive better adherence and better health and certainly just promoting MA and driving better education and awareness for the benefits that it can provide, all were inside that executive order. So, we're certainly encouraged by not only the popularity of the program today but the sentiments that would suggest momentum going forward. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning. I was just hoping to get some early progress on the DMG integration and also your thoughts around its ability to be accretive to 2020? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Great. Thank you very much for the question. Yes, we're very pleased with OptumHealth to be creating the nation's leading value-based patient centric medical system. The close of DMG in June was an exciting event for us. And the ongoing integration, both culturally and bringing our tools and services to the operations of DaVita Medical Group have gone quite well so far. So, we're quite optimistic and positive about the overall impact of DMG to OptumHealth and Optum in 2020. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: That's Dr. Wyatt Decker for those of you don't know. Thank you. Next question, please?\nOperator: And we'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Could you talk a little bit about medical costs in the quarter? And I was interested in, what was turning out a little better than expected in the commercial trends and basically how Medicaid was performing on an MLR basis and things like reverification?\nJohn Rex: So, as you know, we don't go into the details of the individual businesses within UnitedHealthcare. But, Jeff, do you want to give some color on -- Jeff Putnam, CFO of UnitedHealthcare, do you want to give us some color on what's going on?\nJeff Putnam: Yes. Thanks for the question. As we mentioned, we continue to see costs very well controlled and cost trend consistent with expectations now as John noted in the lower half of the 6% range, plus or minus 50 basis points, and as we also noted, government business is tracking well in the low single digits. Unit costs continue to be the largest driver. And when you look at it by category, all the categories we typically talk about are still in our ranges, but outpatient and physician are a little bit lower than our initial projections. Inpatient remains consistent with our projections that we continue to see now decade-long trend of flat to declining bed days and admissions.\nDavid Wichmann: We're pretty pleased with our performance on managing medical costs. As you know, we have a lot -- we as an industry and we UnitedHealth Group, have a lot of work to do to bring these down to even more affordable levels. Thank you. Next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could just comment on the 2020 sort of competitive dynamics in the commercial markets, thinking both group risk as well as ASO, and maybe any early expectations for member growth or your disposition as you approach the selling season for both those sides of the business. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Dirk McMahon, CEO of UnitedHealthcare?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. So, I'll start with ASO. As I mentioned, we had a good quarter in the third quarter with 140,000 members worth of growth. As we look into 2020, we had a few national account losses. We actually had to defend more for one 1, 1, 20 than we did in prior years. We don't expect those losses to have any material impact on earnings. But, as we look into 2021, we're already into the midst of that selling season. We've already had a big win, and the pipeline is shaping up nicely. On the fully insured products, what we see in the marketplace is, it's typically competitive environment, some pockets more competitive than others, but we continue to be very respectful of our trend, we will stick to our longstanding disciplines of pricing to our forward cost and we think we have competitive products across the Board, and we're looking forward to the selling season and the upcoming buying season for 1, 1 for fully insured.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Good morning. Question is focused on OptumRx margins of 5.2. I think exceeded expectations that you set up in when you guided back in 2018. So, what drove the margin offset and the performance this quarter? And as we think about 2020, considering the new business that you're bringing on board, how should we think about that margin trajectory for next year?\nDavid Wichmann: Good question, Ricky. John Prince, CEO of OptumRx?\nJohn Prince: Good morning, Ricky. John Prince. Thank you for the question. In terms of the margin, we're comfortable with our expectations sort of short-term and our long-term guidance. As you know, OptumRx is a portfolio of pharmacy care services businesses. So, in addition to our benefit management, we also have a platform of infusion and community-based pharmacies like Genoa, specialty, e-commerce, et cetera. As those businesses continue to grow, that's driving our margin mix. So, that is probably the biggest change, and what affects our margin over time is the mix of our underlying services that we're providing. We're also investing in our portfolio that are experiencing significant growth. We've shown significant growth in all of our platforms in the services side, especially in the specialty business and infusion. So, I think we're setting up pretty well in terms of hitting our expectations on margin. And then, the deals that we've won, we've been very successful in the selling piece for 2020. That does not affect our long-term guidance for margin.\nOperator: We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Dave, I think at the beginning, you talked about your digital platform here. And I think you mentioned something like you think you can deliver double-digit cost reductions, and later you guys mentioned seeing a $1 billion in productivity savings from digital efforts. Is that something that you've been able to market to potential clients for 2020 or is that something you're talking about that's going to be rolling on and how much of that would you expect to deliver declines versus we could expect to fall to the bottom line? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Andrew Witty, CEO of Optum?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Charles, thanks very much for the question. So, digital is clearly a significant element of the mix that we're putting together. We\u2019re very much convinced that we need to make sure that we've gotten integrated healthcare offering both physically, obviously, centered around OptumCare and the ambulatory assets of OptumRx, but then really empowered by digital. If you look at Rally, it\u2019s one example; it\u2019s one of our main platforms. We've seen some significant wins during the second half of this year in business outside of the UHG Group. We now see that platform been available to about one in five Americans overall on the same significant uplift, particularly in areas like Rally Advantage where since the beginning of this year, we've had nearly 400,000 new unique users come on to that platform actively using it. So, it's a big area for us. I'd say we're still in the early days though, but with full potential of digital combining together with the rest of our portfolio of services, and we're very optimistic about it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. We've been running the math on the Medicaid enrollment, and if we take out the contract updates, it looks like the impact of the industry-wide trend of shrinkage of state eligible roles had a very minimal impact sequentially. So, I'm wondering if you think that that swooning process is over. And can you update us on the discussions with states to adjust rates for the impact on acuity mix from that roles coming, any progress there, either retroactive or forward given more close to the rate setting season for a handful of states?\nDavid Wichmann: A great question, Sarah. Heather Cianfrocco, CEO of Community & State?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Thanks Sarah for the question. So, we've been monitoring eligibility verification as well. And what I would say to you is, it really varies by market. It's so dependent upon this state specific enrollment process. So, it's been a factor in a membership change, sort of in the tail end of \u201818 and for \u201819 from us. But you are right to the extent that it's variable and we see in some states it's leveled off and then we see some that on as they update and become sort of up to date with their enrollment process is that we see that level off or even some of the membership come back in certain markets. So it's a factor for us. I think, to your point, what's important is, one, we work with our states to make sure we understand the enrollment processes that it's smooth for our members and that they're aware of their opportunities and the enrollment process; the two that we forecasted and we considered it in our investments in our membership forecast; and the three that the rate of the -- that the state rates adjust for the acuity, and we're seeing that. So we see that in these states. We have very real time conversations and the states look at the acuity. So, sometimes it may be a timing issue, but we see rates reflective of the acuity of the population based on their reverification.\nDavid Wichmann: Next question, please?\nOperator: Next is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Hey. Thanks. Maybe a little bit of a follow-up to that question. I guess, when do you think that the Medicaid business is going to become a growth business -- top-line growth business for you guys again? Obviously, you've exited a few states and the redetermination that you're talking about going on. But, is this something that we can expect to see start growing again as we get to the back half of 2020 or is this a 2021 type dynamic?\nDavid Wichmann: Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. Thanks. Yes. Thanks for the question. So, as Dave mentioned in our discussion, in our opening comments, we continue to make progress in Medicaid. And I'm pleased to say we're making a lot of progress in Medicaid. But, as he stated, the pace is not as we would expect, and we're still not where [Technical Difficulty]. That being said, we've had a lot of improvement in our quality, a lot of the markets we talked to you about last year, we've seen better rates in those markets. We're seeing in troubled spots with respect to rate discussions from the previous year, we are seeing improvement there, and we are seeing strong growth in our decent population as well as high quality scores. So, I feel really good about where the -- how the business is improving and the progress made to date. And all the while, we're continuing to bring value to our states with strong performance and innovative solutions to our members and our providers and our team is working hard to make sure we do that for full enterprise behind Medicaid. So, you'll see, as Dave mentioned, continued improvement in that through \u201819 into 2020. And I think you -- and we expect to get near our target margins as we come out of 2020. So, expect to continue to see us improving our performance and we are hard at work at it.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. If I look at OptumHealth, I guess, the margin is down year-to-year about 110 basis points. I'm assuming all or a significant part of that is the DaVita Medical Group. Can you just confirm that and comment on how -- so away from DaVita Medical Group how the rest of that business is doing, some of the key pockets of the care delivery services you provide, how they are doing?\nDavid Wichmann: Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Sure. A.J., thanks for the question. Yes. So, DMG is a significant contributor to that adjustment. Really, simply a function of them coming in at lower pre-acquisition margin, business itself is looking good, integration is looking good, and we're very optimistic as why I mentioned earlier on about the speed of which we can bring that organization in and start to improve its financial performance. As you look across the whole of that business and Dave implied this in his earlier commentary, obviously, as we\u2019re shifting more clinics toward risk, that's a significant investment, so that also has an effect as we do that. But, the consequential benefits to patients, reduction in cost of care and then the economics of Optum are very significant, as you go through that journey of capitation and you start to bring those clinics onto full stream. I'd say across the whole of OptumHealth within a very broad-based positive performance indicators from the vast majority of our businesses, I might just call out one in particular, we haven't mentioned this morning, SCA, the Surgery Center of America [Later changed by the Company to Surgical Care Affiliates]. Just if you look at Q3 over a year prior, our cardiovascular operations were up 13%, our spine procedures up 14%, and total joint procedures up 39% year-on-year. That's an example of one other element of that portfolio in a significant point of growth for us and it fits very nicely within the cluster of other services we offer in key geographies and part of our comprehensive service for patients. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, just drilling in a little bit deeper on Medicare Advantage. This question always seems to come up around this time of year. But with the CMS projecting 10% membership growth in 2020, just curious if your view is consistent with that of CMS for next year or are you still viewing the MA market growth slightly more conservatively in the 7% to 8% range, based on some of your historical comments? And also with what seems like a notable increase by UNH in your zero dollar premium offerings for 2020, my sense is you probably still are targeting to grow your MA membership a little faster than the market in 2020, which you've done obviously, you said something over the past five years or so. So, I guess, I'm just looking for any confirmatory views around that for 2020, given the overall discussion around 2020 today? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thanks for the question, Steven. As you've heard us say in the past, we suggested the industry growth rate more in that 7% to 9% range. It performed in that range again this year and the last couple of years. I hope they're right. I hope it outperforms that. I think the alignment between where CMS has and us has tightened relative to last year. I think all of the data points suggest continued optimism. And I think that's the key takeaway. And that's my continued sentiment with respect to my comments earlier. Around 2020, obviously, as the annual enrollment period shapes up here, we\u2019ll provide greater guidance. But we've had strong consistent track record of growth and I'm certainly optimistic that will continue into 2020. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about your positioning within your specialty offerings? How much of a focus is on growing that part of your business? And then, you specifically called out behavioral in the press release, but within OptumHealth. So, just hoping you could discuss that specifically and just initiatives more broadly across the specialty space? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Are you talking about specialty medications?\nRalph Giacobbe: No. Specialty services in terms of your behavioral health, dental vision, other sort of tacked on services?\nAndrew Witty: Okay, all right. So, more on the group benefits upfront. They are critical part of our overall product suite that we offer to the market. It's particularly compelling when you're in the individual and the smaller end of the market to be able to bundle those services together to be able to try their turnkey solution for, let's call it, customers from the individual up to about 500 or so lives. And they\u2019re critical element of the offering that we have as a business. We don't often talk about them, but we do offer dental vision life-based products. And I'd say that those are the most prevalent ones, light in group term relatively small policy limits overall as organization. As it relates to the behavioral health benefits and the substance use disorder elements of that too, that's part of integrated offering our larger clients look for quite often to provide an integrated medical behavioral benefit, which then also integrates pharmacy alongside all of that to be able to create a seamless experience. Some of our strongest offerings in the markets and our strongest performing plans, particularly for large employer groups are those where we provide an integrated solution set through one of our custom care delivery sites across the United States. So, they are important to our business overall.\nOperator: And we'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. This is probably one for John Prince. John, we're hearing from the broker community that rebate guarantees from PBMs to plan sponsors are coming in lower than expected with the expectation being drug pricing is going to be lower in 2020. So, I thought -- I was wondering if you could maybe give us some indication of what kind of the water line looks like where there might be risk to OptumRx earnings. And then to the degree to which you can maybe talk about how that benefits the puts and takes in other parts of the business?\nDavid Wichmann: John?\nJohn Prince: Thanks for the question, George. I\u2019d say, maybe just getting above the rebate guarantees, just talk about the market. I'd say the market is really healthy right now in terms of how we're competing in the market. Huge growth in the market in terms of number of opportunities, number of revenue opportunities in the market. So, obviously, it is a market where people are looking for value. And in that value, our value story is resonating very well. In terms of, specifically, I think, your comment is around drug inflation. And so, our clients are very focused on affordability, both from a client perspective and from a consumer perspective. Drug inflation in 2019 is materially lower than 2018. That trend has been going on for the last several years. As a result, consumers and clients benefit when prices don't increase as much. But however, prices are still increasing higher than core inflation. So overall, we're adjusting our pricing and underwriting to reflect those market trends. And so, I would just say that as the market changes, we continue to adjust our pricing to make sure that we're delivering value for our clients and consumers. So, overall, our clients have been experiencing low single-digit trend for the last several years, which drives value back to their consumers.\nOperator: And next will be Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Willoughby: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up question on the PBM space. I guess, a slight two parter. First, is the Cigna business in the PBM fully transitioned over now. And then, could you also just provide any color on how the OptumRx business looks for 2020?\nDavid Wichmann: I don't know that we\u2019ll address the second question. We\u2019ll handle that in depth at the investor conference. But, Cigna transition, John?\nJohn Prince: Sure. Thanks for the question. John Prince again. That transition is happening over phases. The first phase happened in the third quarter and the rest of it will happen through the balance of 2020. So, that first phase impacted our revenue and scripts in the quarter as you can see with that. It doesn't have any impact on operating earnings overall. I'd say the transition is going well. We continue to execute for the client. And we'll update our perspective in 2020 at Investor Day.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. I had a question about a couple of public policy changes and just your thoughts on those. The first would just be the health reimbursement accounting rules for 2020. Do you anticipate shift from small group to individual either near-term or long-term and how are you positioned for that given your footprint pullback in the individual market? And the second would just be public charge rule. I know we had an injunction issued last week, but absent that, there is estimates of 200,000 to 4 million people potentially coming off Medicaid, and if you'd want to venture a thought on what that impact might be? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I'm not so sure we're capable of projecting the latter. All I would say is that we're deeply focused on delivering value to our customers and the healthcare system broadly while advancing solutions to reduce healthcare costs and improve quality outcomes and healthcare experiences. And as it relates to rules and evolutions of those rules, we comply with those rules and regulations, and obviously to the extent that they have implications on our business, they will have so. In that case, given the size of what you're talking about in our overall presence, I wouldn't expect it to have a material impact on the Company's overall performance and/or its expectations around growth. So that's the health reimbursement. And the other item was -- what was that? I'm sorry that was the charge rule. The other one was the HRA and what the implications are of the HRA on the migration from group-based work to individual. So, I think, first of all, we're supportive of the expansion of the HRA and the ways in which they're used broadly. We think that offering a wider set of affordable options for consumers in America is essential and we much prefer the state-based designs over the higher cost exchange based offerings that are out there today. These will simply provide a greater set of options to people and seemingly a more affordable set overall. As these things go, they -- I suspect that there may be some migration towards more individual offerings. I wouldn't suggest that that would be prevalent, but to the extent that there are, I think, our Company is well-positioned to be able to offer affordable coverages for people in the commercial individual space. And that's part of the reason why we've spent so much effort over the course of the last 18 months really fortifying our offerings as well as ensuring that the distribution systems are effectively aligned to be able to drive growth and value for the people we serve.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJohn Ransom: Hi. Good morning. More of a bigger picture question. When I look at drug costs being well under control, down maybe under 1%, hospital base flat, just millions of point solutions popping out for every healthcare spend category you can think of. I struggle to connect all those dots to help trend -- cost trends still being 6%, which is as you know 3x CPI. So, in your mind -- and then, you guys doing dozen things in local markets to push risk downstream and that sort of thing. So, what will it take to get the step function trend down say a couple of hundred basis points beyond all the good work that you've already done? I am just struggling why so persistently high. And the Kaiser survey and the political landscape is pointing to this being kind of a bigger and bigger problem, especially with the rise and high co-pay plans. So, is there a horizon where cost shutdown down or are we just stuck at 5%-6% forever more, no matter what we do?\nDavid Wichmann: I think, it's starting shift down, John. And obviously, the narrative that we constructed for today was really all about how we're bringing the strength and power of Optum and UnitedHealthcare to create exactly that shift. And I think we're seeing some decent progress overall, but there is more work to be done. Andrew, do you want to comment on\u2026?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Thanks very much, Dave. And John, thanks for the -- a good question. I'm just going to pick out one detail from the question you asked and then kind of lift up a slightly broader perspective of I think perhaps how Optum can drive the improvement you're looking for. So, you're quite right, and John Prince mentioned today that drug price inflation is decelerating year-on-year. But, what you have to look at is the cost of new drugs being introduced. Drug price inflation is only comparing the price of an existing drug this year versus last year but it\u2019s not addressing the very high cost of new specialty drugs, gene therapies and those sorts of products coming into the market. So, if you look at the overall average cost of pharmaceutical deployed, I think, the price -- I think, you'll will find the price mix is nowhere near reflected in the decelerating inflation curve. That really speaks to a continued need for focus on managing the appropriate utilization of those types of medicines. They are super exciting for patients, but we need to make sure that we modernize as a system our ability to procure effectively on behalf of our customers and patients. Just one example of why you can get confusing signals when you look at some of this data. If I just step back from an Optum perspective, what we're excited about and tried to share in the prepared comments at the beginning of the call is we're now beginning to see the coming together of years of preparation and work in various models within the Optum organization. I gave three or four OptumCare examples where we have now seen material reductions in cost compared to previous date. Our goal now is, first of all, to spread that activity across the broader network of Optum, nationally; and secondly, to further deepen the contact, the cost reducing impact by bringing together the various assets that we have in several cities across the U.S. We have tens of different ambulatory assets. We're working to super hard now to bring those together, combine that with the data and analytics that the Company holds. We think that can be truly transformational. So, the challenge is now to bring together these proof points that we have and really deliver an industrial scale across the U.S. We think that's the way to really transform the quality of care for patients and give them reassurance about being able to manage its costs. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. We have time for one last question.\nOperator: And that question comes from Whit Mayo with UBS. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, a lot covered here. Maybe just one outstanding question for me. Just John Muir, I don't really have a sense of the size of that business, not sure what you said or what you can share and is that business additive for you over the first year, maybe just any perspective you can share about the relationship in any potential interest from other health systems to exploring a partnership like that? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay. I'll turn to Dan Schumacher.\nDan Schumacher: Good morning, Whit. Thank you for the question. So, in terms of sizing, John Muir, over the contract, which is a 10-year term, is a $1.6 billion revenue opportunity. And obviously our backlog, it contributes a five-year duration to that as well. I'm pleased to share that we're off to a good start and we've transitioned our employees over the course of the third quarter and it's progressing nicely. More broadly, for us, it really marks an exciting transition for OptumInsight, transitioning from what has historically been a point solution technology provider to more of a diversified enterprise solutions organization. So, what does that mean, how do we fully integrate the combination of our data foundations, our analytic capacities, our technology assets, as well as really the knowhow of our 185,000 people, and we're doing that across both the clinical and administrative domains as we move forward. So, in the wake of the announcement, we have seen some increased entrants for sure, and we're advancing those discussions. And we look forward to it contributing to our growth profile in 2020 and well beyond.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Whit. That's all the time we have today for questions. Thank you for those questions. To summarize, UnitedHealth Group ended the third quarter with strong and diversified performance, once again delivering well-balanced growth across our business. We remain confident about our future business opportunities and look forward to sharing more with you at our investor conference on December 3rd in New York. This concludes our call today. Thank you.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-07-18 20:07:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Earnings Reports and SEC Filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information represented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 18, 2019, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I'll now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann. Please go ahead. \nDavid Wichmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong well balanced revenue and earnings growth across our businesses, continuing trends of the last several years. We have considerable momentum, improving the consumer position and customer experience, applying rigorous net promoter disciplines within a culture built to serve people's most fundamental need their health.  Executing on our mission, helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone, produces value for people, the health system and society, overall, and strong returns for our shareholders.  In the first half of 2019 total revenues grew year-over-year by 9%, or $9.6 billion to $121 billion. Adjusted earnings per share advanced 18%. Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum contributed strongly to these results, generating total enterprise operating cash flows of $9.1 billion or 1.3 times net earnings.  Confidence in our ability to continue to advance our fundamental performance and profitable growth leads us to increase our outlook for full year adjusted earnings to a new range of $17.40 -- $14.70 to $14.90 per share. We are constantly developing and refining our differentiated set of core capabilities, enriching, integrating and applying deep proprietary information sets to improve engagement and clinical decision making, embedding modern analytics and technologies across the system to make it more interoperable, transparent and efficient. And expanding the scope and effectiveness of our clinical capacities, and aligning with others to value based incentives to improve health outcomes while lowering costs. As we work in partnership with the care community and others, these competencies enable us to develop the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. A system that provides high quality, efficient and fair access for all. You can see the latest evidence of our progress on a number of fronts, our recently completed combination with DaVita Medical Group meaningfully expands Optum Care\u2019s nationwide network of physicians.  The John Muir Health strategic relationship announced yesterday is unique and expressive services and demonstrates the roll Optum can play when it\u2019s fully aligned with its customers, serving the needs of local communities. Continued OptumRx gains in employer health plan and coalition markets reflect the distinctive more wide ranging and more modern consumer approaches OptumRx applies to deliver value addressing one of the most challenging burdens of healthcare, excessive drugs and biologic costs. The first 20 million real time interoperable individual health records are being scheduled for market deployment. We remain optimistic about the potential of these deeply personalized health records, and associated next best action recommendations to improve the health of people we serve and the overall system performance. Consumer engagement aligned to this actionable health information plays a critical role in developing the next generation health system. By the end of this year, Raleigh\u2019s [ph] digital engagement capacities will be available to nearly 20% of the U.S. population, solidifying its opportunity to advance individual health at scale. Physician data sharing and value-based incentives round out a true end-to-end alignment of a progressive health system. Value Based payments to care providers are growing at more than 15% in 2019, aligning incentives to practice high quality care, while improving the effective use of health system resources. We expect these value-based payments to ramp at an even more accelerated pace in the coming years. All of these and the examples offered by our business leaders today are only a partial reflection of the steady progress we are making in advancing our enterprise mission to make healthcare work for everyone, so everyone can live healthier lives. The results are compelling. We are lowering costs trends, steadily improving NPS, and achieving improved clinical outcomes, leading to continued long-term sustainable performance and growth for our business. With that, I'll now turn to UnitedHealthcare's new Chief Executive Officer, Dirk McMahon. Most of you know Dirk from when he was first joined UnitedHealthcare in 2003. Having worked in major leadership roles at UnitedHealthcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group he notes firsthand how to maximize the full capabilities of this enterprise, including the clinical capacities of Optum Health, the data insights and advanced technologies of OptumInsight and the distinguished pharmacy care solutions offered by OptumRx. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Dave. Glad to be back at UnitedHealthcare. I'm pleased with what I've seen in the first few weeks in the role, we don't need a major shift in direction, but we will sharpen our focus on delivering consistent growth performance across all market segments. An essential step to drive growth is consistently achieving superior operating and middle co-cost structures. Cost impacts member health when it is a barrier to getting care, and we need to address that even better for people. It\u2019s the primary driver of consumer satisfaction in NPS. When we improve satisfaction in NPS we drive growth. We\u2019ll continue our intense focus on simplifying and improving the experience for people. Using our digital platforms and applications, we can improve our ability to help people navigate the complexities of healthcare and get people on effective care pathways. This creates a better clinical and service experience, which leads to better outcomes, cost containment and satisfied members. Some of the essential elements of this include, better information sharing with consumers and their doctors, creating aligned incentives among consumers, care providers in Unitedhealthcare, tailoring products to consumer needs, providing digital and human navigators to support consumers in their health and care journeys and offering practical technology at key decision points. Simplicity is vital to making healthcare easier, our Navigate4Me offering simplifies and personalizes care for seniors with complex conditions. It provides them with a single point of contact for concierge services, and a dedicated team of experts, supported by a proprietary technology platform with integrated data, navigators help coordinate care through personalized care plans and address social determinacy. Results have been positive, with a 14% reduction in hospitalizations, and a 9% reduction in ER visits for patients with congestive heart failure. Navigate4Me dramatically improves NPS, now nearly 20 points higher than traditional approaches. With nearly 1000 Navigators now in place, we will continue to expand appointment and impact over the coming quarters.  We have created simplified paths, enabling doctors to provide high quality surgical procedures and ambulatory settings. These can be less than half the cost of traditional inpatient settings, with higher quality outcomes and greater consumer satisfaction. And, our recently launched preferred lab networks create paths for patients and -- physicians and patients to use to lower costs testing facilities, make it easier to order labs electronically, and provide turnaround times to results.  From these examples and more across inpatient and outpatient services, we see an opportunity for more than 20 billion in potential annual savings in spend, managed by United Healthcare\u2019s employer and individual business alone and reducing unwanted variations in care, converting care to the most appropriate side of service and aligning with high performing delivery systems. We continue to diversify and extend our employer and individual business, organizing local systems of care physically, virtually and digitally, building collaborative relationships with care providers and sharing data by directionally with them and innovating around product designs.  For example, our partnership with Centura Health announced last year in the Colorado Doctors plan is achieving price points 20% lower than our broad access offerings. Some of the attributes driving this success include the use of effective referral patterns, timely texting with alternative care options when a patient registers at the emergency room and virtual appointment. This is the type of total cost of care product innovation you should expect from us. Likewise at community and state, medical costs and operational improvements are advancing nicely as planned. And on the growth front, we're preparing to serve more people later this year with our recently awarded North Carolina opportunity. Our businesses serving people who are duly eligible for Medicaid and Medicare continue to expand and perform well. The outlook for further growth in this category, and more broadly in the group and individual Medicare Advantage remains exceptional. Year-over-year, we've grown by more than 540,000 people across these important areas greater than 10%. We see significant macro revenue growth opportunities in these categories for years to come. As such, we will continue to invest in many ways ranging from stable benefits to better coordination of care. For example, in 2020, we will provide all duly eligible members with a personal care coordinator to help manage their Medicaid and Medicare benefits and coordinate clinical needs, such as appointment scheduling, filling prescriptions and closing gaps in care. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s financial performance continues to be strong. Revenues grew 6% to $48.6 billion, while operating earnings advanced 12% to $2.6 billion in the quarter. I'm looking forward to working with our team to further elevate UnitedHealthcare\u2019s performance from the strong position we hold today, delivering more value across multiple dimensions in healthcare. Now, let me turn it over to Andrew Witty, Chief Executive Officer of Optum.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Dirk. At Optum, we\u2019re developing and building a broad set of capabilities, supporting a vision for providing better healthcare and increased affordability for more people. This compels us to rethink healthcare can be provided more holistically across the broad and changing healthcare landscape. One significant opportunity for improvement comes in chronic disease care. The 30 million people in the U.S. with three or more chronic diseases account for two-thirds of healthcare spending today, and the number of people is expected to grow to 80 million by 2030.  Managing these chronic patients requires a multidisciplinary hands on approach Optum building in its next generation condition management programs. These include the management of emerging high cost specialty drugs, which are expected to continue to be a leading driver of medical costs inflation. We address these trends through a broad range of approaches, including direct delivery of home and office infusion services, and direct delivery of specialty pharmacy prescriptions to the home with digital care services provided by Optum pharmacist to educate patients on how to properly take their medication. Another challenge Optum is meeting head on is a dramatic rise in oncology drug spending. In the U.S. health system, misaligned incentives lead to administering higher cost oncology drugs unnecessarily. We do think there's a better way. Early results from our integrated OptumCare Cancer Center in Nevada suggests a decoupling oncology drug payments from Dr. Compensation can reduce pharmaceutical spending for seniors by nearly 30%. It drives improved clinical quality based on the best science, while keeping the patients comfort, care and dignity as the highest priority. And ensuring physicians administering the care are paid fairly for their excellent work.  We're exploring other new approaches along therapeutic lines such as chronic heart failure, and musculoskeletal conditions to more comprehensively address care needs of those with significant health challenges. The right delivery of care by physicians would be pivotal to this agenda, as OptumCare seeks to coordinate each patient's care journey with a focus on proactive, preventive medicine, especially for those with the most acute need. Creating value for those we serve translates the stronger financial performance. Over just the last three years, the revenue per consumer served by OptumHealth has grown by nearly 50%. In the quarter OptumHealth total revenue grew 20% to $7.1 billion, while operating earnings advanced 21% to $688 million.  Like OptumHealth, OptumInsight\u2019s positioning and capabilities have evolved over many years. OptumInsight has advanced from what was once primarily a point solution provider of technology to diversified enterprise solutions organization. The business has deep and broad expertise to solve some of the biggest challenges in healthcare for payers, providers, life science companies and governments. Our new multi-year relationship with John Muir Health is distinctive in its comprehensive nature. John Muir is nationally recognized for quality of care as a major independent health system in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our relationship, funds revenue cycle, information technology, ambulatory care coordination, analytics procurement and consulting services. The partnership will deliver broad performance improvement at John Muir and for its patients and physicians. With this another new relationship OptumInsight\u2019s second quarter backlog grew 20% year-over-year or more than $3 billion to $18.5 billion. Revenues advanced 7% to $2.3 billion and operating income increased 16% to $525 million. OptumRx continues to evolve from a traditional PBM to a diversified pharmacy care services organization deeply focused clinically and enabled by vast data and ever improving technologies. This quarter we introduced a new and transparent digital consumer pricing tool. MyScript finder puts lower cost pharmaceutical alternatives and coverage status at people's fingertips. It offers instantaneous consumer relevant cost transparency with actual out of pocket costs based on pharmacy location, benefit plan design and deductible status. So far, consumers have conducted over 1 million searches in the first 60 days of usage. OptumRx continue to win in the market. Its value is resonating with health plans, large employers and purchasing coalitions. We\u2019re driving greater pharmacy and medical care alignment, better service quality, lower costs, improved transparency, and an expanding breadth of services at the local market level, including home infusion, e-commerce specialty and community based dispensing services.  As a result, OptumRx continues to profitably expand share. In the second quarter, revenues advanced by 12% to $18.9 billion and OptumRx added $11 million adjusted scripts year-over-year. These are just a few examples of the progress we've made and how the Optum businesses are advancing the way they serve in both their individual and market segments. And together as they deploy broad based market solutions, and yet we remain at the very early stages of what Optum can be. Now I'll turn to John Rex, CFO of UnitedHealth Group.\nJohn Rex : Thank you, Andrew. Our first half positions us to perform well for the rest of the year. In the quarter, revenues grew 8% to $60.6 billion and net earnings from operations grew 13% to $4.7 billion. All of the business segments contributed strongly to these well balanced results. With previously discussed business transitions now effective as of mid-year, we're updating our full year revenue outlook. With these incorporated, we expect 2019 revenue to be at or just slightly below the original $243 billion to $245 billion range. This reflects the transition of a large OptumRx client due to a business combination and are voluntary withdrawal from a state Medicaid program, partially offset by the DMG combination. Cash flows from operations were $5.9 billion in the quarter and year-to-date are $9.1 billion or 1.3 times net income. For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations of $17.3 billion to $17.8 billion or 1.2 to 1.3 times net income. Medical costs remain well managed with our 2019 medical care ratio tracking well to the range we shared with you back in November of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.  Unit cost remains a core driver of overall trend, and we continue to advance our efforts to optimize both site of service and use of the highest performing clinicians. We continue to expect that 2019 will mark the 11th consecutive year of declining inpatient admissions per 1,000 people.  Our operating costs ratio of 13.9% is impacted by the deferral of the health insurer tax and a strong mix of productivity and operational improvement enterprise wide. And with our focus on affordability, that agenda is never really done. At the same time, we continue to aggressively expand the investments we are making in innovation to drive organic growth and further operational and productivity improvements over the decades to come. In 2019, our effective tax rate is favorably impacted as expected by the deferral of the non-deductible health insurance tax. The second quarter rate was moderately higher than our original outlook. For the full year of 2019, we now expect the tax rate will likely be around 20.5%. That's the upper end of our original range for the year, which is fully incorporated in today's raised earnings outlook and is due impart to lower than expected employee stock-based compensation activity. We continue to maintain balance sheet strength and significant flexibility. Return on equity in the second quarter again exceeded 25%. UnitedHealth Group has a long well developed and proven ability to thoughtfully deploy capital through business combinations that add capabilities and market presence to be leveraged across the enterprise, bringing both synergies and growth and costs. In June, our Board of Directors raised our shareholder dividend by 20% to an annual rate of $4.32 per share. The dividend has advanced at or above 20% each year since initiated about a decade ago, and at about a 30% payout ratio has grown to be more in line with the market level objective we set. Still our long-term earnings growth potential provides ample capacity to continue to advance the dividend at strong rates for years to come. We remain confident as we look forward to the second half of 2019. And now expect adjusted earnings per share of $14.70 to $14.90, an increase of $0.25 from the guidance we established at the end of last year. Within that, as previously discussed, the pacing of weekdays is higher in the third quarter this year, resulting in a relatively consistent level of earnings between the third and fourth quarters.  Delivering on our 2019 commitments and strengthening our business further as we approach 2020 remain critical to us. Even as we pursue ever greater impact for society and advanced growth and returns for our shareholders for years to come. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave. \nDavid Wichmann : Thank you, John. We will continue investing for the future building, innovating and diversifying as we seek to support the development of the next generation health system, a system that provides high quality and efficient access for all, a system that achieves better outcomes and experiences at lower costs for people. This is the essential work of our enterprise. It provides us with an extraordinary opportunity and responsibility to help improve healthcare in the U.S. and globally, and to continue growing our business in these large and fast growing markets. It is why if you spend time at our organization, you can feel the restlessness among our 320,000 dedicated professionals, all focused on making an impact in everything we do, and generating stronger societal and shareholder return. And with that, let's open it up for questions. One question per caller, please, operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First, just let me congratulate and wish John Penshorn on a great retirement, well deserved, you\u2019ll be missed. And then I've got a MLR question a couple parts. So bear with me. First, any color on quarterly medical trends, specifically, you saw very strong development in the quarter, any offsetting trend factors that we should think about? And then you're halfway through the year, can you give us an update on where you see MLR trending relative to the full year guidance of 82.5%? And lastly, you mentioned the days of the week, kind of impacting negatively to third quarter as they positively impact the Q1. So anything you could do to help us thinking about MLR in the third quarter relative to the 81% from last year. Thanks for bearing with me.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks. John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Sure, Justin, good morning. So a few things, just thinking about first of all on your first point here on impacts on quarterly trends. So underlying trend as they stayed very much in line with our expectations, so no change in that in terms of the trend factors we lay out we've talked about and I would say even really no change in the components within that trend. I would say kind of in terms of other things going on in the quarter within that nothing in the cost line. I mean I would point out that in the revenue line there's probably one item I could speak to that would have impact on that. So there's probably about roughly $100 million maybe a little bit more than $100 million of unfavorable revenue adjustment in the commercial business that was booked in the quarter. So you recall there are risk adjustment factors that apply to commercial business for ACA compliant individual and small group products. And so that goes through over a long period of time, our data submissions have been and continue to be highly accurate on that. However, it's kind of a fixed pool in the end. And so there was a true up as there were auto adjustments on other plans, then what happens is that rolls through you get adjusted because of the fixed pool. So that's one element that would have been rolling through in the quarter. And I'd size that in the tune of a kind of $100 million. So that doesn't show in reserves right that\u2019s the revenue adjustment a negative revenue adjustment. So that's one element I point out. I think, in terms of kind of a combining your last two questions Justin, a little bit here. And so 3Q has that extra week day essentially a Monday, whereas -- and 1Q and that you can kind of see in the sequential progression even 1Q to 2Q, 1Q benefited from there being one less weekday than normal. So that does impact progression, whereas typically you would see 3Q is often than one of our higher earnings quarters and my comments, in my prepared comments I talked about kind of relatively stable EPS in between the two quarters. But you're right and thinking about that within the 3Q you should expect that MCR is impacted most like we got the benefit in the 1Q. Does that get at your questions, Justin. \nJustin Lake : Just the MLR for the year the 82.5% and now that we're halfway through the year any anywhere you want us to kind of think about. You feel like you're on track with midpoint or slightly higher or slightly lower.\nJohn Rex: We think we're tracking well on MLR for the year in that range. So -- and well kind of in that zone so nothing notable on that.\nJustin Lake: Great, thank you very much. \nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Justin. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about sort of the commercial membership here, I think at the Analysts Day you guys talked about sort of to see improving membership growth there. The quarter was relatively flat. Can you give us a sense on how we should be thinking about that as we think to the first year given some your comments today?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. Dirk do you want to address that?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Let me start off in the fully insured area. We improved over the first quarter. We had nominal fully insured losses in 2Q. There's no notable areas to mention. We're confident that we price our book consistent with our trend forecast. And we actually see how our pricing approach actually pulled through to the earnings. So that's kind of the fully insured story. As it relates to fee, we lost 80,000 members in the second quarter, but that's normal related to national account seasonal attrition. As we look at our fee business, throughout 2019, what we expect to see is that favorable membership growth above and beyond the acquisition that we made. So that's kind of the commercial membership story.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Charles. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll echo the congratulations to Mr. John Penshorn as well for all his help over the years. I'm curious about the John Muir announcement. I know you guys mentioned it. I'm curious, what makes it unique? Is it just the breadth of services? Or is it -- it sounds like a lot of things that you guys have been in the market doing. And then can you talk maybe a little bit more broadly about preparing large systems to take risk and why Optum thinks it's a good idea for these large systems to be taking more and more risk, even maybe starting with their own health plan. And I guess last part of this, we're seeing a lot of the demand -- we're seeing a lot of the supply in the market from enablers of that type of technology and systems that are doing what Optum is doing. Is there demand that sort of matches that supply? I know it's kind of a lot of questions in there, but just sort of broadly on that topic.\nDavid Wichmann: So maybe Eric can answer the specific question on John Muir and then we'll have Andrew Witty, take the second part there around preparing large systems. \nEric Murphy: Yes, maybe I'll do first and second, if that's okay there, or first and third, sorry. Josh, thanks for the question Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. Our partnership with John Muir Health really represents one of the most comprehensive in the healthcare industry, between a delivery system and a health care services company. The integrated scope of services includes acute and ambulatory revenue cycle management end-to-end information technology services, ambulatory care coordination, enterprise analytics, purchasing and consulting services. It is very unique in the marketplace in that health system has never contemplated putting out that much of a scope of work on both the back office as well as what I'd call the middle office of a delivery system. So it is quite unique and first in the industry, and Optum is ideally suited to be able to address those expansive needs of John Muir Health.  In terms of the third part of your question, our market knowledge suggests that several hundred regional health systems have similar size and market opportunity as John Muir. We\u2019re already in discussions with several high performing independent community based systems and look forward to establishing continued partnerships, similar to John Muir Health, with health systems across the industry. Andrew, do you want to take the second part?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Thanks, Eric. And thanks, Josh, for the question. I mean, clearly, we have a very strong view that the best way forward in terms of improving quality bringing down total cost of care is to increasingly new towards value in terms of the management of the care continuum. That is very much the focus of the OptumCare strategy and is resonant throughout all of our various platforms. But it's also very clear that we're seeing more and more systems begin to look to move in that direction. Where as they look to Optum, they can see portfolios of information systems, skills, which have been developed within our own organization, which are going to be just as useful within those systems as they are within for example, our OptumCare organization. So for us, this is a very important opening up of a new front in terms of the opportunity to develop our interventions in the marketplace, and we believe move to a more sustainable high quality, lower cost healthcare environment.\nJosh Raskin: Thank you. \nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Josh. Next question, please. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Borsch: Yes, I was hoping maybe you could comment on the -- how you're looking at the -- if you're continuing with the same PBM rebate strategy that you focused on. And did that looks any different now that the administration has decided to withdraw from the ban in rebates in Medicare.\nDavid Wichmann: Good question, Matt. Our decisions around rebates and the application of them where pharmacy pricing protection doesn't exist and an existing policy was made independent of any pending regulation and it was done so well over a year ago now, or so. So our commitment to that remains, I think you know that there's, of the policies that exists particularly in the commercial market about 75% of them already have pharmacy price protection mechanisms in them like a copay, whereas the other 25%, and I'm generalizing here, but the other 25% don't. And when that is the case, in particular, when it intersects with some of the legacy high deductible health plans there, it was really compelling for us to drive rebates to the point of sale to create greater affordability for consumers. We just felt that that was the right consumer response.  So that won't change, as we think about moving forward, there are some legislation on HDHP yesterday, which I thought was pretty forward leaning, which allows for greater flexibilities around managing high deductible health plans that would give us greater flexibility as a market leader in that segment to be able to modify those policies and offer a greater range that allows us to be able to deal with the breadth of issues that arise with those policies intersecting with individuals with chronic disease. So we're looking forward also to bringing out new policies that are more responsive broadly to consumer expectations. So you can expect us not to change our stance on rebates.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Matt. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Windley with Jeffries. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi, thanks. Maybe combining a couple of questions. Dave, to your last answer, on this rebate policy and thinking about membership -- commercial membership, I believe the company has said that it is requiring any new customers to go to a point of sale rebate regime is that having a positive or negative affecting in your selling in commercial?\nDavid Wichmann: So there's two elements to this, first was the 8 million to 9 million or so people that are covered with or have a point of sale rebates applied in our fully insured markets, that is pretty close to being done. That was commenced effective January 1, 2019 on renewal date. So we still have some renewals that will take place as a result of that. The impact of that has been $130 per eligible script savings and as much as a 16% improvement in adherence. So we're going to monitor that and really evaluate what the long-term implications are on individual health and the overall use of healthcare resources. The second piece, again, relates to those opportunities that come to us from January 1, 2020 and beyond, that have no pharmacy price protection mechanism in the plan design, which again, would be about 25% of the total plan design. In those situations, we would only take on that case in the -- if we were able to apply rebates at the point of sale, I'm speaking for UnitedHealthcare at this stage. So those are the -- that's the plan for us going forward. In terms of implication, so, there has been no implication with respect to the -- that policy adoption. The one thing we did see pretty quickly thereafter is a lot more interest on the part of large employers and possibly applying the same policy recognizing that consumers are at risk if they have a high cost drugs and policy features that don't protect them from inflation on those drugs.\nDavid Windley: Thank you. \nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, David. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from a Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Just want to get a bit more color on the guidance raise. You raised, the quarter I guess by more than you beat consensus, consensus isn\u2019t always where I guess the company is thinking the numbers are going to be for the quarter. But how much of the guidance raise reflects kind of just the upside that you report in a quarter versus kind of flowing through that upside into out quarters, versus some of the deals that you've closed since last quarter. If you could break into the three components, that would be great. \nDavid Wichmann: The raise reflect the overall confidence we have in the performance of the business, as we sit here today and our prospects for growth. But also, as we look forward to the future as well, but John, can you adjust to the details?\nJohn Rex: Sure, Kevin. So I'd say and the last part of your comment, in terms of any transactions closed immaterial, really, in terms of in terms of what we're doing here today. So those will be, just not that impactful in 2019 to even be noticeable. So really, not about that. I think we tried to show you kind of an impact in terms of the investment income line, in terms of the venture gain that we recognized in the quarter to help level set somewhat on that, in terms of the impact that it had in the in the quarter itself. I think the other component, I would just say that I mentioned in my prepared comments, at least, compared to our outlook, also the tax rate came in about a bit higher for us in the quarter. So providing some offset on that. And then I think in response to Justin's question, I pointed out kind of another impact that was yet another offset on that. So a lot of those factors kind of, as I go through that you can see within the quarter, pretty much washing out in terms of that impact. Does that help, Kevin?\nKevin Fischbeck: Yes, I think that helps. I guess you're saying though, that when you break it out, it's been mostly within the quarter or is it the split between the quarter and rest of the year.\nJohn Rex: I\u2019ll be clear on that. So what I was saying is, in terms of when you look at kind of the impact in the quarter and kind of that go. So what I called out was that we talked about the venture gain, we talked about some other elements that go -- that offset that. So really that drags in, in terms of kind of how we're feeling about our full year and kind of the optimism confidence we have in the full year. Because some of those quarterly elements really wash out.\nKevin Fischbeck: Perfect, thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Kevin. Next question, please. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning. So my questions are around kind of like what we're hearing out of DC. Obviously, the rebate rule is out, but we have some -- couple of new proposals wanted to get your view on them. So the first one, the administration put out recently an executive order that looked at increasing price transparency in healthcare, including requiring providers and insurance to provide or facilitate some access to information about negotiate rates. So I wanted to see kind of like how you think about this, and the potential impact on the competitive dynamics? And secondly, back in May, House Ways [ph] and means kind of like an unveiled its legislation that it would shift to risk of catastrophic coverage, and look at a donut hole from patients and the government to health plans and manufacturers. How do you think about this? Is this yet just another proposal that would ultimately result in higher premium and therefore would be shelved? Or what potential impact do you think it could have on you? Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: There's a lot of policies and proposals and proposed regulation activity going on today. And it's in part mixed with the political campaigns. So there's a lot to -- there's a lot out there. And some of that is subjected to formal processes and others is more just direct commentary. And so our -- I think here for this purpose, we would probably restrict our commentary to general types of themes as opposed to find ourselves commenting outside of the formal process. But -- so I just maybe emphasize a few things here. One is, as it relates to drug prices in particular, I think it's fairly clear now that there's that drug companies set these prices. I think one of the things that was implied in a rebate rule was important emphasis on continuing the PBM\u2019s rule as a counterbalance against those list prices increases, but also direct recognition of the strong value PBMs bring not only in the management of procurement, but also as they manage the pharmacy benefit, as well as in the case of OptumRx distinct value that comes with the intersection of all of that with the medical benefit, driving considerable additional value. We save consumers about $2,000 per year, per consumer in these activities. And I think that folks are starting to realize that and really value it. So I think that that will weigh heavily on whatever ultimately comes out. Also, I think you've also seen that we began bringing really strong value to people through this application of rebates at the point of sale. Really to ensure that consumers are protected from these list price increases overall to the best of our abilities and we'll continue to pursue those activities. And so I think that covers off your -- the kind of the commentary you had about the rebate rule. And the second piece as it relates to the House Ways and means donor hole. Do we have any specific commentary on -- further commentary on that looks like not. So we'll just stick with that response for now.  Thank you, Ricky. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal : Thanks a lot guys. You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, I guess, the one thing on the guidance that you didn't touch is the OCR ratio 14.4% to 15%, I think was the last guy, it seems like it's tracking a little light there. So that's really just my question any color there? And maybe just if I could sneak one more. On the PPD, we would love to know what was entry year verse prior year inside of the 270? Thanks so much.\nDavid Wichmann: John?\nJohn Rex: Yes. Hi, Steve. Yes, no change on our OCR outlook for the year. Though as you kind of if you look at the year-over-year. I'm sure you're well aware the primary change in the OCR is driven by the health insurance tax that gets being offset by strong efficiency and productivity gains. And then of course, we continue to make significant ongoing strategic investments in our businesses. So -- but no change from the outlook, we still expect to be in the guidance range of 14.7% plus or minus 30 basis points for the year.\nSteve Tanal : And the PPD side. \nDavid Wichmann: Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just ask about MA now the bids are in for 2020. I know the company stressed the last few years\u2019 consistency of benefits. We'll get the health insurance be coming back next year. Do you feel like, you'll be able to maintain, at least in a broad sense, consistency of benefits next year and it looks like two of your major competitors in the space that have grown extraordinarily this year have done so via really deploying those benefits of the hip moratorium this year. And presumably they may have to look at that next year. Do you see an opportunity maybe for a little bit of accelerated growth, if you can be consistent next year?\nDavid Wichmann: Good question, A.J.. I really applaud our team's efforts and how they thought through this on a multi-year basis. Brian, you want to give him some details?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks for the question, A.J. To your point, obviously the tax is returning in 2020. As I\u2019ve said before, we will measured and discipline and how we went to market inside 2019. Certainly mindful of that tax headwind returning. I would say our multi-year approach was a critical factor in shaping our optimism around 2020. Our goal and intention is to keep our benefits largely stable to improving despite these headwinds. So, right now, I would say that we're really pleased with our product positioning going into next year and a foundational element was our discipline in 2019.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, A.J. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nPeter Costa: Good morning, and good luck to John Penshorn and congrats to Brad or maybe that should be the other way around. My questions is on DMG, I want to talk about -- the performance of that has been fairly weak over the last few years. And now that you've got it the transaction closed and it's yours. How will you improve the performance of that business? And how quickly do you think you can bring some improved earnings to the bottom-line there?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Peter, for the question. We're pleased to close the transaction out your extraordinarily long time. Dr. Wyatt Decker is here. Wyatt, do you want to talk about what you're doing at DMG?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Peter for the question. At OptumHealth, our care platform we call OptumCare is building the nation's leading value-based physician led and patient focused health care system. We're very pleased to have completed the acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which combines another leading medical center with our practice. We feel confident that as we provide our clinical expertise, analytics and services to the DaVita Medical practices, you will see enhanced performance of the DaVita Medical Group and integration with our leading value based practices. Thank you. \nDavid Wichmann: So Peter, we are pretty pleased with how DaVita transitioned over. Having done -- bring down diligence and looking at the run rate or the performance of the business. So we were pretty pleased with that. And so the foundation from which we will improve that practice and drive the type of synergies that we expect was there. And so we have high confidence you'll start to see some meaningful contributions from that platform in 2020 and beyond. Thanks for the question, Peter. Next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. It's clear the value United and insurers are creating for healthcare affordability and quality when you look at the historical industry cost trend of 7% to 8% being brought down to 6% range with consumerism. And now you have a peer talking about future trends in below 2% range benchmark to medical CPI granted they have some skewing from ASL inclusion. And Dave at a conference last month, you mentioned national health expenditures plus or minus is interesting construct to consider medical costs trend.  So I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on how you think about the right framework for talking about cost trend, whether it's CPI or NHE and if it is national health expenditures, which runs in the mid-5, how do you think about United\u2019s business model being able to produce long-term trend in line or better than national health expenditure trend?\nDavid Wichmann: That's a really thoughtful question, Sarah. So a couple of things. First, we have begun to look at it more closely and thinking about whether how we are contributing to bringing a greater affordability more broadly across the segment of Medicare, Medicaid in commercial. And have started to evaluate that against NHE to determine again, whether we are a contributor to trend or whether we are actually reducing trend. And so that that's something that I think you'll hear more about from us. The other is as we sit here, we oftentimes talk in commercial trend context in these settings. All the while, we have a very robust and large government programs based business. And those obviously have trends inside them as well. So we're trying to think about a way to bring forward a view of that more broadly. So you can assess our aggregate performance across our business. We -- so NHE will be important in that respect. It is a complicated metric in many respects, I can -- I think I can safely say that we are contributing positively to reducing the nation's healthcare burden. And that healthcare burden has been declining over the course of the more recent past. And we would aim very hard to continue to move that forward, recognizing that the way to get that done is to advanced quality first and foremost, which is really the improving outcomes. And then the evaluation of and making sure that we drive efficiency in the use of the nation's healthcare resources in achieving that quality, and then not missing the opportunity to improve the patient experience as well. So this is a very high priority for this organization to contribute in a constructive way to reducing the overall healthcare burden in the U.S. And we believe you can see that in some of the remarks that, informing the health system through the application of the IHR, engaging people and managing their health conditions more proactively through the Raleigh platform and aligning the reward system in healthcare to drive that triple A value is essential to achieving that. And that's the essence of the commentary that I began this call with today. We would add a fourth element to that and that was really around our physicians and providing them a work environment or environment where they can practice medicine, the way they've been trained and to allow them to the freedoms without burnout to be able to deliver solid, high quality outcomes and results for their patient base. And we believe that OptumCare is and UnitedHealthcare broadly is creating just that environment. Thank you for the question, Sarah. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nLance Wilkes: Yes, just had a question with respect to the drivers of growth over in the Optum side of the business. I was wondering for Optum Health, for its growth, how much of that growth was driven from risk taking or the shift to value based reimbursement and however on the PBM side how much was driven by increased use of specialty home delivery?\nDavid Wichmann: Tom Roos, do you want to take that? \nTom Roos: Sure. Thanks very much, Lance. Appreciate the question. So when we look at the growth at Optum broadly, very significant growth and really good market acceptance around the risk taking that we have in OptumCare, and continue to expect to see growth there. As well in other parts of OptumHealth, very much seeing growth in the Optum serve part of the business, which is the part of the business that serves the federal employees as well as military veterans\u2019 part of our business.  And you may recall earlier in the year we announced at the end of last year, we had received a new contract for a community care network. And with that, we were awarded three regions. And when we were awarded that we expected that we would have about 6 million potential new members in there over the next several years and we've driven very well at the implementation of regions one, and two. And just continuing to drive success in that market. And then the other area that I would focus on is Optum financial services as well.  One of the leading health services, financial institutions with about 5.5 million consumer accounts and very significant growth in assets under management as well. And just continuing to really drive growth in that part of the market to really help with tools and capabilities for consumers to be able to drive decision making that they use to access care and to be able to fund and serve those individuals as they're making decisions around care choices, and affordability. So really good solid growth in that area, as well, I would say in the PBM the really strong acceptance of pharmacy care services models, you see the wins that both Dave and Andrew talked about in script and in their prepared comments, just really solid growth in that area.  And then also on OptumInsight, strong acceptance in terms of market approach on large deals like the recent announcement of John Muir Health and the strength of bringing healthcare technology services into that part of the market to be able to help with moving the risk and also being able to be more effective in delivering care to consumers and individuals.  So I would look at the full spectrum and say really good, solid opportunities to drive good organic growth that we've been seeing across all of Optum.\nDavid Wichmann: Good question, Lance. Hopefully you read in all that that even we oftentimes showcase certain elements in the call here, but there's a very strong underlying and diverse base of businesses inside Optum that are advancing value to consumers on and the health system broadly on multiple different dimensions. We are running short of time. So I think we can take two more questions. And then we'll conclude the call. Next question, please.\nOperator: And we'll go to Michael Newshel with Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open. \nMichael Newshel: Thanks. Going back to the history, is there any talent with embedded into the 2019 guidance now for midyear commercial intervals that they can return to the fee for the 2020 months of similar to what you saw in 2017?\nJohn Rex: So yes, so just -- thanks for your question there. So not meaningful in terms of any kind of impact there. But every year so we're getting a little familiar with things like this that come in and out of the outlook here. So kind of individually discrete factors that may influence the annual growth rate, I wouldn't call it meaningful in terms of any kind of impact on that for 2019. But yes, this thing will come back again in 2020, comes in, in and out, it seems to insert some in year impact. While given the diversity of our business space, it's usually, really not all that material for us. We look at it as kind of a -- an element that should be addressed here ultimately as you reintroduce that to the system. But nothing material that I call out in the 2019 outlook.\nMichael Newshel: All right. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I'm surprised that no one has asked about this. Any initial commentary on sort of 2020 and specifically if you can size the hist [ph] and headwinds, in terms of just size dollars there. And whether or not that'll hinder your ability to grow within your 13% to 16% target range at this point? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Well, no, I guess, I'll start by saying I appreciate the valiant attempt to 2020 guidance, which we won't be providing here today. And keeping that long held custom we will provide some initial thoughts in October with our third quarter earnings call and then we'll provide really detailed view at our investor conferences as we always do. I will offer a few thoughts, because I think you asked a good thoughtful question there. So first as it relates to our 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth objective is just that, but long-term outlook not meant to be a single quarter or a single year point estimate. I think as I reflect back a little bit, let\u2019s say over the last decade or so, let's see. So we've through today reported 42 quarters, right. I'd say annual average growth rate over that period has been 18%, but including where I expect to land in 2019, we had seven quarters that have all been well above or within that 13% to 16% target and four that were below.  If I call a little more granularity, I think about 42 quarters, we've had 28 that were in or above that guidance range and 14 were below. So it's a pretty strong batting average against the long-term growth rate. And we expect it's going to continue to be quite strong for the decade to come. But it's a long-term growth rate, and we manage the business to sustain that growth in the future. We don't -- typically there aren't in discrete individual factors that we see as that have really influenced that and I can think about many factors that have occurred over the course of this company, whether it was going back to stars or other elements or years where Medicare rates were not -- where we're different than maybe expected. The hit is just the favor that comes in and out and openly passes through also. I think a few things that, I know you're all well aware of here though, it is a cost that's ultimately shouldered by American families, small businesses and seniors. It's a non-deductable task to comes in and you've seen it come in and out. And I know you all are deeply aware of the mechanics and for us, it\u2019s just mechanics passes through. But it comes in and out and cut insert year, end year impact sometimes when it comes in and out. As I said in the last -- response to last question, given the diversity of our business, it's just not really all that material to us. But it's noticeable that, things like I'd point out that, again, you're well aware of non-deductible nature of the tax alone adds 300 to 400 basis points to our effective tax rate. That's just the math of it. There's the calendar year versus policy year differentials on the commercial business, I can go on. But I'm confident that after several years of this, by now you're all aware of those impacts.\nDavid Wichmann: Right. Thank you, John. Thank you all. So I\u2019d just like to maybe sum up where we are, as we close out this call. UnitedHealth Group ended the first half of 2019 with considerable momentum delivering strong, well balanced earnings growth across all of our businesses. It's with confidence that we're expanding -- with our expanding capabilities and available growth opportunities that we increased our outlook for full year adjusted earnings per share. Optum and UnitedHealthcare both perform strongly in the quarter. Both are focused on lowering costs and improving health outcomes and the consumer experience as they seek to help advance the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. A system that provides high quality, efficient and fair access for all. This concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: And this will conclude today's program. You may now disconnect. And have a great day."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-16 18:58:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial Reports and SEC Filings section of the company\u2019s Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 16, 2019, which may be accessed from the Investors page on the company\u2019s website. I'll now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann. \nDavid Wichmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported a strong start to 2019 with revenues up 9%, adjusted earnings per share growing 23% and return on equity of nearly 27%. Optum and UnitedHealthcare each contributed fully to this performance. With confidence and continued momentum, we are raising our earnings expectations for 2019. The continued growth and earnings performance of our business is a byproduct of our focus on providing exceptional returns to society by improving healthcare affordability, outcomes and the patient experience, what some refer to as the triple aim. This orientation frames our growth strategy, informs capital allocation decisions and shapes the operating plans for UnitedHealth Group's businesses, all directed towards attaining the promise of our mission. It's that same mission strategy and approach we have pursued since 1998, when UnitedHealth Group was well less than a tenth its current size and when our strength and our line capabilities and capacities did not nearly match our ambitions for the health system as they do today. Over that 20-year time period, UnitedHealth Group has applied competencies in data, technology, clinical insights and well-formed innovation and adaptive traits to drive change and grow strong market positions in the large and fast growing healthcare end market. Our outlook for growth continues today as the pace of innovation and our capacities for change advance in a market restless for achieving improved value, access and coverage in a sensible and durable way. The first quarter saw several developments illustrating some of the strongest progress yet on this journey, which we expect will build considerable shareholder value. In pharmacy care services OptumRx announced that point-of-sale consumer discounts on branded pharmaceuticals will be its fundamental approach to business. And UnitedHealthcare is well underway implementing point-of-sale discounts at scale for the more than eight million consumers covered through its commercial risk business. At the counter, people are already saving about $130 per eligible script and we are prepared to participate in the CMS demo project for Part D effective January 1, 2020 to drive great \u2013 even greater pharmacy value for more people. In digital health, our initiatives are accelerating. We completed beta testing of the individual health record physician platform and have built over five million active consumer health records. Simultaneously, our enhanced Rally consumer digital health platform now integrates digital engagement, coaching, telemedicine, and incentives with quality and advanced cost transparency and estimating capabilities. We provide access to both proprietary and third-party services in areas such as exercise, weight, sleep, employee assistance, nutrition, and other value-based programs. In its initial 1 million member deployment this year, the enhanced Rally experienced a 13% increase in consumer engagement. We expect those numbers to further advance as the IHR and other functionality are added. As part of our strategy to reinvent health care delivery, we apply Rally and the IHR together with OptumCare's practice capacities to advance efficacy and value. We are progressing toward the close of the DaVita Medical Group transaction and we look forward to adding more markets, more doctors, and clinical staff serving more patients. And we continue to modernize the financing of delivery systems, whether they are owned by Optum or accessed through more modern UnitedHealthcare benefit designs across all market segments. These benefit designs will be more consumer responsive and address social determinative care, especially for those who are most affected and who have the greatest and most complex needs. Nearly 80% of what influences the person's health relates to non-traditional medical and behavioral issues such as food, housing, transportation, and health care finances. Improving care for society is behind our partnership initiative with the American Medical Association to standardize how data regarding critical social and environmental factors is collected, processed, and integrated. Nearly two dozen new ICD-10 codes will be used to trigger referrals to social and government services to better address people's unique needs connecting them directly to local and national resources in their communities. Finally, our Net Promoter Scores continued to advance meaningfully in the first quarter 2019 as we march towards an aggressive target of 70 by 2025. The people we serve will benefit as we advance quality and value and in turn, provide growth and returns for shareholders. Before I ask Andrew Witty to update you on Optum, I know there has been public discussion about Medicare for all proposals. We view the discussion first through the prism of our mission and how individuals can be better served and the health system can work better for all. From their perspective, we welcome the contrast between these proposals and the kind of real progress we are talking about on this call and discuss with you at our November conference founded on durable and modern information, technology, and clinical capabilities. The wholesale disruption of American health care being discussed in some of these proposals would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation's health system, and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best. And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs, all without fundamentally increasing access to care. The path forward is to achieve universal coverage and it could be substantially reached through existing public and private platforms. Meaningful progress in health care lives and national and state leaders continuing to work collaboratively with the innovative and proven private sector solutions to achieve the goals we all want, a modern, reliable, informed, and aligned health care system that offers the access, choice, and coverage protections people seek at a fair cost to the individuals and society as a whole. Together, we need to operationalize real changes that promote an interoperable secured digital infrastructure allowing information to be shared securely and widely so proper clinical decisions can be made and acted upon by qualified physicians with aligned incentives for achieving better outcomes. Changes that eliminate unnecessary and costly regulatory frameworks and taxes that address underinvestment in social determinants of health, and changes that encourage people to take accountability to modify lifestyle behaviors that drive a significant percentage of their lifetime health care needs. The best system is one, which is informed, engaged and aligned where people, their doctors in the private and public sectors work together to improve or sustain individual health while improving the performance of the health system for everyone. We are encouraged to see the United States is on an improving path. For 16 straight months, the healthcare's relative economic burden on society has lessened. While recent year-over-year spending growth at just over 4% is still too high, it is less than considerably due to the better management of price inflation and the earlier and more effective management of care and lower cost settings. The progress and ideas we have and we'll discuss further today will take healthcare to an entirely new level of quality, cost, choice and coverage in a proven and lasting way, ensuring the U.S. health system better serves and supports all Americans. Now, let me turn it to Andrew Witty, CEO of Optum to discuss Optum's focus, strong operating and financial results, and growing forward momentum. Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Dave. Our next chapter involves accelerating digital, transforming pharmacy care through OptumRx and reinventing healthcare services through OptumCare. While, allowing all of Optum's resources to better serve patients directly and supporting the work of physicians, hospitals and health plans who also serve them. Primary care represents well under 10% of medical cost that has a profound influence on the other 90% of the cost and quality of care. Within OptumHealth we offer densely rate, local care options built on a foundation of owned and operated primary care alongside aligned networks, together improving how the health system is accessed and used downstream. Today, we serve millions of patients across the approximately 80 health plans and payers, in this year virtually every local OptumCare practice will participate in advanced value-based care arrangement. Our clinical team continues to advance performance with our physicians delivering, better quality outcomes with 99% to seniors served through advance value-based arrangements receiving a star rating of four stars or higher. Delivering lower costs with practices serving Medicare Advantage participants at as much as 30% lower cost than original Medicare, and 10% to 15% lower than typical Medicare Advantage, and with higher satisfaction with an NPS of just under 80. In addition to primary care and local communities, we own and operate surgical care centers, neighborhood urgent care center, community pharmacy dispensaries, and in some markets, hospitalist and specialty and ancillary care capabilities, such as office space consist of specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology services. For example, our new OptumCare Cancer Center in Nevada takes an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to providing patient centric care in a professional and compassionate setting. This outpatient program delivers integrated medical, surgical and radiation oncology, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, imaging, palliative care, and 24-hour oncology urgent care. This is one of the ways we are exploring value-based specialty model that uniquely aligns while our primary care and ambulatory capabilities, grounding in a physician led culture of evidence-based medicine and enhanced by academic and community partnerships. All of these services produce better outcomes than outdated and costly facility-based alternative and generate high NPS, because the patient experience is distinctively better. We're accelerating the process of connecting these elements to create informed comprehensive open-market care systems seamlessly supporting the patients we serve, all on a fiercely multi-payer basis, while supporting physicians seeking to operate practices at their fullest clinical capabilities. Our journey of adding and enabling new locations to extend the reach, while deepening our clinical offerings will continue to improve our impact for years to come. We are architecting a more broadly informed, engaged and aligned healthcare system, one that responds better to consumer preferences while easing the burden of healthcare on society. This quarter's growth in revenue per consumer served 14% of last year indicates we\u2019re taking responsibility from a more of a consumer's health and serving them more deeply and compressively. On March 12, OptumRx extended our leadership on negotiated drug discounts by announcing that we will only serve new employees onto pharmacy benefit business after January 1, 2020 that provides consumer discounts to the point of sale. This replaces the current system, which employer's typically elect to flow rebate back to all plan participants to lower their premiums. Benefits of this new approach are clear. Our data shows patient's prescription adherence improves up to 16% depending on plan design and we know patients health ultimately improved, when they follow physician orders for drug regimens. This approach is been proven to achieve medical cost savings of up to $300 per member per year and we have received strongly positive feedback from employers, employer coalitions, industry observers, regulators and policy leaders. We're also seeing strong response to PreCheck MyScript which offers care providers instant information on efficacy cost and alternative drug choices directly within the physician's workflow. Nearly 150,000 physicians are using this technology now, up 77% since December. Our near-term plans for pharmacy care services remain focused on achieving the highest quality outcomes, the lowest net cost of drug for patients, and the best patient experience. Market response continues to be outstanding. 2019 was a good sales year for us. And with robust RFP activity and a couple of significant wins already, 2020 should be even better. OptumInsight the technology and analytics engine of our enterprise continues to provide our customers strategic insights to improve health system performance. We're in the process of launching a newly develop services and technology offerings with our state customers. These end-to-end approaches used advanced technologies to modernize traditional Medicaid administrative offerings, including the comprehensive integration of cutting-edge Optum Analytics services and capabilities deeply enhancing the breadth depth and effectiveness of these state administered offerings. As Dave mentioned in consumer digital health, we've started beta testing the consumer version of the IHR and envision a stage deployment starting around mid-year. We also studied the impact of deploying the IHR for people in the Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial markets and found better outcomes, lower cost and improve patient experience. When placed in the hands of a qualified high-performing doctor in a value-based system, the IHR meaningfully reduces healthcare costs. In a similar way, on March 28, we launched a consumer version of the PreCheck MyScript technology called MyScript finder. Rally now has over 24 million registered users, having grown adoption by over two million people in this quarter alone. Consumers earned a record $200 million in rewards in the first quarter, demonstrating their high engagements. And forward thinking employers have made more than $1 billion in annual rewards available to people who've taken actions to improve their own health. Our software engineering are now building digital payment and physician office visits scheduling capabilities and deploying artificial intelligence and biometric data to improve post-acute patient recovery and reduce hospital readmissions. Rally and platforms like the IHR are just two critical elements of the more modern information and digitally enabled health system. Particularly when coupled with rewards and support tool they enable physicians to more effectively manage their patients at scale. Turning to Optum's financial results. First quarter revenues of $26.4 billion grew 12%, led by OptumHealth growth of 17%. We added $7 million adjusted scripts achieved 14% growth in backlog and now serve two million more people at OptumHealth. Optum's operated margin of 7.1% expanded 10 basis point over last year's first quarter, contributing to 14% growth in operating earnings to nearly $1.9 billion in the quarter. These results illustrate our steady momentum as customers respond to the innovation insight and the value that Optum provides. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealth's CEO.\nSteve Nelson: Thank you, Andrew. The market is responding to UnitedHealthcare's practical innovations, personalization and service performance on behalf of those we serve. Within just the past quarter, we've been awarded contracts to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in North Carolina and Arizona. And again drove strong growth in serving people in Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans. Our innovative Navigate4Me service addresses the personalized holistic care needs of our senior population. Medicare Advantage seniors with complex health issues like diabetes, congestive heart failure or multiple chronic conditions received concierge service from nearly 1,000 dedicated experts. Each serves as a single point of contact for the seniors. Our navigators provide support for clinical and administrative needs, help patients follow their personalized care plans, coordinate care and address social determinants of health. Key to delivering this flexible personal service is the proprietary technology platform that supports navigators with integrated data, analytics and information specific to each patient and the results have been impressive. We've seen a 14% reduction in hospitalization for people with congestive heart failure. And overall 19 point increase in NPS from patients who received our direct support. We're also better coordinating medical services through locally organized systems of care, highly capable of physical digital and virtual care delivery. Our data shows that seniors in our Medicare Advantage Plan C on average about one-half the number of doctors have similar seniors using original Medicare. This means a simpler, less confusing experience and better outcomes for patients and better use of scarce health system resources overall. It is not a coincidence that seniors are enrolling in private Medicare plans at a record pace with one-third of the nation's seniors served today by the private market. Collectively, Medicare Advantage plans provide significant savings and invest those savings in superior benefits not available under original Medicare. Medicare Advantage fills in the significant gaps left by original Medicare, including coverage for pharmacy, dental, vision, hearing and personal wellness and fitness needs. Again, none of them are covered by original Medicare. This strong trend toward greater use of private services includes the state Medicaid programs, for states are increasingly asking the private sector to take responsibility for the care of their most complex and chronically ill beneficiaries. Managed care has a track record of reducing cost by better coordinating care for these people, while helping them become healthier. Looking at our first quarter financial performance, UnitedHealthcare's revenues grew 8% to $48.9 billion, serving three-quarters-of-a-million more people domestically with medical benefits in the quarter, led by growth in Medicare Advantage and in serving self-funded employers. UnitedHealthcare's operating earnings grew 23% over last year to nearly $3 billion in the quarter, with operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 6%. We are hard at work on enabling our business for future growth. In Medicare Advantage, we believe we are well positioned to advance our market share. Further implementation work for recent Medicaid awards is in progress, coupled with our strong activity in the commercial group Medicare and global markets we expect to continue to drive sustained and diversified growth. Now I'll turn the call over to UnitedHealth Group's Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. \nJohn Rex: Thank you, Steve. Our initial quarter for 2019 positions us well to deliver on our full year financial commitments. To recap, revenues grew 9.3% to $60.3 billion, even after considering the negative 1.4% impact related to the health insurance tax deferral for 2019. In the first quarter alone, this deferral helped improve affordability for the people we serve by more than $700 million. This tax adds billions in cost to system and constrains access and benefits for Americans. We continue to advocate and are hopeful for its permanent repeal. In the quarter, the more than $5 billion revenue increase was led by same-store growth, well balanced across our benefits and services platforms. Medical cost trends continue to be well managed and consistent. Our view of forward trends and our first quarter medical care ratio of 82% continue to support our full year outlook for an MCR of 82.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Favorable reserve development, up $300 million was consistent with the year ago level. And medical payables at 49 days were also stable with the year ago level. Earnings growth in the quarter was also driven by improvements in our operating cost position. While the health insurance tax deferral lowers the operating cost ratio, beyond this factor, strong improvements in productivity more than offsets our ongoing investments to drive growth for the future. We will continue to pursue such investments as our focus remains firmly on the decade ahead. Overall, operating margins expanded 70 basis points over last year to 8%. And first quarter adjusted earnings per share up $3.73, grew 23% over last year. First quarter cash flows of $3.2 billion were consistent with our expectations, recognizing that comparison with last year was affected by the health insurance tax deferral. Recall that reported cash flows were limited in the first three quarters of 2018 by collecting the health insurance tax from customers over the course of the year and then impacted in the fourth quarter by the $2.6 billion payment to the U.S. Treasury. Additionally, we would note that certain government payments received in the second quarter of 2018 are not scheduled to be received until the third quarter of this year, simply due to calendar time. All-in, we expect second half 2019 cash flows will be meaningfully above last year's, most notably in the third quarter, with second quarter commence slightly lower. We continue to expect double-digit percentage growth in cash flows from operations in 2019 to a range of $17.3 billion to $17.8 billion. We continue to put capital to work to build the business for the benefit of both society and our shareholders with a robust organic and inorganic growth agenda. We are currently active in each of the five growth pillars previously detailed as we look ahead 10 years and expect to grow and diversify our earnings streams inside this focused, dedicated health care company. We also returned $3.9 million to shareholders this quarter through the present and share repurchase activity. And return on equity was strong at 26.8%, rising 300 basis points from one year ago. Looking forward, we entered the second quarter with strength, flexibility, and rising confidence in the positive impact we can have this year and far into the future. We continue to expect strong growth in adjusted net earnings in 2019, and have increased our outlook to a range of $14.50 to $14.75 per share. That would bring for one-year earnings growth rate to 13% to 15%, and our five and 20-year compound earnings growth rates to approximately 20% per year. Dave?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. Over the past 45 years, UnitedHealthcare Group has grown consistently through the full range of macroeconomic, health care, legislative, and policy conditions, adapting and adjusting to deliver value for all those we serve in ever-changing environment. That value is rising at an accelerated pace. As we execute against our multidimensional growth agenda and health care delivery, pharmacy, digital, consumer response to benefits and global. These efforts for suited scale position us uniquely as a technology-enabled healthcare company, delivering distinctive results to our customers and to society. Taken together with our commitments to service, quality, and NPS, our investments in the coming wave of health care innovation, a movement we intend to lead and our multi-year, multibillion-dollar effort to improve our medical and operating cost basis for the benefit of our customers, we expect sustained growth and performance for UnitedHealth Group this year, in 2020, and for many years beyond. Thank you. We will now take one question per caller please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPeter Costa: Good morning, and thank you for the Medicare for All discussion. Now it's your job to get your members and healthcare workers and employees to understand the same message that you gave to us. Moving on to the rebate structure, as drug rebates go away, can you tell us what that will do to margins in your PBM and to premiums in your healthcare plans?\nDavid Wichmann: First, Peter thank you for the acknowledgment of the Medicare for All commentary. We will definitely fall-through to make sure that this is well understood because we think the options are clear between the government sponsored or government run system and the one we have to offer. So we'll make sure we keep moving in that direction. Andrew, you do you want to take the pharmacy question?\nAndrew Witty: Peter thanks for the question. I just like to make a couple of introductory questions and then I'll ask John Prince to say, comment specifically on the margin element. I think in terms of this whole rebate conversation that's been going on, there were really two elements to this that we really need to keep a very close eye on. The first and most important of all of this is what is going to be the ongoing mechanism to ensure pricing discipline for pharmaceutical products. As you well know the only mechanism that exists today is essentially the volume that\u2019s aggregated by companies like OptumRx to be able to then negotiate effectively with pharmaceutical companies who otherwise would have complete independence on what they do with their list prices. That\u2019s something, which must not be lost in this set of conversations and discussions, which are going on at this time. There is a real risk that if there is a situation where rebates or a mechanism to replace rebate was not in place because the significant drug price inflation, over the next years that would set back a huge amount of the efforts that being achieved over the last 10 or 15 years to try and bring more control to this area. The second part is -- to your question and I'll ask John to really give you a little bit more detail is, obviously, the migration for a company like OptumRx. And John has led a very successful strategy in first of all diversifying the pharmacy servicing offering from OptumRx, and secondly moving into a modern physician of passing forward at this point-of-sale to consumers. You've seen a lot of progress there this quarter, and also developing the way in which we work with our customers to ensure there are mechanism of compensation for the service we delivered is less and less dependent on rebates, the vast majority of which we passed through to our customers. John, if you like to add any specific detail?\nJohn Prince: Peter thanks for question leading on OptumRx. We've been working for years on transforming our pharmacy care services in two ways; one, is expanding how we deliver value to our clients who are integrated medical behavioral pharmacy experience, lets focus on total cost of care and health outcomes. We've also been very focused on driving the transparent business model where more and more of our revenues coming from administrative fees value sharing mechanisms that align us with the consumer the client's needs. So with that context, we see over time minimal impact from our margins, because if you look at the rebates and discounts that we managed. Overall, rebates only exist on 7% of prescription, 90% of what we manage is generic with no rebates, 10% is brand and subset to that is rebatable drug, when you look at in the Medicare market today none of that value we\u2019ve managed from a discount rebate is held by us, it's 100% is passed on to our clients. And fully disclosed with CMS the 100% is passed on the Medicaid market, within our total client base. 98% of our discounts are passed on to our clients. So when you look at an overall standpoint, we're driving that value and passing on to our client. Over time that remaining 2% is a client choice and how they want to pay for our services. And so our believe is that overtime that remaining 2% we would work with our clients to look for other alternatives for them to pay for our services, which we are actively encouraging to manage, how we get our paid for our services.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDave Windley: On Medicaid, wondered if you could comment on the progress in fixing or improving the performance of the handful of markets that you've called out in prior calls and in that context maybe comment on your decision to exit Iowa? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. We'll do Dave. We're seeing nice progress in Medicaid. Year-over-year we saw nice progress in the quarter. But I think I'll have Heather Cianfrocco our CEO of that business. Over to you - those for you.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Heather Cianfrocco leading Community & State. So as you mentioned, yes we highlighted that we had pressure in a handful of markets. Last year, we continue to make progress as David Wichmann noted. We saw this quarter some nice growth in our operating earnings year-over-year and we also saw a couple of good wins. So you heard us talk about North Carolina as well as our Arizona Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities contracts. We also saw strong decent growth. I'll tell you that, with respect to that handful of markets, we've made progress in most of them and we're working to improve our performance. Our performance still is not exactly where we expected to be, and we'll continue to work on that through the year and you can expect to see improvement there. But Iowa was some of those markets. And unfortunately, even though we have put the same work into Iowa, there was a funding increase last year by the administration, due to systemic underfunding of that program over the years, inability to catch-up with what continue to be medical cost pressure and some really unique system design elements of that program recognized across the industry we were unable to make that a sustainable market for us and continue to deliver the high-quality services that we believe Iowa deserves from UnitedHealthcare. So we did make the decision to exit that market. You'll see us exit Iowa, unfortunately by June 30th. We're proud of the services that are employers predominantly have delivered in that market and the impact we think we've made on the hundreds of thousands of Medicaid members. But with respect to the rest of the markets, we're continuing to make progress. We think we'll see improvement in some funding cycles that are \u2013 they are upcoming over the next few months and we're on track with our performance optimizations.\nDave Windley: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Dave in summary nice improvement quarter-over-quarter, first quarter, a solid operating earnings growth despite negative impact of the HIF. But I think it's -- also should be said that we're still underperforming in this business and it'll probably take us until 2020 to get to our full performance expectation which we're performing at a margin somewhere in the 3% to 5% zone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Can you give us an update on progress with the government around the DMG acquisition? And would also appreciate any commentary around management decision to do about two-thirds of the full year share repo in the first quarter? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. I'll take DMG and then John Rex can take share repo. So we remain very excited about this opportunity to expand geographic reach with DMG and to serve more people. It is a critical part of the strategy that we have around reinventing health care delivery to access more markets and at the same time then go much deeper into those markets to make them work much more effectively. At this stage, we have a clear path to approval in closing of the transaction, but unfortunately, we cannot comment on further details or timing at this stage. We are working through a couple of matters that remain. John, you want to touch on repo?\nJohn Prince: Sure. The $3 billion of share repo that we did in the quarter is against our $4 billion to $5 billion full year outlook. It is about the same percentage that we did in the year ago quarter. Also we did $2.65 billion in the year ago 1Q. So we also did a significant portion of our full year in that 1Q. Certainly, I would say that market conditions warranted that if we look at this year particularly warranted that we accelerate our timing on share repurchase. We try to maintain good flexibility in terms of how we approach that program and also maintained good flexibility in our balance sheet overall. So that was kind of -- that was really decision was premised on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: So I have a high-level question on Medicare Part D related to the rebate proposal. I think when we spoke at our conference last month and the view was that UNH and other Part D players could prepare multiple bids to cover all the different scenarios for 2020. Even now with the CMS guidance stating that plan sponsorship data on the current status quo, but then we'll provide protection with that demo program. Now the question is I'm curious if you think this demo program is a fair compromise for Part D plan sponsors? Or does this make you have to perhaps rethink your Part D bidding strategy for next year? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, it certainly can be. But Brian, you want to touch on that Brian Thompson?\nBrian Thompson: Steven, Brian Thompson here. We certainly support the administration's effort to lower drug cost for seniors. I do think that over the long-term, this could provide lower pricing, we have better transparency, but we want to balance that as he suggested against premium increases here in the short term. For context, if we exclude members today without any cost sharing, we suggest that perhaps the one-third will benefit in the near term leading two-thirds perhaps. We're soft as you mentioned timing right now remains uncertain, but CMS clarified the bids should assume the current rules as they apply. And as you mentioned, CMS is providing some protections in form of a risk corridor, that plans it had lowered premiums with rebates, we'll be able to apply and we're certainly appreciative of that guidance. I will suggest that it won't fully mute an increase in member premiums, but will be helpful. We certainly intend to participate in the demonstration to the extent the new rule does impact our plans. I will say that I don't think the corridor protections are going to meaningful change bid strategies, or competitive behaviors. It's important to remember, these are partial protections and they only apply if the rule passes, so plans need to be disciplined in their pricing regardless. I will just leave with the comment around this context. Important to remember, we're only talking about rebates and where they apply, as they've ever been retained by plans, whether that's point-of-sale or in premium and when. So while there's certainly some uncertainty, we appreciate the addition clarity that we've received from CMS and we'll be ready to bid here in early June like we always are.\nDavid Wichmann: So it is a constructive step forward. One that is born in the collaboration between CMS and the Part D carriers and we look forward to participating in the Part D program.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nFrank Morgan: We'll stay on rebates. I'm just curious with regard to the recent announcement you made, any interest so far or any color around what your current self-insured customer base? How that's being received? And do you think that will any way affect new business when you going into 2020? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I think there's growing interest, broadly. But, John Prince, you want to start with OptumRx?\nJohn Prince: It's John Prince with OptumRx. I'd say, first of all, one; we are pleased with why we did it, because there's significant bias from a consumer affordability standpoint. And so, I think, when you have conversations with customers and with other stakeholders, they're very interested in what is the impact of the discounts that we have negotiated on behalf of our clients and its material. So its $130 of value per script -- per eligible scripts which is material. The value in terms of driving higher adherence is also important from a health outcome. So, when we have conversations with our clients, they're very interested in our data and understand how it's impacted consumers. We've had very positive interactions and feedback on it. So I'd say, when you look at the health plan market in addition to UnitedHealthcare, we've had strong interest with our other 45 health plans, where a lot of them are actually looking at how they would incorporate that. And so, I think, there is strong interest in other clients that are on health plan basis to adopt it. When you look at the employer market, there's strong interest in new clients as well as existing clients interested in how to phase that in overtime. And remember, in terms of what we announced, this does not affect our 1/1/20 selling season. This just requires everybody after 1/1/20, so starting January 2, 2020.\nDavid Wichmann: So a bottom line of that, Frank, was there's growing interest in the market. It's a little bit slower to adopt. We'd like to see faster adoption. And we are clearly taking a position to, at least, for a certain plan designs to make sure that consumers are getting those discounts to apply it at the point-of-sale, which we know improves adherence and hopefully will improve their long-term health. Thank you for the question, Frank. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: The market seems to be concerned to some degree about -- I guess both maybe on the managed-care side and PBM side after these are good point-of-sale rebates or move away from rebates entirely. So, I just want to get may be a little bit more color from you about your experience so far in 2019 on the commercial risk side, on the business that you moved over? I assume that the margin profile there is similar to what it was previously, but may be just comment on that. And then as far as the PBM side with these new contracts that you're talking about post-2020, I assume that the economics in that business is also similar to your core business, so may be just confirm those two points.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, Kevin I think the most compelling part of point-of-sale rebate application and the commercial markets for UnitedHealthcare and I'll have Dan comment on this in a moment as well, but is the fact that per eligible script, we're serving consumers a $130 per script. And we're seeing adherence rates as high as -- improvements as much as 16%. So, the impact on society and the people we serve is probably the most compelling part that I want to remain unnoticed. I think as it relates to the financial effects of it is fairly much -- pretty much in line with what are expectations were overall, but Dan do you have any additional comments?\nDan Schumacher: That's right Dave. Our expectations on the outcomes for very much in keeping with what we thought going on. And the reality is, it's very meaningful impact for the individuals that are taking high-cost specialty medications that Dave mentioned and they are very compelling savings for them. But when you look at it the overall medical and pharmacy offering, it's a more modest impact.\nDavid Wichmann: And overall it was a modest impact in part because there is that perception that the people are deeply exposed to price inflation and pharmacy and the reality is that most the plan designed that exist in the market today still have significant price protections in place like a pharmacy co-pay as an example. John you want to broaden that up for OptumRx?\nJohn Prince: Yes sure. Maybe to set the overall point was just the driving the plan for rebates does not impact our bottom-line or our economics. This is around driving solutions that drive affordability to the consumers we serve and that's why we're doing it. This is making sure that the value that we extract from the market actually goes to the consumers and so I think that's the core element on it. We do believe that it's important to have mechanisms like a discount that we negotiated with pharma manufacturers in order to control cost in outer years. So, I think that's also left in the discussion is that there needs to be mechanisms that check against the price increases in the future years.\nOperator: Next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSarah James: I was hoping that you could update us on some of the growth initiatives for OptumCare. Thinking about recent comments that you've made about may be that business growing to multiples of the size that it is, then growing from 30 markets to 75. How should we think about the mix of products that you want to target during that growth and the pacing if it would be ratable growth over time or if it's going to come in larger chunk due to our focus on M&A. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Andrew Witty?\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Sarah thanks very much. Andrew Witty. In a second I'm just going to hand over to Dr. Wyatt Decker. It's good opportunity for me to introduce to you. He's just joined us from the senior leadership at Mayo Clinic Network in Arizona. And he's taken over as the leader of our OptumHealth business. Andrew Hayek is also here today, who is now working alongside me directly in identifying and building some of the new growth platforms we anticipate within the OptumHealth portfolio. And that really speaks to - and let me just make it very specific comments to your questions there. We see a wide range of growth opportunities within the OptumHealth portfolio and with the OptumCare's portfolio specifically that really ranges from building out the debt in the major cities and conventions where we already have presence. And you'll see continued efforts to fill in those networks and to develop, essentially a coordinated network of care delivery in those cities. That's something, which you should expect to see on relentless ongoing basis. But, of course, we will also be looking at further extension of that network across the country through acquisition and elsewhere. And, obviously, when the DMG deal closes that will be a significant expansion of that in that very, very direct way. As literally quarter-by-quarter, I think we see more and more potential for the ambulatory network that we're building across the OptumCare portfolio. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the opening of our first cancer care center in Las Vegas this quarter, I think is just signaling all the direction I\u2019ll probably want to follow. Let me ask Dr. Wyatt Decker, just to may be add some specific thoughts from his position. Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Thank you, Andrew, and Sarah thank you for the question. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here with you this morning, and I can't tell you how please I am to have joined UnitedHealth Group. I have confident that there is no organization that is better positioned to create the future healthcare than this one. I would just add that OptumCare's vision for care is to create leading value-based patient centric physician health care system in the United States and we will do this through local markets where we can weave together the assets that Andrew has already touched on and we will do this through organic growth of our -- we're already in 36 markets. And if you include our MedExpress and ambulatory surgical centers, it would be 60 markets. We have 38,000 employed in affiliate physicians, and this will continue to grow organically as well as inorganically. But most exciting is what happens when you bring together, a value-based reimbursement system with a culture of commitment to patients and providers and layer on technology. And that's what we're committed to doing at - in OptumCare. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: Question really around just the broad risk membership segment. So commercial, Medicare, Medicaid and I know you don't typically update revenues of membership stayed with the quarters, but I guess other than the obvious Iowa exit. It is the broadly the risk membership numbers came in a little lower than we were expecting. Any changes to the outlook there by any of the segments? Or any color you can give in the individual areas?\nDavid Wichmann: Joshua, we typically don't update those particularly this early in the year. Steve Nelson, do you want to comment on growth overall and engage your team accordingly?\nSteve Nelson: May be just a few broad comments about UnitedHealthcare overall and how we think about growth? As you know we start with really strong market positions across all the businesses that you mentioned and have a history of the growth in those positions. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments that, that we're going to add over a million medical members this year and so great growth track record. Such as we look forward, our intention and our ambition is to continue to grow, grow those positions particularly as we think about some of the really strategic segments such as Medicare Advantage and build Special Needs Plans, where we have invested in capabilities and really strengthen our product offerings and some really innovative collaborations with Optum as well to really position ourselves to grow there not only this year, but continue to grow share as we look forward. Having said that, as you look across all the risks of different businesses, we are looking for long-term sustainable growth and so we do remain disciplined in our pricing and we're very intentional about where we grow and how we grow. And then that really just - I'll just end by saying that the path for growth for us is continued is a continued to focus on value and the products that we offer need to be innovative, they need to be directed towards, where the consumer needs our help. We are very adamant about driving a better experience, while we lower the cost and improve the outcomes. So we continue to be really bullish and optimistic about our growth opportunities, but we're going to be really thoughtful about it, and maybe I'd ask Dan to talk a little bit more about how that commercial for insured and some of the progress we\u2019re seeing there.\nDan Schumacher: As it relates to the commercial risk based enrollment, we had expected declines in the first quarter and that was largely driven by two public sector clients, and so similar to the enrollment pattern we experienced last year. We do expect to grow over the remaining quarters of the year. And inside the results, I'll tell you, we are growing in some markets and segments that are very important to us. And as Steve mentioned, we are very focused on increasing the value of our offerings. And we do that through a combination of some of the innovations you heard of earlier, deeper collaborations with high performing care providers, OptumCare as well as others, and also contributions from our multi-year multibillion dollar cost effort. So we feel well positioned. And then I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that, we're pleased with the results that we've driven on the self-funded side. We've had a very focused effort to return to growth and we did that nicely in the first quarter. We grew strongly on an organic basis, and we also supplemented that with some nice M&A as well. So overall, well positioned and feel good about it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: I want to delve into the MLR just a little bit and see if I could maybe roughly just tie out some numbers. So, MLR up about 60 basis points year-over-year, I think given the comments you made last \u2013 a year ago quarter about flu contributing about 50 basis points, it looks like MLR is maybe up 110 very in line with your guidance for the full year. But it still looks better than what we would estimate health insurance fee might push that number up roughly 140, and then government growing faster than commercial might be another 25 bps or so. So it still looks like, if I'm right, kind of an adjusted up 110 is still improving the real underlying trend primarily excluding the HIF. And I just wanted to see if those numbers sort of ballpark? And if so, where are you seeing sort of the true underlying improvement?\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks, Gary. John Rex.\nJohn Prince: Yes. Thanks, Gary. Good morning. So I'd start with the medical care ratio in the quarter it was in line with our expectations for the 1Q. I think you're correct in terms of the things you're seeing across that in terms of some of your observations that would create movement and such. I would point out in the 1Q one of the comments we made last quarter was around the workday content of 1Q 2019 versus 1Q 2018 having some impact which is one of the reasons we wanted to create some awareness around that. And that's just being calendar's fairly stable over the course of the year, but there are differences in quarters. And so when you have that content sometimes we would point that out. So we had one fewer weak day in the 1Q 2019 than 1Q 2018. The opposite affect occur is in 3Q this year. Actually, we have one more day in the 3Q 2019 than 3Q 2018. So no annual impact, it's just the quarterly timing how it flows across the year. So 1Q benefit 3Q gets that offsetting the weak day content that's where you expected this fall. That's really a\u2026\nGary Taylor: One clarification if I could. Since there's not much Medicaid growth this year which is usually much higher MLR is the MA enrollment growth, is that really any material effect on MLR in the guidance for the year?\nDavid Wichmann: No, I wouldn't call it material.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Just interested in your early thoughts on the Medicare outlook now for 2020 in terms of sustaining sort of the MA growth profile, now that we have the final rates visibility and sort of assuming that the HIF comes back next year. So maybe sort of thinking about sort of how you view the right outlook at this point on a net basis for 2020 an individual MA. And then maybe an update on how the group MA pipeline is shaping up for 2020 as well?\nDavid Wichmann: Brian Thompson.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks for the question Scott. First off, we're pleased with our growth year for the first quarter in 2019 and our positioning. As we have said before, we looked at 2019 because of long term view expecting for the potential headwind that return of the tax in 2020. As we're seeing the rates now, we're encouraged by the rate improvement that we've seen since the advanced notice, up about a point, but still not enough to cover the expected return of the health insurance tax. And I think that'll be pressure point industry wide. But what I can say to UnitedHealthcare in particular is that like I said, we went to market in 2019 with a long term view and expectant of this headwind. We're thoughtful and disciplined and intend to approach 2020 with the goal of keeping our benefits and our margins as stable as possible despite these headwinds. While at the same time driving continued growth like we have demonstrated now over the course of the last five to six years and improving our operating earnings overall. That's been the formula that we've executed against successfully and intend to do so again here in 2020. So optimistic about the outlook and are positioning here ending the first quarter 2019.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: You covered a lot of ground, maybe just one on the business combination announced today, if you could give us any color on that, maybe the revenue and earnings impact for the quarter and the year and whether that was contemplated in the prior 2019 guidance? That'll be helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: It's a very small acquisition, Steve, it's of an ASO based business or a self-funded business, about 630,000 lives, if I recall correctly. Relatively small purchase price, nice tuck-in acquisition, brings us a few new capabilities and technologies. But quite pleased to align with this company, but relatively small. And not really influencing our earnings expectations for the year.\nOperator: Next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: I just thought I'd ask about the PBM selling season for 2020. I assume we're well into that now. I think Andrew's comments about some early successes may be flush that out. I guess, there's two aspects to it I'd ask you about. You got more people that seem to be trying to pitch the synchronization strategies you guys have been doing for a while, is that changing the dynamics of the selling season in anyway? And then, I know a few years ago, the Health Transformation Alliance was a big discussion point. Those contracts sound like some of them may now be coming up for renewal. Does that present any challenges or opportunities for you?\nDavid Wichmann: Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Just before I ask John to comment more specifically about 2020. I think what we are seeing is, some of the benefits of a very substantial amount of innovation around our offering design that John and his team have been developing, partly in anticipation of changes in the policy environment that obviously been touched on already in this call conversation, but also taking advantage of technology and other levers that have been brought alongside the traditional core PBM of OptumRx. I think it's that combination of all of those things, really, leaning into exploring value-based propositions and really being extremely dynamic in the way in which we start to bring to bear some of these different tools that has created a very competitive set of offerings. Let me ask John just to describe you how that's landing for us this year and projected for next year.\nJohn Prince: Jay, it's John Prince. In terms of our 2020 selling season it is still early, but we have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities. We've already had some really good wins for 2020. We've sold several large health plans. They stayed in a variety of large employers. Two good examples that -- of large wins already was the Hubbard program announcement and of our partnership in early January. They selected us because of our partnership around total cost of care, clinical outcomes, consumer experience sort of resonating, what Andrew Witty just mentioned, around our innovation around the consumer and clinical outcomes. Another example of a good win for 2020 is, with HealthTrust and their division for CoreTrust, they selected OptumRx as their exclusive pharmacy care services provider to improve the performance of healthcare. We'll be their key strategic channel partner for health systems in Fortune 2000 companies. In the overall market, you asked around, our value story, I think, our value proposition is resonating their market. Others might be now using the same vocabulary as we have, but we've been working at this for five years. We continue to modernize our offering, continue to innovate around outcomes and also we continued to expand the services that we have to support unique communities and partnerships. And I think that's also a differentiation for us in the market. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: It's a great question. What you're seeing there is a innovation and play, starting with synchronization, but really the development of a modern, much more modern pharmacy care services business that continues to stay out of the marketplace and is really responding to the needs of employers, health plans, and others out there and seeing the growth as a result.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAna Gupte: My question was about Telehealth, I think I saw a sort of national TV ads on Virtual Health UnitedHealthcare. I was wondering if you could comment on what your strategy is, is this mostly for urgent care or is it also belongs to panic care management. So, is that differ by pair mix and how are you preparing for the CMS inclusion of the Telehealth in the bundle and then can you talk about how this dovetails with your OptumCare strategy of MedExpress and employed physicians -- thinking any single vendor or multi-vendor contracts or anything?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Ana. Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Ana thanks so much for the question. So, I think Telehealth is an interesting potential ingredient for how we think about delivering improved outcome and value for patients and customers within our OptumCare's environment. But I think really the central -- so, I think the really central part is to ensure that we have a really, really strong integrated physical engagement with patients as a core platform. That needs to be very much empowered by information, clinical insight, and needs to be real-time. So, that's very much with we are building. I think then wrapped around that, we envision substantial portfolios of digital engagement and also platform such as Telehealth. But I think on their own, they have relatively limited runway, frankly. I think as a component or as an ingredient of a much more comprehensive care delivery platform, which is what we envisioned, clearly a role, but very much alongside what you're seeing has developed within the OptumCare's environment, very much patient-centric, very much focused on the best possible clinical outcome, focused on the best possible patient experience at the lowest possible cost. We think that is a strategy, which will require modern technologies, innovative technologies like Telehealth, but it fundamentally will be built around the physician-led physical engagement of the patient.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, just had a question on medical cost trend and just general kind of medical cost performance for the first quarter. Can you just talk a little about how it's tracking to the guidance you guys have given? And in particular, are you seeing better than expected results on the pharmacy side as well as anything else offsetting that?\nDavid Wichmann: I assume you're referring to commercial Lance?\nLance Wilkes: Yes, I was thinking about your commercial medical cost trend target of 6%.\nDavid Wichmann: Dan?\nDan Schumacher: Sure, good morning Lance. I would tell you that our medical cost in the quarter were very much in line with our expectation and on track as we look to the full year. That's 6% plus or minus 50 basis points. Frankly, I wouldn't call out anything as being different than what we had expected coming in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Ransom: We attempted to kill some trees last week and tease out some of the organic growth numbers from the acquired growth. The number that was astounding to me at least was that we calculated the mid-teens organic growth at OptumHealth, which as you know would be 3x the organic growth of any kind of stand-alone services providers that's track publicly. So I was wondering, if you could just give us some help as to how you get to those numbers that are frankly 3x anything else we see out there in the stand-alone market? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: It's compelling growth platform. And it's doing exactly what we had hoped and designed it to do. Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Yes, I mean listen, John thanks so much for the question. I think what you'll see within OptumHealth is really a whole series of self reinforcing very complementary growth drivers all beginning to kick in together. And I think the leadership team, Andrew Hayek's leadership team now led by Dr. Wyatt Decker, I think deserve a lot of credit for bringing on stream all of these various activities. As you look across, you're seeing geographic growth; we're seeing a greater shift of physician groups to value. We're seeing those physician groups deliver great quality of clinical care, a better cost. That -- making those practices more attractive for membership clearly. And as you think through, you can layer on level after level and each of them kind of amplify the growth velocity of the business. So we feel very good about the track record that this business is the delivering. Honestly, I think it was still in the very early days of the evolution of the OptumHealth and OptumCare's business you\u2019ll see substantial degrees of innovation over the next year or two. We've got significant ambitions for layer in on and developing the Rally platform for example alongside the OptumCare platform. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, things like the OptumCare cancer center begins to open up yet another dimension and the work that Andrew Hayek is now leading alongside me directly to look at further expansion points for the OptumHealth, OptumCare's agenda. So early days, we feel good about where we are so far. Very clearly a function of many streams of work beginning to gear together very positively.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. Just expect us to continue to invest in this category and we're talking five to 10 years out to build this health system that has the capacity to make a real difference on outcomes quality and patient experience and costs frankly, delivering really strong\u2026\nJohn Ransom: If you can permit me a follow-up. How much of it is the move where the primary care doctor goes from getting $0.05, $0.10 on $1 to getting the full dollar. Is that bigger than a mousetrap in terms of the overall growth? Or is that just a small piece of it?\nAndrew Witty: John, a key part. I mean, as you know a key part of the philosophy of how we\u2019re developing OptumCare is exactly that journey and we believe that's very important. We see repeatedly that that helps facilitate and free up physicians to make great decisions on behalf of their patients, ensure the best care is delivered with the best possible cost. So yes that's a key part of the journey, and it's certainly a part of philosophy of how we run that set of clinics, yes.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee: I just want to get a clarification, Dave because there's some headline that came across regarding your commentary about the Medicaid business. I recall hearing earlier you saying that, you expect to get your target margins by 2020, but headlines are coming across saying probably take us 2022. Can you just clarify what you had said earlier?\nDavid Wichmann: Our expectation is that we'll be in the zone of our target margins probably closer to the bottom end of that in 2020.\nCharles Rhyee: And my question was actually, if I could ask my question around points of rebates. You guys had mentioned not just you, but all the PBM's in general that point-of-sale rebates have been available to the employer market for some time \u2013 it just wasn't really an appetite for it. You guys are now making decision to move ahead in the commercial market with this kind of strategy. Does this put you at risk here that employers aren\u2019t going to be still that attracted to this type of model as you move forward?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. It's possible that that would be the case. But for situations where consumers are exposed to high inflation or list prices of drugs, we think it's important that discounts are applied at the point of service. And so we believe that that's the proper plan design. Again, where there is a high-deductible health plan or there is other benefit designs that we've patients exposed. So, again, we're seeing as much as a 16% improvement and adherence. And we believe the long-term health effects for the people we serve will be substantial as a result. So we think we're doing the right thing for people and if that means, we have to offer designs that are more restrictive we will. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nZach Sopcak: To that last point do you think the adherence by the Fed and improvement in cost that you're seeing in your commercial book is translatable to Medicare? Or do you think you would get more leverage just given a general sicker population?\nDavid Wichmann: Theoretically, yes, we believe so. We'd like to see it prove out over time, but we'd probably expect the benefits in the Medicare population to be more immediate than you might see in a \u2013 in a commercial population. Thanks for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Willoughby: Just one point of clarification and then a question. The point of clarification just on 2020 selling season comments, is there any way to quantify where you're thinking your positioning might be in terms of a net basis going in for next year on the PBM business? And then my question was just on Duals and if you could just provide a little bit more color on the importance of Duals to your growth, what you're seeing so far this year and where you expect that to go over the rest of this year and next year? Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. Steve, we're not going to comment on 2020 at this stage. But we can answer the Duals question. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. The Duals, you mean, the Duals special needs program as you know UnitedHealthcare has been in this space and growing and growing strong results over 30% of the market today. But we really invest in the Duals special needs program is because we see that it's really the best for our consumers. It\u2019s the aligned benefits, care coordination that our members cannot get from Medicaid or Medicare alone, and often they get supplemental benefits on top of that. So as we continue to see alignment with states and the federal government to make this program even better. It's a place we're going to continue to invest. We had another strong year in 2018 as you know the quarter, first quarter we saw strong growth in this again, and we think that's really our experience. Our Medicaid footprint our unique programs through Optum like our HouseCalls program and our strong brand and service surgical specialty. So this will be an area see us continue to invest and we expect a strong growth again this year in 2019.\nOperator: We'll take our question from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Newshel: Also quickly on the tax rate. It was close to the full-year guidance, but in the past, the first quarter has been lower due to stock comp expense timing. So is there any change in seasonality this year or any change to expectations for the full-year tax rate?\nDavid Wichmann: John?\nJohn Prince: It's John Rex. No change in our full year outlook I would say in terms of the 1Q. And there was a little reduced impact from a share based exercise benefit, as you realize that has impact that typically why the 1Q trends lower than other quarters, because there's more activity there. And there was just the volume of exercise that was just a little bit lighter and that's probably likely due to share price fluctuation but that was it.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Michael. Are there any questions remaining?\nOperator: We have one question remaining on the line.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay.\nOperator: From Matthew Borsch with BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Borsch: I'll make this quick you've been very, very patient going through all the questions. Just curious to ask at this stage of the game, are you concerned that you'll be loading a lot on price going into 2020? And clearly the industry fee assuming that comes back is going to be something that was out of pricing that's going to come back into pricing in 2020. But you've also got maybe something to add on to pricing with the PBM change or maybe not take to your pricing, but the employers do effectively if they're not using the rebate to reduce employee side premiums. Is that going to be a factor as you're going into next year?\nDavid Wichmann: Matt. Good question. I think as you know we're already have converted or we're in process of converting the $8 million fully-insured commercialize to move to point-of-sale rebates, so that consideration has already played out for the most part overall. I think Brian talked earlier about how he has positioned a multi-year strategy and very important commentary from him about maintaining benefits stability and maintaining margins through the 2020 time period here recognizing that there is some friction on rising cost structures overall. And I don't really see a meaningful impact on our self-funded market either from the modification that we've made on point-of-sale announced earlier this year. The thing I am concerned about is the return of the health insurance tax in 2020. That will increase the cost to health care by at least $20 billion for 142 million people. And if you do the math on that that increased premiums for a senior couple by $500 dollars and for families with small business coverage by about the same amount. And that outcome from our standpoint is entirely unacceptable. The healthcare already costs too much in these unnecessary taxes layered on top of what is already in high-cost health system is just untenable. So we continue to pursue a deferral, if not an outright repeal on behalf of those we serve. We can't comment on or speculate on the outcome at this stage where we're operating as if the law is the law. And that there is no deferral, but we certainly hope and will continue to advocate aggressively on behalf of the consumers we serve to keep these healthcare costs in check.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, great. Well, thank you. To sum up our discussion today UnitedHealth Group began 2019 with strong operational and financial performance from both the Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We achieved this robust performance by increasing the healthcare value we deliver to people every day, providing more affordable higher quality healthcare, while improving patient and care provider satisfaction. As an innovative technology enabled healthcare company, the value we offer society is rising at an accelerating pace. In turn, we expect to continue to grow, serving more people in more ways across the U.S. and worldwide. Thank you for joining us. This concludes our call.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 20, 2021, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We remain in a time of unprecedented challenges for individuals, employers, and the health system broadly, particularly frontline clinicians, including our own. Health systems across the world have been and continue to be stressed. Amidst these challenges, we are grateful for the daily displays of human spirit to serve others and the resolve to make things better. We remain optimistic because we are also living at a time of unprecedented collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation. The health system has come together in ways previously not seen, a powerful multi-dimensional response to support patients, physicians, and communities. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of or more grateful to the more than 325,000 women and men of this enterprise. They work each day under difficult conditions with clinicians comprising well more than a third of the total. To advance a high performing healthcare system, one built on personal human connections enabled through information and technology and supported by strong alignment of physician-led, value-based delivery of care. They are another profound reason for our optimism. With all that\u2019s transpired in 2020, we finished the year responsibly and strongly. We delivered meaningful advances in NPS and employee engagement and financial results well above the upper end of our expectations, all while navigating the uncertain environment and achieving our commitment to address financial imbalances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we move into 2021, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to serve more people even more deeply and more effectively, while continuing to build this enterprise and grow strongly in the decades to come. Just 7 weeks ago, we were privileged to spend a full day with you at our investor conference. Over the course of that day, we tried to convey how we seek to lead in the development of the next generation healthcare system. We shared the distinctive capabilities we apply to make healthcare more connected, more informed, more human, and more deeply personal. We finished 2020 encouraged by the performance across the businesses of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Let me provide just a few broad highlights. The UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage offerings are off to an excellent start. 2021 will be one of our strongest years of growth, now expected to approach 900,000 more people served across individual and group Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans. UnitedHealthcare will have grown to serve 3.5 million more seniors over 5 years. Seniors choose our offerings because of the value they receive, better health outcomes and experiences at lower costs. We have also been enhancing our offerings to better meet expectations about how people want to live their lives, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our one-on-one concierge navigation services, and enabling the home as the safest and more effective setting of care. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicaid offerings continued to grow strongly as well, including entry into three new states in 2021. New business opportunities are substantial with momentum towards managed care adoption by states and RFP activity accelerating this year and next. And while the economic effects of COVID-19 impacted UnitedHealthcare\u2019s employer-sponsored growth in 2020, we are encouraged by the positive market response to the new highly consumer-centric offerings we have been discussing with you in recent months. Among these are digital first, on-demand, and physician-led products each provide deeply aligned modern, personal, and coordinated-care experiences and save people up to 20% compared to traditional offerings. These innovative products are generating significant responses because they are designed to better meet the unique needs and financial needs of more people. All-in, we expect UnitedHealthcare will grow in 2021 to serve upwards of 1.5 million more people across its senior community, employer-sponsored, and individual offerings. We continue to make important advancements and strategic investments to lay the foundation for the next generation health system. Over the last many years, you have heard us discuss our ambition to build high performing systems of care, including an aim to reinvent healthcare delivery, which is the first of our five strategic growth platforms. The foundations for those efforts are in our primary and multi-specialty care practices. OptumCare entered 2021 with over 50,000 physicians and 1,400 clinics. Over the course of this year, we expect to grow our employed and affiliated physicians by at least 10,000. This work of building local physician-led systems of care continues to be central to our mission and is accelerating with notable progress in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and Southern California in 2020. Two weeks ago, we announced the combination of Change Healthcare and OptumInsight. We expect this combination will greatly advance the foundational connectivity and collaboration needed for the next-generation health system, establishing a new, more modern information, and technology-enabled healthcare platform. It will help accelerate the development and use of digital and advanced technologies, another of our five key growth platforms and critical to connecting all elements of our business strategy. This advanced platform will help clinicians make the most informed and clinically advanced patient care decisions more quickly and easily. Change Healthcare brings widely adopted technology for integrating evidence-based clinical criteria directly into the clinician\u2019s workflow, while Optum\u2019s clinical analytics expertise and individual health record can strengthen the evidence base needed to deliver effective clinical decision support at the point of care. This can ensure appropriate clinical pathways are offered in the most appropriate sites of care, leading to consistent achievement of the best possible outcomes experiences and value for the patients we serve. Another key opportunity will be to enhance administrative processes by combining Optum\u2019s advanced data analytics with Change Healthcare\u2019s intelligent healthcare network to support simpler, more informed, and accurate services and processing at considerably lower costs. Finally, combining Change Healthcare\u2019s payment capacities with Optum\u2019s highly automated payment networks will simplify financial interactions among care providers, payers, and consumers and accelerate the movement to a more modern, real-time, and transparent payment system. This will help physicians get paid more quickly, accurately, and reliably and provide consumers with more options and convenience and managing their healthcare finances. The Change Healthcare team has been doing outstanding work and we are looking forward to working alongside them. We continue to execute on the core initiatives we laid out for you in December. One example as the pandemic disrupted care patterns, we all saw the increased need to enhance in-home and alternative settings of care offering patients to receive safe, effective, and efficient care outside of traditional venues. However, the need for in-home care will continue to grow well beyond the current environment. We know that more than 80% of what impacts a person\u2019s health happens outside of traditional healthcare settings. There is a significant opportunity in offering consistent cost-effective care for seniors, people with complex medical conditions and geographically isolated individuals through in-home and alternative settings. Offering a foundational ability to care for people in their homes is essential to developing a health system that is more consumer centric, higher quality, and lower cost. We already have well established trusted capacities to bring skilled care resources into the home, including through Optum\u2019s HouseCalls program. We expect our advanced practice clinicians will conduct over 2 million in-home visits this year. And we are building upon this established home capacity in many ways. We have introduced Vivify remote patient monitoring capabilities to improve connectivity and information sharing with physicians. This has been received positively by patients with a net promoter score over 80. Optum At-Home provides in-person and telephonic touch points across an interdisciplinary team, including physical, social and behavioral aspects. The program increases preventative care, achieves exceptional NPS in the mid-80s, lowers medical expense and demonstrates high quality with over 90% of our members in a 4-star or higher plan. Similarly, Optum\u2019s Pharmacy Care Services enables patients to receive the care and medications they need with capacities to deliver outside of traditional settings. OptumRx infusion services now addresses the needs of about 25,000 patients per month and is growing double-digits, which means more patients can obtain the care they need outside of the acute settings. That makes it safer, simpler and more affordable for people. We remain encouraged as well by the traditional pharmacy services provided by OptumRx with an over 98% customer retention rate entering 2021. We are off to a good start for the 2022 selling season as we were recently awarded the honor to serve more than 2.5 million members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. In sum, we enter 2021 with momentum, competent in our capacities to navigate through and begin to emerge from these challenging times as an even more capable, diverse and growing enterprise. Now, I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dave. The full year 2020 and fourth quarter results were favorable to the outlook we provided at our December 1 investor conference, while continuing to be impacted by the unprecedented environment which has existed most of the year. To begin, as we know it is of great interest to you, I\u2019d like to share what we are seeing in current care patterns. Starting at the highest level within the broad member categories we serve, people with commercial benefits continue to exhibit overall higher levels of care activity with less deferrals and those served in public sector programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our top priority remains getting people the care they need. During the fourth quarter, we saw overall average care activities return to seasonal baselines compared to the just over 95% we cited for the third quarter. The pacing over the course of the quarter, perhaps not too surprisingly, moved from just below baseline as we began to modestly exceeding baseline in the latter half. This measure includes increased direct COVID-19 related care, which in total comprised about 11% of all care activity during the fourth quarter compared to about 6% in the third quarter. Looking deeper within specific care categories, outpatient activity began the quarter at baseline and we were gratified people were able to obtain needed care previously deferred. By the latter part of the quarter however, some outpatient activity moderated as COVID-19 incidence elevated. Total in-patient activity increased modestly over the course of the quarter as the direct COVID-19 related care components rose as a percentage of the total in the latter half. For example, of the 65,000 COVID-19 related in-patient admissions during the quarter, about 20% occurred October and about 50% in December. Moving into our specific businesses, OptumHealth\u2019s fourth quarter earnings increased 16% year-over-year as care activity at our fee-for-service practices and ambulatory surgery centers continue to recover with these businesses now operating near baseline. Revenue for consumers served grew 29% over the year ago quarter. The growth in this measure reflects continued development of the value based care arrangements, the depth of our offerings and the increasing acuity of the types of care we can deliver to the people we serve. You should expect this measure to continue to grow at a strong double-digit pace for many years to come. One example which highlights this potential, of the 20 million patients OptumCare serves to-date under 20% are currently in value-based arrangements. We expect both the number of patients served and the depth and number of value-based arrangements to continue to accelerate. OptumInsight\u2019s earnings were ahead of the outlook we offered at the beginning of December, with overall 2020 performance impacted by lower levels of care with revenues dependent upon care activity volumes for many of these businesses and the generally subdued overall business environment. We continue to expect 10% to 15% growth in 2021 as care activity returns to normalized levels and we continue to advance strategic relationships and broaden services with existing customers. This outlook excludes any impact from OptumInsight\u2019s combination with Change Healthcare, which we expect will close in the second half of the year. OptumRx earnings were also ahead of this outlook. During 2020, revenues in our pharmacy care services and specialty businesses continue to grow at double-digits and now comprise nearly half of total OptumRx revenue. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, fourth quarter operating results were above our December review. They reflect continued customer and provider assistance measures to help people obtain the care they need and comparatively lower levels of care deferrals and higher COVID-19 care costs versus the third quarter. Results in the fourth quarter were further impacted by additional reserves or rebates and related activity as plans with such arrangements moved into these positions as a result of the cumulative care deferral impacts throughout 2020 and calendar year end assessments were concluded. As Dave noted, sales activity in the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period was robust. Within the 900,000 new members we expect to serve for full year 2021, about 775,000 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans, which are included in the community and state Medicaid membership tables. Strong growth in Medicaid membership continued in the fourth quarter. We call our full year 2021 outlook to serve an additional 200,000 to 300,000 people, assumed state re-determination activities are reinitiated during the year. We concluded 2020 with commercial membership about 100,000 people ahead of the outlook we provided at our investor conference. Early January results are well supportive of positive commercial growth in 2021, this even considering the challenging economic environment. Our liquidity, capital positions and capacities remained strong. Full year 2020 cash flows from operations were $22.2 billion or 1.4x net income with the fourth quarter results exceeding the outlook we provided due in part to early customer receipts. Our debt to total capital ratio of 38.9% compares to 40.2% last year. As we look enthusiastically toward the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our longstanding capital policies, including our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platforms and ongoing priority on expanding our local care delivery capabilities. Our full year 2021 outlook remains consistent with the early December commentary, with total revenue approaching $280 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $17.75 to $18.25, inclusive of the negative COVID-19 related effects we described. Given the still highly dynamic circumstances, we will likely hold this broader than typical range of expectations as we much like everyone else, continue to learn more about the environment. Now, I will turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. As you can tell, the businesses of this diversified and growing enterprise remains strong and well-positioned for sustained, balanced growth as we continue to add new capabilities and market positions. We remain committed to our mission and an intense focus on serving one person at a time at increasing levels of value, more affordable, better outcomes and improved experiences, while generating strong returns for you, our shareholders. Operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to some of the commentary. You said trends are near baseline. Just wanted to be clear are you talking about just utilization or spending there? And then the commentary that COVID was 11% of activity, I guess in the fourth quarter. Just want to clarify that.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thanks, Ralph. John?\nJohn Rex: Ralph, yes. So, we\u2019re talking about spending. When we talk about near-baseline levels anticipated and again inclusive of the COVID-19 care costs. So, that\u2019s why I was trying to give you some sense of kind of what component those, what those comprise in there, overall. And your second question, Ralph, I lost just the last part of it. I just want to make sure I heard that.\nDavid Wichmann: I\u2019m afraid he may have cut out.\nJohn Rex: Yes. I didn\u2019t hear quite the very end of it. But when we\u2019re talking about kind of the 11% zone, I think maybe what you were looking for is probably how that relates. Think of that 11% zone in terms of medical costs. If you\u2019re looking at our medical costs on our income statement, I\u2019d use about maybe three quarters of that level as a measure. What I would exclude from that, because we\u2019re thinking about really kind of components, fee-for-service medical costs, but we incur on that. So, it would include UnitedHealthcare\u2019s payments to capitated providers \u2013 it would exclude, sorry. It would also exclude things like pharmacy costs and such. So, I\u2019d probably use about three quarters of that, and I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re going with that question. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, Ralph, if we didn\u2019t get that, just circle back with the team, and we\u2019ll be happy to answer your question [indiscernible]. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. You recently updated your telehealth policies, wanted to dig a little bit deeper into this. What do you think is sort of the right balance between in-person medical care versus telehealth when activity normalizes? And when do you think \u2013 where do you think reimbursement will settle? It seems that you are continuing sort of the imperative reimbursement, but as you think about --?\nDavid Wichmann: Ricky, you cut out about the same time Ralph did, so we\u2019ll take a shot at answering your question around telehealth policies and how we think this will normalize out. Actually, I\u2019ll ask Dirk to do that and maybe ask Dr. Decker to talk about the pluses and minuses \u2013 not pluses and minuses but just maybe when more in-patient care should be administered versus digital.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. So thanks, Dave. What I would say is the good news is that telehealth is a great vehicle for people to access care. So, number one, let\u2019s just start with that as a premise. We at UnitedHealthcare, from a policy standpoint, we work with Optum, we work with a lot of telehealth providers on different products and capabilities, and I would say how it\u2019s ultimately going to shake out is going to be related to who provides the best outcome using telehealth, the lowest costs, and ultimately the best patient experience. Those are sort of truisms which are going to exist no matter what. We saw a huge spike at the beginning of real high telehealth access back in April. It sort of metered out throughout the course of the year. I\u2019m not sure where it\u2019s going to ultimately end, but clearly it\u2019s here to stay and it\u2019s going to be an important part of healthcare going forward.\nDavid Wichmann: Dr. Decker?\nWyatt Decker: Yes, thanks, Dave and Dirk. And Ricky, thanks for the question. What\u2019s fascinating is not all telehealth offerings are created equal, and we have found that not surprisingly patients really appreciate being connected to their own personal providers, and providers very much need the real-time clinical data to provide good advice and care for that patient in a virtual setting. So, that\u2019s key point one. Point two is certain services like ambulatory or outpatient behavioral health care lends themselves to a telehealth solution, and so we have seen approximately 50% of our behavioral healthcare being delivered in a telehealth setting, and that has been sustained throughout the year even as the pandemic had subsided, and as it returns, it empowers those populations to get excellent care virtually. Finally, I\u2019ll just add that it\u2019s critical and we\u2019re very excited about the ability at OptumHealth to connect physical care, virtual care, and home-based care in a comprehensive model that really differentiates itself by providing personal, real-time care in the right setting. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Dr. Decker and Dirk. Thank you for your question, Ricky. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess as you now assess the commercial membership trends exiting 2020 and any early trends so far in 2021, is there any further color just on your conviction around the commercial enrollment projections for 2021, as you would now need a small increase in commercial risk membership to hit the target this year and then whereas fee-based rates would remain essentially flat, just looking for more color around that? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Steven, a good question. And I\u2019d just like to throw in a plug for our commercial team that has worked very hard to get cost structures in line and to be very innovative around new product offerings, bring greater value to people, and I think it\u2019s starting to show through in terms of our overall growth performance. Bill, do you want to comment, respond to Steven directly?\nBill Golden: Yes. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start with we\u2019re really pleased with how our fourth quarter and January 2021 enrollment performance played out. Our enrollment for one-one [ph] is better than we projected at our investor conference, supported by really strong persistency across really all lines of coverage and then less than anticipated attrition. Obviously, in the current economic environment, it\u2019s created some challenges. However, we\u2019re really well-positioned to deliver on our commercial growth strategy that we highlighted at our Investor Day. I think we\u2019ve also benefited from a broad portfolio of products that all of our customers are accessing to renew their business with us. So, we feel really nice \u2013 we feel really strong about our growth prospects for the rest of 2021. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: I\u2019d just say we have a ways to go. We\u2019re kind of turning the corner to growth, and obviously maintaining that consistently and continuing to accelerate it will be our emphasis as we move forward. Thank you for the question, Steven. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Good morning. Could you just talk a little bit in OptumRx about the pace and status for you guys in online pharmacy and in-home delivery? And maybe what your long-term strategy and scope is for that?\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Happy to. John Prince?\nJohn Prince: Thanks for the question, Lance. Obviously we\u2019ve been very focused on building our pharmacy care services model for the last several years. So not only have we been getting into online pharmacy and home delivery but we\u2019ve been creating various programs to meet the needs of populations especially in infusion and pharmacies. And why we frame that is because we\u2019re trying to meet the needs of the population in unique ways and create a very differentiated solution. So I think as you look at online pharmacy and home delivery, it\u2019s been a big grower for us. We\u2019ve continued to grow share, expand our penetration, but we\u2019ve also expanded our services within pharmacy care services to serve all consumers so that they don\u2019t have to be a member of the PBM. We\u2019ve been launching over-the-counter Optum Store, and so we see a significant growth of selling more products. We also will see in those stores unique ones like Optum Perks, which is our discount card of bringing them all together in a virtual environment. So we see good prospects, and we see as a big grower in the long-term.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Lance. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Willoughby: Hi. Good morning. Just a question regarding one of the lines in the press release this morning related to additional reserves for rebates related to activity as calendar year assessments were concluded. Just wondering if you could provide anymore color on that? And anyway to quantify that as compared to the larger, favorable reserve development you experienced during the quarter, anything else interesting on reserves and movements one way or another? Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Sure, Steve. John Rex here. I would say, additional color I could provide on that is kind of those actions well more than offset the magnitude of favorable reserve development in the quarter and just as those moved into those positions. Not too surprisingly, as you can tell, because we were able to, as we provide an outlook in December for the full year and how things would turn out, given the greater level of volatility in specific pieces of business over this course of this year as utilization moved around over the quarter, so thereby putting more plans into those kind of positions than one would of course normally have. Part of what one would have to anticipate in this kind of environment but certainly kind of that move. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Steve. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Had a question just on your latest thinking and expectations just around Medicaid risk corridors and the impact that you\u2019re expecting there. Just interested if the impact of corridors completed in the fourth quarter in line with the expectations that you provided at Investor Day, and whether there\u2019s been any incremental changes there since then in terms of expansion of corridor programs and how you think about that on Medicaid margins. One of your competitors had recently cited a larger than expected impact in 4Q, so wanted to get your feedback on that. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. We\u2019ll send that to Tim Spilker. Tim?\nTim Spilker: Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. States have continued to leverage risk corridors and MLR structures, and many of these were implemented in the back half of \u201820. We anticipated those based on discussions with our customers. One thing that should be noted is that looking ahead CMS has implemented rules requiring corridors to be implemented proactively versus retrospectively, so that will improve some predictability and visibility. And then overall, just in terms of what we\u2019re seeing at this point, while most of our one-one base rate renewals are in line with expectations, we\u2019re really respectful of the financial pressure that many of our states are under as well as the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. So we\u2019ll continue to work with our customers and advocate for sustainable funding in that regard. So thanks for the question.\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Scott. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quickies on post the Investor Day. It sounds like you\u2019re saying that cost trend picked up through the quarter a bit. Can you talk about it relative to what you\u2019re expecting for the full year 2021? Is it ahead of where you\u2019re expecting or in line? And then Medicare physician rates went up a bit post the Stimulus Bill. I\u2019ve estimated it about $0.15 of a headwind for the company. Just curious on your estimate there. And are there any offsets that you see as you are going through the year? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Why don\u2019t we hand the first part to John Rex, and then Tim will handle the second.\nJohn Rex: Justin, I\u2019d say the outlook for 2021 in terms of COVID impact, though even with what you\u2019ve cited there in terms of as things were trending in the quarter still consistent with where we were at Investor Conference. And our expectation is that total direct COVID-19 care costs in 2021 will be similar to what we experienced for full year 2020. So there isn\u2019t anything that would take us off that view right now. I think the other element we cited though, total COVID-19 care costs higher, and then the headwind being that care deferral likely being meaningfully lower than we saw in 2020.\nDavid Wichmann: And, Tim, second part?\nTim Spilker: Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. So the fee schedule increase that you talked about was of course part of the relief deal that was passed on December 20. And the physician fee schedule increase that was included there was partially offset by removing sequester for the first quarter of 2021. As we look at this environment, it\u2019s obviously still quite fluid. The PHE has been extended again and obviously also another relief package that\u2019s being worked on. At this time, the sequester relief has only been extended a quarter and does not match the PHE as it has throughout the pandemic, and if sequester was extended one more quarter, that would offset the small headwind that we\u2019re seeing as a result of all of this. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re still watching, but that\u2019s where it stands.\nDavid Wichmann: Good observation on puts and takes that\u2019s going to probably happen as we navigate our way through 2021. That\u2019s why we have a wider range, and we have a $2 billion estimate on net COVID impacts as well. Thanks for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. Maybe just to shift over to OptumHealth, I noticed you announced a fairly sizable physician group acquisition in Massachusetts. And if I heard you correctly, I believe you said you expect employed and affiliated physicians to increase around 10,000 this year. I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the acquisition environment for doc groups. Are you finding a greater willingness in this kind of COVID, post-COVID world for a willingness to consider acquisitions for some of these larger groups?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. Just before we get started, we have not announced any acquisition, as you described. So that\u2019s a market rumor and speculation. As it relates to M&A broadly in this space, Doctor Decker and the team have done a terrific job continuing to build in the Northeast. I\u2019d say in the fourth quarter the [indiscernible] transaction was completed, and that is a strong addition to our I-95 corridor Tri-State expectation. We also finished an acquisition in the Southwest in Southern California, in particular, with the Inland Empire region, and we\u2019ve also done some work up in the Pacific Northwest this past year as well and some in the center part of the United States. I\u2019d say, generally speaking, the market seems to continue to gravitate towards an OptumCare-type model where there\u2019s a great sense of stability as well as a very strong quadruple aim model, which seems to resonate very well with physicians but also with our patients where they get better experiences, outcomes, and overall lower costs as demonstrated by the value that\u2019s being brought every day and the growth of that overall in that area. So I think as we turn into 2021 this will be an area of continued focus for us, and I think you\u2019ll continue to see that occur over the next half to full decade or so as we continue to build out this broad health system that\u2019s much more effective across the four aims that I just described. Thank you for your question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from UBS. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey. Thanks. You guys have really emphasized some of the new innovative solutions in commercial, the consumer-centric focus, etcetera. Can you talk maybe more about the on-demand solutions that you\u2019ve been referencing and the partnership with buying just the receptivity among planned sponsors? Just curious if there\u2019s been any sort of surprises in the market as you\u2019ve kind of brought that capability to your customer base.\nDavid Wichmann: Bill, do you want to take that one?\nBill Golden: Yes, sure. I\u2019ll start with we benefit from a broad portfolio of products and plan designs across our business, and depending on the type of buyer we\u2019ve seen great interest in all different types of products for us. So we have seen a big uptick in our motion product, people looking for digital solutions, looking for activity trackers. There\u2019s been a huge amount of emphasis and discussion with employers regarding access to better wellness obviously because of the pandemic, and so we\u2019ve seen a lot of receptivity to that. We\u2019ve seen a lot of receptivity to our All Savers product. As far as Bind, Yes. For a particular type of buyer it\u2019s really been a very interesting, innovative solution. We continue to bring that to market, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunities that we\u2019ll deliver in our fully-insured market as well as in our ASO business for Bind. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: And if I can, I\u2019m just going to have Dan Schumacher on the Bind board also comment on what he\u2019s seeing with the overall progression there.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thank you. Whit, appreciate the interest. We have seen broad market interest in Bind. I\u2019d say that as you look at what happened over the course of 2020, more people were inclined to stay, so there was less switching going on. You saw that in the broader UnitedHealthcare performance in terms of retention. So on the new sales side, we saw probably lower interest than we would have hoped just given the tendency towards incumbency, but where we had an existing footprint we continued to see employees choose Bind inside those offerings. So we are excited about the prospects forward and expect to build on it especially as we return to more normal buying patterns in the future.\nDavid Wichmann: The progressive model that will continue to evolve and adapt over time like the initial price points and the impact, I also like the receptivity broadly by consumers, which I would say has probably been the greatest surprise for me, personally, is that consumers get it as well as they do. So, I think that\u2019s part of the reason why you have seen strong receptivity in the market overall. Thanks for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning, here with Eric as well. My question relates to OptumHealth and you show the 98 million consumers served in 2020 and the average revenue per consumer at $34. I think, John, you mentioned that was up close to 30%, but that\u2019s still a fraction of the opportunity of how we think about a traditional risk-bearing capitation rate. So the question really is what percentage of the OptumHealth revenues are sort of pure fee-for-service? What about \u2013 what\u2019s the percentage on the other end of the spectrum sort of global capitation and how do we think about what\u2019s in the middle, really just trying to see where that number can get to over time?\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex will answer and then I want Dr. Decker to maybe talk a little bit about the evolution from fee-for-service to risk.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Josh and Eric. John Rex here. So, looking at that, looking at that membership, so you are right in terms of where it is risk-based. Let me frame it from a very top level first, about two-thirds of overall OptumHealth revenue is risk-bearing revenue and we have sized before that you think of that as two-thirds of OptumCare also on risk-bearing relationships. If you want to get down to kind of the levels within OptumCare, there are 20 million members that are served by OptumCare of that 94 million that you are referring to. And then within that 20 million, 3.4 million are in some kind of risk-bearing relationship and then a smaller percentage in that in a true global capped relationship, I\u2019d put well below half of that 3.4 million in a global cap relationship. So you are right and one of the reasons we were, I was speaking to that in my prepared comments, is because of that opportunity. There is a comparatively small amount of the total membership potential that is currently in a global cap relationship. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the growth of OptumHealth and OptumCare. It comes down to its primarily an organic revenue growth story, because when we affiliate with physician groups, typically those come in, many of them come in largely fee-for-service arrangements and then we seek to convert those to risk arrangements or with more accountability, more value-based care over several years. And so when you look at kind of the overall revenue growth story of that company, it is predominantly organic revenue growth story just because of that. And that\u2019s really what I was talking about kind of why do we think there is double-digit revenue growth potential there for years to come. It\u2019s because of the still very, I\u2019d say, kind of early stage of where that stands.\nDavid Wichmann: Dr. Decker?\nWyatt Decker: Thank you. Thanks, Josh. So, I think Rex covered it nicely. So I would just underscore a couple of points. One is this is a major growth engine for Optum as we go forward, as we convert fee-for-service practices to value-based care models. Second is as we touched on earlier, this is very compelling for our physician colleagues. It\u2019s quite attractive. It actually allows us to decrease the administrative burden and allow our doctors to practice medicine, which is what they want to do. And the third is that we have a deep expertise in this space, because we have been practicing fully captive, fully delegated risk models for over 12 years and we are able to bring that expertise to our new practices throughout the country. Dave, you touched on the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast. Those are areas where you can expect to see significant growth in our risk-bearing capacities and care delivery. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. So this is a critical anchor strategy both for Optum as well as for UnitedHealth Group. It\u2019s a very important part of how we will continue to advance outsized growth for this enterprise going forward with an aim towards serving obviously more people and doing so with better experiences comes in lower cost. This was designed by the Optum team through their strategic process led by Andrew Witty and they have done a really nice job deploying this capability not only on behalf of Optum, but of course on behalf of all the UnitedHealth Group. Thank you for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just wanted to ask about M&A a little more, you have got obviously nice step up in growth expected this year. Any thoughts about what you are assuming relative to your ability to do normal risk assessments and get appropriately reimbursed for the patient population? Have you taken a more conservative view given the COVID backdrop or do you think you can get back to normal there? And just any quick comment on the 2022 rate notice, the final rate notice that they have just released and how you view that?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure. Tim Noel, Head of M&R?\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks, A.J., for the questions. So, first on 2022 revenue that you are getting at there with diagnosis capture for 2021, little bit early to talk about that at depth, but a couple of things I will offer is, one, we are really focused in M&R about getting our members vaccinated as soon as possible and across the enterprise, there is also a focus on doing the same for the frontline healthcare workers. And as both of these things happen, I think seniors will become increasingly more comfortable accessing care and that will have obviously an impact on diagnosis capture in 2021 that impacts revenue for 2022. We are being to be seen exactly how that timing plays out and we obviously have a bit of time remaining as we think about the 2022 bid to inform what does play out at the time of the bid and when that\u2019s submitted. With respect to the final notice that was published by CMS on January 15, as you know, number one, earlier than that\u2019s normally published. And the all-in rates that were included in that final notice of just north of 4% was a little bit of an increase over the advance notice. Beyond that, nothing really surprising with respect to rules or policy changes contained in the final notice this year. Really too early to comment on what that means for rates and benefits, lot of moving parts that remain as we think about the 2022 bid filing. Certainly, COVID is one of those things that we are watching as well with respect to that.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question. Just if I can add on a little bit, first, one of the key things for us and the reason why Tim started with vaccine is, because it\u2019s important for us to get our substantial health workforce vaccinated in part, our nurse house calls work for us so that they can safely pass into the home more broadly than maybe what we have seen including in more volatile circumstances. The other thing just to recognize is the extent that there was impacts on risk adjustment for 2021 we did take those into consideration in providing you with our estimates back in December. Thanks for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Alright, great. Thanks. Just wanted to maybe dig back into the $1.80 COVID headwind, is there anyway for you to kind of give us more dimensioning around kind of just how that at least from a relative size perspective flows across the three Optum businesses and the three health plan businesses? And it sounds like commercial is coming in better than you thought. Is there anything that maybe is different than what you thought a couple of months ago when you first provided that? Anything better, anything worse?\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Yes. Good morning, Kevin. John Rex. So, the broad view on that is about two-thirds of that relates to the UnitedHealthcare businesses when we think about just over $2 billion in impact, of negative impact from COVID-19 in 2021 and about a third relates to the Optum businesses. That\u2019s kind of the general view. As we breakdown to different businesses and think about impacts on those, some of the commentary it offers. So, within OptumInsight, it is most sensitive to just kind of broadly claims volumes and business activity, general business activity. Those are kind of the factors that have been a component within that. The risk-bearing businesses of OptumHealth are impacted similarly to the UnitedHealthcare businesses as you would expect also in terms of activity there. Within the different categories across OptumHealth, across UnitedHealthcare in general, I would just tell you kind of as we look at that, so Dave just cited that as it relates to how we anticipated and incorporated thoughts about facility for seniors to access care and get proper risk adjustment done. So, that\u2019s an impact that\u2019s mostly felt within Medicare & Retirement in terms of that component of it, as you would expect also and to some extent, to a lesser extent, in the Community & State where you would have some of the Dual Special Needs plans membership also. Within OptumRx, that is mostly also a volume-driven component. Has to do largely just with physician visit activity often in terms of scripts being written and as those flow through the system. So, those are kind of the broad overall impacts I would offer. And Dirk, any other comments?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. I think one of the things you mentioned was on commercial. I think what\u2019s resulted in sort of little stronger outlook than what we expected from a membership standpoint is persistency was better. There was a lot of groups that decided to stick. I would also say the various government stimulus packages helped. And I would also say one product stood out for us is our All Savers level-funded product, which has done extremely well which is kind of you give back, if the group performs better than expected they get a refund, if it\u2019s worse than they expected, then you ultimately get a \u2013 if better than expected, then they have \u2013 they get the refund if it\u2019s better than expected. So, that\u2019s a good thing. If it\u2019s worse, then the stop loss policy kicks in. But long story short, I think some good products, as we talked about plus I would say good persistency was a big benefit to commercial.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Kevin. That\u2019s all we have time for today. So, apologies to Ralph and Ricky both whose questions got cut off somehow. So, please, I am glad we were able to fix that, but please give our team a call and we will be happy to answer any other questions that you have. I would like to thank you all for joining us again today. I hope this morning\u2019s call provided you with useful context and importantly clarity and helped to better understand our ambitions for the year ahead. As I said in my opening remarks, we are starting 2021 with an optimistic view. Despite these extraordinary circumstances, our team continues to manage the challenges at hand with unprecedented resiliency and ingenuity. At the same time, we continue to pursue our long-term growth strategy with an even greater sense of urgency and intensity building upon the agility, insights and considerable new capabilities developed this past year to deliver a high-performing healthcare system built on personal human connections, enabled through information and technology and supported by strong alignment of physician-led value-based delivery of care serving millions of people one person at a time while delivering distinguished returns for our shareholders. Thanks again for joining us. We\u2019ll see you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 14, 2020, which maybe accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The past 9 months have hopefully provided you a window into both the values and capabilities of this organization and how they enable us to serve our customers, patients, care providers, team members and their families and you, our investors, in a period of unprecedented challenge. I am fortunate to witness up close the exceptional work of our team everyday, an innovative, growing and highly adaptable enterprise driven by the compassion, expertise and restless spirit of our 325,000 people, over 120,000 of them providing care on the frontlines. Our collective experiences over this year have made us an even more deeply committed and energized organization about our potential to help advance the next generation health system, one which is fair, affordable, simpler and effective. Our team combines division with sharp focus on day-to-day execution, delivering strong well-balanced results across the enterprise. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $3.51 per share with the decline from the year ago quarter reflecting the swift customer and consumer support actions we committed to from the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based upon this performance and forward estimate of pandemic impacts, we are updating our full year 2020 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $16.50 to $16.75 per share. In this, we remain committed to ensuring any financial imbalances arising from the pandemic are addressed proactively and fairly for those we serve. We have done this consistently over this period even as the ultimate outcomes remain unclear. As the timeliness of relief to our stakeholders is critical, service, fairness and performance with a long-term view, this is what you could continue to expect from us. You should also expect this enterprise will apply its innovative spirit to contribute in a new and different ways as our capabilities expand and circumstances require. We have partnered on and led clinical trials, helping resolve the nation\u2019s critical PPE and PCR supply chain issues and enabling more rapid testing at considerable scale, while keeping the health workforce safe. We are supporting state testing operations in California, New Jersey, North Carolina and Indiana and contact tracing in New York City. We are supporting the Mayo Clinic\u2019s development of convalescent plasma and some of the most promising vaccine and antibody trials. We have helped enabled workforce safety through the development of ProtectWell, a protocol processing technology to enable the safety of the health workforce as well as the safe opening of businesses, schools and nursing homes. We are working to assist with employees\u2019 health coverage transitions through our GetCovered campaign now being offered by employers to assist people who have lost their jobs. We provided $2 billion in liquidity relief for the health system and our customers and consumers will realize over $3 billion in premium and cost sharing relief, including $1 billion in estimated rebates. We have contributed more than $100 million of financial support and 6 million pounds of meals for communities suffering from food insecurity, homelessness, and health disparities. These efforts are possible, because we operate a capable set of businesses and capacities that are leading the development of the next generation health system and expanding our opportunities to serve. Today, I would like to give you a brief sense of this work. Early in the pandemic, we quickly enabled Optum physicians and the physicians of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s most vulnerable patients to adapt and expand rapidly to meet the needs of millions of patients for care of chronic and emerging conditions. This included advancing telehealth by creating direct connections between patients and their own physicians, a critical element to highly effective digital health, ensuring adoption will extend well beyond this crisis. So far this year, OptumCare physicians have facilitated 1 million digital clinical visits directly with their patients. And we are rapidly developing a proprietary set of distinctive tools and aligning our clinical practices to further develop and amplify this capability. I am sure you can see how advancing modern telehealth fits into our overall strategy to build high performing systems of care. Our growing therapeutics capacities are positively impacting the management of chronic diseases. With the introduction of Level 2, a digital therapy developed to improve the lives of the 30 million people with Type 2 diabetes, we are helping patients move toward remission of the disease. Level 2 uniquely measures signals and applies artificial intelligence engaging people in producing better health outcomes. You can expect more digital therapeutics from us in the coming months and years. Our growing capacities are especially apparent within our OptumCare platform, where 53,000 physicians across 1,500 local patient-centered facilities serve nearly 20 million patients, over 3.5 million of these in some form of risk arrangements, with 1.3 million Medicare Advantage or dually-eligible members under global capitation. OptumCare creates substantial value by building a deeper clinician patient relationship and by leveraging data and artificial intelligence to enable our clinical model to intercept and treat disease early and proactively leading to better health outcomes, value and industry leading patient experiences. Our patients are experienced safer, healthier, more fulfilling lifestyles, spending one-third fewer days per year on average in a hospital bed and 40% fewer days in a skilled nursing facility than patients supported by traditional Medicare fee-for-service. Moreover, our most advanced care delivery practices deliver this high-quality care at upwards of 40% lower costs than the equivalent traditional Medicare benefit, with the value fully reflected in improved benefits and lower costs for seniors all at world class NPS scores in the mid-70s. The proven clinical success of Optum Senior Care offerings supports our considerable growth goals for OptumCare and also demonstrates the longer term potential to greatly benefit consumers and commercial offerings. We have been building this platform for over a decade now and expect it to continue to grow at strong double-digit rates for years to come. Another aspect of a modern next generation health system is managing the specialized and costly medications of the future in a way which works for patients, clinicians, employers and payers. Our OptumRx integrated specialty solution brings a total approach to managing complex conditions across both the medical and pharmacy benefits, where we are able to generate up to 37,000 in annual savings per patient by employing clinically appropriate care at more convenient lower cost sites. This approach is enabled by Optum\u2019s growing footprint of integrated community pharmacies which will grow by over 60 centers in 2020 and the number of patients served with our infusion services will grow at double-digit rates. We expect this to be another durable growth trend given the much safer and clinically equivalent patient experience. We see OptumRx as continuing to transform to be a leader in pharmacy care services. Put differently, we believe the value for people and the system from pharmacy care services resides in managing personal engagement in health, not just supply chain management. This plays to our strengths and will increasingly contribute to the growth of OptumRx in the years ahead. UnitedHealthcare continues to focus on the very needs of healthcare consumers. In the next generation health system, we expect consumer benefits to become increasingly customized to meet these needs as people search for solutions which are simple, affordable and help enable quality outcomes. UnitedHealthcare see strong reception to our expanding suite of highly tailored and affordable individual coverages. This year alone, the number of people we serve with individual health coverage has grown by 15%. Likewise, an employer sponsored coverage, our growing set of consumer centered, innovative and flexible offerings such as bind, all savers and traditional line plans such as Harmony in Southern California are gaining traction, with membership in these offerings having grown over 50% this year. You know many of you are interested in the Annual Medicare Advantage enrollment period which opens tomorrow. The 2021 benefit year will be UnitedHealthcare\u2019s largest Medicare Advantage footprint expansion in 5 years, reaching an additional 3.2 million people in nearly 300 additional counties. We are emphasizing what we know seniors are looking for this year even more than ever, stability and value. Premiums for most people we serve will be flat or reduced and nearly 2.5 million people will have no premium at all. We continue to innovate our product offerings, with all Medicare Advantage plans featuring zero co-pay primary care digital health visits and the expansion of our personal support services, such as an annual clinical health assessment delivered in a senior\u2019s home and for many the assignment of a dedicated UnitedHealthcare navigator. We expect strong growth in individual MA and when combined with our group Medicare gains, 2021 is shaping up to be another year of market leading growth. We also expect continued growth in Medicaid due to transitions in coverage and net new market gains and are looking forward to a record RFP season as we seek to serve more people in more geographies. What I have described for you this morning is a sampling of the initiatives we are pursuing today to help lead in the development of the next generation health system, a health system that works better for everyone, those who experienced care, those who provide care and those who pay for care. Now, I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dave. Broadly speaking, third quarter results continued to be impacted by disrupted care patterns, albeit to a much lesser extent than in the second quarter, as many regions of the country stabilize near to more normalized levels. Within the quarter, care deferral impacts were more than offset by the proactive consumer and customer assistance measures we voluntarily undertook earlier this year as well as COVID-19 care and testing costs and broader economic effects. These factors resulted in a 10% year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings per share. As we discussed last quarter, the deepest period of care deferral, which occurred in the second quarter and the timing of that recognition of our assistance actions built entirely lining up, which makes for a more pronounced adverse impact to earnings in the second half of 2020. The measures we voluntarily undertook mostly impact our benefits businesses and contribute to the UnitedHealthcare\u2019s third quarter operating earnings decline from a year ago. In the quarter, we saw total care activity now exceeding 95% of seasonal baseline, with certain categories even more closely approaching normal. This compares to an overall measure of about two-thirds at the lowest point in the second quarter. Each of the three Optum businesses continue to perform well, while accepted in different ways by still recovering care patterns and economic effects. Optum helped third quarter earnings increase 12% year-over-year as fee-for-service practices and ambulatory surgery activity began to recover, while risk bearing practices still experienced some modest continual effects from deferral of care. Our SCA ambulatory surgery centers operated about 95% of seasonal baseline in the third quarter compared to 55% in the second quarter. Year-to-date, over 1,000 new surgeons, have performed procedures at FDA as they seek a safe, convenient and efficient clinical partner. New surgeon affiliations for the 9-month period rose nearly 25% over last year and we continue to expand the complexity of procedures performed in these settings, having added over 40 new service lines nearly doubled last year. Patients increasingly prefer these three family centers with NPS measured at 92. These durable long-term trends will benefit our growth even more strongly in the future as elective care activity fully normalized. OptumInsight third quarter earnings increased 24% year-over-year, while the revenue backlog grew by $0.5 billion in the quarter to nearly $20 billion. Payor services and state government businesses performed strongly, while we continue to see lower activity in the provider-facing businesses due to procedural volumes. While still not fully normalized, business development activity has increased from the second quarter\u2019s much lower pacing. OptumRx earnings declined 2% year-over-year in the third quarter as script volumes were impacted by lower care activity and economic factors. Personal scripts, which are correlated to a physician business activity, greatly improved from the second quarter, which was down about 25%, while not yet fully back to prior year levels. Revenues in our expanding pharmacy services businesses have grown nearly 30% year-to-date. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, third quarter operating results reflect a considerable moderation of the care deferral impact experienced in the second quarter, while it\u2019s still not at baseline levels. This was more than offset by our assistance measures, direct COVID-19 care costs and economic factors. The number of people served in commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions. Within this, for us, about 40% of the fee-based decline came from very large employers, primarily in the hospitality, transportation and energy sectors. During the third quarter, growth in Medicaid membership accelerated, benefiting from the continued easing of state re-determination requirements. We have not yet seen material Medicaid enrollment activity due to job losses and historically, these transitions lag loss with healthcare coverage by about 6 months. Our Medicaid business has seen strong year-to-date organic growth of over 500,000 people. Sales activity in Medicare Advantage has continued to move towards more normalized patterns after seeing some slowing in the second quarter due to the pandemic. Within this, we have seen considerably less plan switching than typical for existing Medicare Advantage enrollees, while selection of MA over fee-for-service for people new to Medicare is tracking well. We continue to deepen our engagement with those seniors most in need, increasing the distribution of remote digital sensor kits to collect and monitor vital health data and address gaps in care generated by the pandemic. Seniors continue to highly value our house call programs with the number of home visits in the third quarter growing by nearly 30% over last year. Our liquidity and financial position remains strong. Third quarter cash flow is up $3.1 billion or 1x net income reflects the extra federal tax payment in the quarter due to the deferral of payments typically paid in the second quarter. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations are $16.1 billion or 1.2x net earnings and our debt to total capital ratio of 39.1% compares to 43.7% in the year ago quarter. As noted earlier, we have updated our full year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $16.50 to $16.75 per share. This reflects third quarter performance, while anticipating the fourth quarter will reflect continued customer assistance measures, normalization in care patterns and rising acuity as a result of missed and deferred treatments. We will continue to work proactively to help people obtain the care they need. Now, I will turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. With the third quarter earnings report, we have at times provided some early soundings on our growth outlook. Even as the current environment is anything, but routine, I will still try to offer some useful perspectives. We approach the future with continued conviction on our long-term 13% to 16% earnings growth objective. Some of the factors giving us confidence include our rapidly expanding care delivery services now benefiting from over a decade of building and investing in local value-based care systems and extension into market leading post-acute home and modern behavioral health intervention services. Our ability to support seniors across multiple channels and markets was increasingly innovative high-value offerings. The way we meet the growing needs of people with highly complex conditions with comprehensive personalized care, including people across commercial, federal and state-based programs. The innovative and consumer response of products is now being offered through the employer and individual market channels. Our unmatched ability to support a more interoperable and intelligent health system as a result of significant investments over many years to improve performance, integrating data analytics and clinical information to provide essential insights to evidence-based next best care actions and our restless drive to allocate capital in line with other innovative companies as we lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. These are just a few of the accelerating capabilities which will enable our enterprise to serve more people much more deeply as we look to the years ahead. As to early thoughts on 2021, we expect our underlying business performance to be strong and well supportive of our long-term growth objectives, including the tailwinds we have highlighted throughout this morning. The pandemic and related economic impacts of course remain difficult to predict and at this distance likely represents a significant potential headwind. As a result, we envision stepping out initially with a more conservative all-in 2021 starting point to accommodate these still developing and unknown COVID-related impacts in particular the pacing of a return to more normal levels of care services and the condition of the economy. As the environment continues to evolve, we will also continue to evolve our thinking in perspective and it is our custom, we look forward to providing you further perspectives on all aspects of our business at our investor conference on Tuesday, December 1 which will be held virtually this year. Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just to pursue a little bit further the comments that Dave just made about thinking about next year, I guess predicting a medical cost trend you have got a lot of moving parts there, potential further deferrals, potential pent-up demand that could come back, cost of vaccines and therapies that could be there, a number of things and thinking about the cost trend for next year, how are you approaching that? How do you see a competitive environment that is changing as a result of that, just maybe flush that old comment about how uncertain the ability to predict the medical cost trend is for next year?\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, A.J., a very thoughtful question. Hopefully, you took away from the prepared remarks that we are optimistic about the performance of our business and that\u2019s pretty much universal across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We didn\u2019t get into some of the smaller size businesses, but we are optimistic in particular about our relative competitive position and the growth prospects for 2021. But as also indicated, we remain deeply respectful of the environment both the pandemic and related economic consequences. And one thing I would underscore, AJ, is what you had very well, there are a number of moving parts, which are very difficult to predict and you should also know that we are extending our efforts to ensure that our chronic members and patients are getting the care that they need during this unprecedented time and we also still have a strong commitment towards correcting any imbalances that could occur. So, at this instance, we do see our business \u2013 underlying business performing strongly and aligned to our long-term growth objectives, which are 13% to 16% per year offset in part by these pandemic-related effects. So the starting point, as we indicated in December, will likely represent a wider range given the possible outcomes and a more conservative all-in expectation than normal that you would normally see from us given all the elements that you just described. So, we are taking that into consideration as we develop our point of view about where our MLR might land, how \u2013 what the variability of that might be. We see it generally speaking that whole pandemic related impacts is being an area \u2013 a headwind for the organization, but don\u2019t misread it, we are very bullish on the strong underlying growth performance of our business. Thank you. Next question, please.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, fine.\nOperator: And next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a question on OptumCare, I guess and you are seeing big growth in the PMPMs there on the consumers served and I just want to better understand the relative performance sort of 3Q year-over-year versus 2Q kind of what\u2019s driving that increase in revenue per member? And then if you could also talk about sort of physician recruiting and how that\u2019s going over the last 6 months?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure, Josh. Great questions and I think you are hitting on one of the strengths of the enterprise and one of the reasons why we are showing growth for next year. Simply said it would be more market, more deeply penetrated into those markets and a higher percentage of them having a risk-bearing arrangement. But Wyatt, do you want to talk more fully?\nWyatt Decker: Yes, sure. Thanks, Josh and thank you, Dave. I think, Dave, you captured it well. What we are seeing is as we grow, we not only have increased the number of members we serve to 98 million, but we have increased by 25% the revenue per member and that\u2019s being driven in part by the more extensive services that we would offer somebody through a risk-based arrangement in OptumCare versus the lighter touch that you might see through some of the other businesses within OptumHealth. We expect that trend to continue and frankly are very excited about double-digit growth in our MA risk life and related fully [capitated][ph] lives that we serve. Another piece I would say, Josh, around your question about physician recruitment is we have seen continued robust interest in both small tuck-in acquisitions as well as medium and large physician groups who are attracted to both stability, the physician leadership and the evidence based approach that we have embraced in OptumCare. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Good question, Josh. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: We are going next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to circle back to the comments on 2021. First, from a consensus, in and around your 11% range for growth year-over-year [indiscernible] wondering if you think this will fall within that range at any point [indiscernible] to be in the breadth of the business?\nDavid Wichmann: Justin, we are having a hard time hearing you. If you are on a headset, can you pick up the handset?\nJustin Lake: Sure. Is this better?\nDavid Wichmann: No.\nJustin Lake: No, okay, hold on.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay.\nJustin Lake: Is that better?\nDavid Wichmann: It is. Thank you.\nJustin Lake: Sorry about that. So, what I wanted to do was circle back to the comments you made on 2021, first consensus earnings growth, I think I am curious to look like it\u2019s targeting around 11% year-over-year, still below your 13 to 16, wondering if you think that might your wider than typical guidance still might include that consensus estimate within the range? And then can you point us to the specific businesses where you are seeing, the potential impact of, call it in a recession concerns, maybe beyond just a typical commercial membership? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Fair enough. John?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Justin. It\u2019s John Rex here. As Dave pointed out, I think we are quite confident in terms of the underlying growth of the organization as we look towards 2021 and kind of in a normal year, I would think kind of things like even [indiscernible] that consensus range that\u2019s the point would be kind of in a normal zone that one could expect an area that we would think about stepping out with. We are very respectful of the fact however as anything, but a normal year end. We have learned so much every month like I\u2019d tell you during this period over the last 6 months and in terms of how we operate, how our businesses perform, how we need to respond for the people we serve. And so we have continued to be in a respectful mode in terms of learning more, understanding the situation better and realizing there could be significant impacts in certain businesses as we think about \u2013 as we think about performance. So, we look at it in the world of excluding kind of this world we operate in today with kind of COVID-related impacts, a good zone where it fits, but you should expect that we think that there are potential headwinds within there, whether those are economic headwinds, whether those are factors in terms of what we need to do from a customer assistance perspective and really kind of really the pacing of direct COVID care and treatment costs. So, perhaps a longwinded way of getting asked we are in a mode still of really trying to be responsive to what we are seeing in the environment and evolve our thinking as that environment evolves. And Justin, I don\u2019t think I heard - picked up your second question, if you could repeat that one, it was just hard to hear?\nJustin Lake: Yes, what I was asking is specifically around the segments that could be impacted and most of all, I know COVID is a potential uncertainty, [indiscernible] in the market as a lot of companies are trying to price for that adding a little bit to trend. Is that something that you felt like you did for last year and you are just still being conservative, but you feel like that\u2019s something that\u2019s tough to do in this environment? Thanks.\nDirk McMahon: No, I mean, Justin, this is Dirk McMahon. How are you doing? What I would say is, we are of course going to price to our best estimates of forward trends that\u2019s going to include COVID, but you asked about the economic impact. So as we sat back and we looked at the third quarter, actually, our membership was a little less impacted than we thought it was going to be, because of things like the payroll protection program as well as some furloughs that large employers did. So yes, there will be a little bit of a running problem, but less than what we expected. So, from a membership standpoint, we are actually fairly optimistic about how we priced. We continue to look at how our block is priced for 1-1 and as we look at that, we are more than competitive and we monitor that everyday.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Justin. Great questions. Next question, please.\nOperator: We are next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning. John, you mentioned expectation for a decline in plan switching this year in the MA market, just curious did you make any color on why you expect that to be the case? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Just to follow-up, I think, what we \u2013 one of the things I commented on was actually we are seeing less plan switching to normal actually. And what we are seeing is strong adoption of people new to Medicare coming into Medicare Advantage.\nDavid Wichmann: Tim, anything to know?\nTim Noel: Yes, Frank. Thanks. Tim Noel. Good morning. Yes, what John alluded to is that what we have seen in the marketplace is a decline in people that are switching from one MA carrier to the next. However, a lot of strength in what we call the chooser market, which are folks that are newly eligible for Medicare or people that are choosing a Medicare Advantage plan compared to other coverage types throughout the course of the year. So, we have seen really good, strong demand in those categories, but the plan switching activity was lighter and in particular, in March and April, it\u2019s come back a little bit throughout the course of the year and actually, we have seen some better activity recently. So, the dynamic in the marketplace as we head into any enrollment period is one where we are trending back to an environment that\u2019s more normal compared to selling season in the past.\nFrank Morgan: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Frank. Next question, please.\nOperator: We are next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. Question on the Medicaid side of the enrollment impact from higher unemployment is coming in lower than you expect. When do you expect the impact to peak? How do you think about the balance of going to Medicaid versus exchanges? And then on the Medicaid side, has the pandemic change how states think about transitioning to higher acuity populations to managed care fee-for-service and what type of visibility do you have for Medicaid rates for next year at this point of time?\nDavid Wichmann: Pretty much covered the entire landscape, Ricky, well done. We will try to be as responsive as possible on all of that. Tim Spilker is our Chief Executive for Community & State.\nTim Spilker: Yes. Hey, thanks for the question. And you are definitely hitting on a lot of the factors that we have been tracking. The first step just in terms of enrollment and Dirk mentioned this as is John in his opening comments so far what we have seen just in terms of enrollment gains is really the result of the suspension re-determination through the result of the CARES Act. We really have not yet seen unemployment pull through. And I think that\u2019s reflective of some of the dynamics that we are seeing in the commercial market. And that\u2019s been supported I think by a lot of external studies as well. So, we continue to watch this, I think we would expect that unemployment would pull through at some point, especially as the timeframe between lots of coverage increases. As for your second question, just around complex populations, yes, we are actively monitoring states as they explore transitions to managed care. We believe there is a very strong value proposition, especially for complex populations, including those that receive long-term care services and HCBS services. We know based on our experience that managed care can deliver significant value, not just in terms of cost savings, but also in terms of helping individuals remain in their homes, helping people access social services and support. And so we have been working with states and monitoring states activity as they transition. I think we are seeing a very robust RFP pipeline, as Dave mentioned and we are hopeful that many states include long-term care services in complex populations in those. And then finally, I think your last question was on funding and rates, and so just on that one, yes, this is something that we have also been working closely with our state customers on really to ensure that funding is sustainable both now and into 2021, especially considering all of the dynamics in play. States are really taking a rational approach to funding. They are leveraging the appropriate risk management mechanisms, depending on their experience that include risk corridors and MLR structures. They are also benefiting from some of the additional federal funding through the CARES Act. And then of course, just is a reminder, Medicaid funding must be actuarially sound, which our states really do continue to use as a guiding principle. This is certainly an area of focus for us. We have strong relationships with our customers and we feel good about those conversations thus far. And then maybe just the last thing I would say is sustainable funding. And all of this work is really critical as it enables us to invest in programs that really do drive substantial social and health outcomes for our customers as well as for the people that we serve.\nDavid Wichmann: So, Ricky, I hope that was responsive, at least responsive enough. Thank you for the thorough question. Next question, please.\nOperator: And the next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hey, good morning. Two part question just in case I strike out on the first one. I was wondering if you could quantify the consumer and customer assistance how that impacted the MLR this quarter? The second part of the question is just thinking about cost trend heading into 2021. I think by the time this year is all said and done, you might end up being on your on your core commercial group, cost trend down a couple of 100 basis points at least. So, when you are thinking about your guidance for \u201821, are you thinking it could be a normal cost trend on top of that? Are you thinking deferrals would accelerate it could be 200 basis points or more higher than normal, just interested in your thought process on how you are going to comp what was easier than expected all-in trend for 2020?\nDavid Wichmann: Well, I will give you the strike on the first one, because I don\u2019t think we are going to quantify customer and consumer assistance in the quarter. The one thing I would tell you is it\u2019s extensive in particular. This is one of the primary quarters where the Medicare business was offering full co-pay waivers on both primary care and specialist visits. And the reason for that, Gary, is that we were deeply concerned and remain deeply concerned that Medicare consumers access their physicians just as quickly as possible, because they are obviously managing chronic disease and we saw a very nice response to that program so much so that we are extending elements of it into the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s where our customer assistance will continue. In addition to that, we extended some other programs you probably saw that our $1.5 billion of initial estimate went to $2 billion and in part that was because of additional premium waivers and adjustments that we have made that will extend through the balance of this year and modestly into next as well. So that gives you a color for the kind of the volume, the quantity of things that were going on during that timeframe. And with respect to cost trends in 2021, Dirk you want to take?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, I would say, Gary, this goes back to what Dave said originally, we do consider all of those factors you described. We consider what we expect COVID to do with respect to testing, with respect to treatment, all things that are associated with abatement as well we make an estimate of that. We are tying to make a forecast of when the vaccines would come available. So, all those things are considered as we price our business for next year. I am not going to get into the exact number of basis points associated with each one of those that\u2019s competitive. But I mentioned earlier, we do monitor what\u2019s going on in the market, what we see with ongoing trends in all three of those buckets as well as all of the underlying cost. And we make our best estimate as to where we should land to be competitive for a membership growth standpoint as well as earnings standpoint. That\u2019s what we do and we have actuaries and we have management teams that are pretty experienced with that.\nDavid Wichmann: So, thank you for the question. Gary, next question please.\nOperator: We are going next to Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on Medicare Advantage for 2021 and the comments that David made around industry leading growth expectations and guess really just a two-part question to this just one, so we do have CMS projecting the at least 10% enrollment growth for individual MA for 2021. So, just interested in terms of your commentary in industry leading growth how you take that into context and whether that would support double-digit enrollment growth in individual MA for 2021? And then just secondly, it sounded like the comments around group MA, it sounded pretty bullish in terms of sales, just interested if you can maybe quantify for us the expected \u2013 the group MA lives that so far you think you have added for 2021? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Just to clarify, Scott, from at least my standpoint, what I really look at is the number of people served and what our performance will be relative to the market overall. And as has being pretty consistent over time, UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement has outperformed on that metric in particular. What I like about this year in particular is what, not only the group MA component really coming off of what would be a disappointing year in 2020 meaning the 2021 actual policy year, but also the kind of setup for individual MA and continuation with our newly eligible members in their growth. So, that\u2019s the essence of the backdrop of the comment that I made. Tim, do you want add anything further?\nTim Noel: Yes, thanks, Scott. So, selling obviously starts tomorrow for individual Medicare Advantage. We have been marketing our products since the beginning of October, receiving really positive feedback from the broker community about how we are positioned. And once again, as you know, our top priority is providing stability and benefit for the members that we serve. And as they go to market, we are happy to have succeeded in providing that for our members and in fact about 75% of our members will experience improving benefits in 2021 compared to 2020. And then we also made some additional investments and capabilities to support seniors. So given that backdrop, we do feel really good about our positioning to gain share in individual MA, group MA as well as the dual special needs plans to market. We are not going to comment specifically on any point estimate for industry growth, but we really like our positioning from inside of the growth whatever that might be. And today\u2019s comments, we are really excited about our group MA growth for 2021.\nDavid Wichmann: Great, thank you, Scott. Next question, please.\nOperator: And next, we have Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Great, thanks for the question. I guess maybe just wanted to get your latest thinking on participating in direct contracting next year, obviously, through OptumCare. I was wondering if this would contribute at all to your projections around global cap wise growth or would that be incremental? And then maybe just relatedly, how are you thinking about direct contracting relative to the opportunity obviously around MA on the UHC side? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Let\u2019s start with UHC.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Brian Thompson here. As it relates to Medicare Advantage, as you have known from us for a long time, we have had the enterprise perspective of modernizing fee-for-service, but we are certainly encouraged by any activities like this. We participate in things like bundled payment programs, etcetera. And I see direct contracting as a positive to try to modernize the overall fee-for-service system in total and why it obviously is looking at direct contracting to going to OptumCare.\nJohn Rex: Yes, thanks, BT and Robert, thanks for the question. We are very encouraged by every effort to move from fee-for-service to value based contracting. So use this as a positive trend. The direct contracting proposals are primarily geared towards smaller groups that are in fee-for-service. And we have been in risk based arrangements for over 10 years. And so while we will embrace this, where it\u2019s appropriate, we have relationships with over 80 payers, and we will expect to see continued double digit growth of our MA and dual risk lives that we care for. And I don\u2019t anticipate that the direct contracting would be a major factor for us. But again, I don\u2019t mean to say that in any kind of a negative way, it\u2019s a good program, but it\u2019s \u2013 we will embrace all vehicles to grow. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks for the question, Robert. Next question, please.\nOperator: We are going next to Sarah James with Piper. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSarah James: Thank you. I was hoping if you could give us some context around corporate tax reform looking back to 2018, you sized the benefit around $2 billion wondering where that sits now and if there is a difference between product lines and how we should think about which line benefited on a margin side versus was passed through for pricing changes or other items?\nJohn Rex: Sarah, good morning. This is John Rex here. So I think if we go back to the former period that you are discussing in corporate tax reform I think there are a number of things that we commented on during that period. And in terms of impacts and if you recall, during that period, we also commented about investments that we are making, as a result, to build to build for future growth and how we were how we were investing in the businesses for longer term. So that was an element there clearly, since that period, a number of years ago now the company is much, much larger. So you would expect the kind of that impact is much smaller from an effective tax rate impact than we would have had back in that in that time. among the other elements that you were talking to incorporate tax reform and impacts, I think it is tough, really to kind of get out ahead of anything in terms of potential impacts, and even how those impact down on specific businesses just because there has not been, we just don\u2019t really don\u2019t want to get ahead in any kind of policy that might be that might be out there. So probably would just leave it at that. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Sarah. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next is David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And I am interested in I appreciate the comments, several kind of percentage of baseline utilization numbers offered in the prepared remarks. I am curious how that has progressed perhaps through the quarter, for example, by the end of the quarter, were some of those at or above 100%? Are you expecting that to get to above baseline in the fourth quarter and based on your assessments of kind of pent up under utilization and system capacity? How long might you expect that to last and then just a tag on the DCP for the first couple of quarters of the year had been pretty consistent year over year, but at the third quarter is down, a couple days two to three days. I am wondering how that folds into that view of where utilization is going. Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Alright, David, John Rex, let me answer that I get those. So first of all, let me give you a little more color in terms of what we saw in utilization over the course of the quarter and how it fits to what we are seeing last quarter and so I spoke to kind of baseline exceeding 95% across our businesses as we look at the utilization at this point here, maybe a little color kind of context within that and different categories and how those would trend. I point out if I look at physician services that would be below that baseline, might post kind of outpatient surgery, that kind of the writer kind of in that zone, that baseline and I put in patient above that baseline zone, as we look down to kind of various populations and such maybe a little color commentary in terms of how that trends. So commercial, certainly kind of higher in terms of where we are seeing utilization and where we are seeing against baseline, and government programs services lower. And within that, I would say kind of within the government programs, let\u2019s say, the community state business being the lower element of both and that the way it\u2019s trending. One important element here you saw what you referred to from the commentary we had for our expectations for the fourth quarter and then so among those were that care that has been deferred that we are able to help facilitate that carrying curves and that\u2019s kind of where we are making investments and what we want to see happen here. The other element that we anticipate as we look towards the end of the year is we have been anticipating the rising acuity because of deferred and mistreatment, then we\u2019d see higher acuity population. I tell you we really haven\u2019t seen that yet. Where we see rising acuity on the overall book is it\u2019s because of the COVID-19 cases that come in at a higher acuity level. And so you see a higher acuity on that component. But if you take that component out, we don\u2019t really see it across the full scope of the book of our business at this point. As your \u2013 to your comment over in terms \u2013 over the course of the quarter what we saw, essentially it was an interesting course in that perspective, because you saw different incidence rates in different parts of the country over the course of the quarter. So, we really monitored that quite closely and you would see as a particular part of the country, you saw infection rates begin to rise, you would see deferral come into that mix. Given our platform across the entire country, we have a viewpoint into that, but you see deferral and then you see it come back in. I think the last thing \u2013 place I would just point out is within kind of that baseline that we are talking about and so I said exceeding 95%, I put kind of in the zone of 5 points or so or probably COVID-19 driven in terms of within that mix and that\u2019s inclusive in the baseline we are talking about.\nDavid Windley: And then DCP?\nJohn Rex: And DCP, thank you for reminding, so DCP is declining year-over-year, so that is due to the really could be acceleration in provider payments that we took on earlier in the year. So, as we really were trying to get liquidity injected into the healthcare system, we accelerated our payment cycles very, very significantly and that continues. The reason you wouldn\u2019t have seen that in the second quarter is because of the very significant deferral of medical care in the second quarter. So, that\u2019s kind of getting into the math of it, right. We get a denominator here, where medical cost per day was declining very, very significantly in the second quarter, so that more than offset the impact of those payments. As we saw care being restored much closer to normal levels this quarter, then that comes up and so now you are seeing the impact of that accelerated payment cycle show up in our DCP, but that was impacting.\nDavid Windley: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: And just to remind you, to give you a sense of that, as we indicated in the prepared remarks as well as around the $2 billion advance to the market or acceleration in payment. Thank you, David. Next question, please.\nOperator: And next is Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, hey, thanks for getting the question. Maybe if I could follow-up on that about utilization and then tie it back to sort of your comments around the outlook for \u201821. If it sounds like in-patient volume is a little bit above normal, others of areas are a little bit below and overall, let\u2019s say we are kind of getting back to a normal baseline utilization, given that kind of pace that we are on this year and then we think about next year, what is it in your thinking that makes you think that we are going see a really big uptick in utilization, because it sounds like when we go back to the earlier part of the Q&A when you are \u2013 in your comments, Dave and John at the end was next year you are thinking about a more conservative starting point to think about the \u201821 outlook and I understand that we would want to backup some of the one-time items that were positive for this year. But maybe help us understand a little bit what is your underlying assumptions for utilization, because it seems to me, the pace that we are going at, it doesn\u2019t strike me that we are going to really have really over utilization per se next year, maybe help us understand what maybe you are seeing here as we are now into part of the fourth quarter that kind of gives you that sense?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. So, my comments are really grounded in the unprecedented uncertainty as we look forward and the deep respect for the pandemic and its impact on the economic climate. And that\u2019s why as you think about being at this distance stepping out recognizing that as you are \u2013 as the kind of the future expectation, you would normally widen your range and you would probably take a more conservative posture. And that\u2019s essentially what we were trying to communicate. And John, do you have anything further to add?\nJohn Rex: No. Like, sort of the one thing in your comment and I think you said kind of we have seen in-patient kind of above normal, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s where we are. I said on that exceeding 95% baseline, I was orienting those categories around how they orient around that exceeding 95%, but in-patient rides a little above that position below that and outpatient surgery is kind of right in that zone. So, that\u2019s more the commentary that I was providing there not that in-patient is running above baseline yet. But we certainly categories are progressing to that. And I think it goes in terms of your broader commentary into what to expect for utilization. So, we want to make sure people get the care they need. That\u2019s why we are here ultimately. And so we are going to do everything in our power to make sure that that care occurs. But you heard some of the commentary he offered earlier in the year even in terms of what was going on different categories in terms of cancer diagnoses, different areas that were off significantly, obviously that\u2019s not kind of good for people, that\u2019s not good for the system, we want to make sure that we are that, that care is getting delivered. And there are areas of care that we are going to be very proactive in making sure that people are able to access that. In our business, we have both direct access in the OptumCare businesses. UnitedHealthcare is being very proactive in its outreach to vulnerable populations and making sure that they are getting the treatment that they need. So, our ambition is to make sure that that care is delivered as there is much \u2013 there is a lot of necessary care that\u2019s not happening also. But, I would come back today\u2019s commentary, as we look out to 2021 and some of the earlier things of we have been learning stuff all along the way over the past many months and we continue to evolve that thinking and continue to feel like we get better perspectives, and why deeply respectful in terms of, we don\u2019t really know how this moves over the next several months also. So, I think that\u2019s what you hear in terms of our commentary in terms of how we think, why we think, how we think about stepping out and why that we want to be respectful of environment frankly that no one has navigated before. And I think that\u2019s just what you would expect us to the way you would expect us to approach it. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: And we will take the next 30, 45 days or so to accumulate more facts, understand even better and then lay all this out for you in more detail to the best of our ability. I want to get together on December 1. We have time for one more question with quick question and answer. And then I will close. Next question.\nOperator: And we will take the question from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, just wanted to ask them for employer enrollment, how is that progressing in October and what\u2019s your outlook for 4Q and beyond? And if you can give any clarification in OptumRx on kind of the real sharp increase in revenue per script and some other compression in margin, that would be helpful, too? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Hey, Lance. I don\u2019t think we will be able to give you insights into October in the quarter specifically, but what we can give you insights into is what\u2019s the progresses we are making across the board in the commercial market going forward. I will give you some sense of that without quantifying it. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. I would say that, as you think about the fourth quarter, the sense should be is there is a good amount of stickiness with respect to the end of this year in terms of persistency that we are seeing with our groups. And further, I think as we look at next year, I think we talked about in the script, we will have lot of good products coming off the assembly line that we are very enthused about. All savers are level funded product, find a good product, which basically is a scenario where you have a kind of a base level of courage and you buy out for cares meeting in certain categories, then we have, what I would say a bunch of provider-centric products where we are looking at really efficient, high-quality networks and having low consumer out of pockets associated with those. So, what I would say is we are optimistic about our product portfolio for next year as you look at the third quarter \u2013 the fourth quarter specifically. We have had good stickiness in terms of our persistency.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, I think the commercial business is doing a nice job. Obviously, we are very dissatisfied with the start of this year, but I think they have come on stronger as the years progressed with a wider array of product choices and offerings, but also getting their cost structures in line and being able to reflect that in more competitive price positions in the market overall, again appropriately index the forward view of cost plus margin, which reflects the variability of the future marketplace. John, do you want to touch on?\nJohn Prince: Sure, Lance, John Prince. Talking about the revenue growth, we have had really strong growth in our specialty business as well as infusion, our community pharmacies which is a general one. That has been a big driver as well as our external client wins we had on the beginning of the year if you look at our services businesses such as those services as I mentioned we are going on the 30% inside that so really strong growth in that in terms of our margin and why its declined, year over year, it is really two factors, one, on earnings side of the impact of COVID-19. As we know with the pandemic, we have had less [indiscernible] in Q2 that continued in Q3, as well, as we have seen in Q3, less utilization per member as well as some loss and unemployment. So that is the impact of our earnings. And on the denominator side, the retail co payment, which was added to revenue in 2020, was added to the denominator which actually impacted the margin in Q3. Overall, we are quite pleased with our margin performance, as you see, between Q2 and Q3 earnings grew sequentially, by 16%, as well as in commitment to group of margins. So overall, we are seeing we are exiting very well. \nDavid Wichmann: Perfect. Thank you, John. Thank you, Lance. And thanks to all of you for your interest in the very thoughtful, insightful questions that you offered today. As this is an unprecedented time in our company\u2019s history. As you have come to expect, we will continue to respond and lead with full strength compassion and fortitude, restlessness for serving the unique needs of every one of the 140 million people we serve around the world. Despite the challenging times the 325,000 people in the UnitedHealth Group are deeply committed and are energized about our work to advance the next generation health system in a socially conscious way it is a health system that will be universal, affordable, simple and effective. And we look forward to engaging you in several weeks at our upcoming annual investor conference on Tuesday, December 1 we see the virtual format as an opportunity to provide you an even deeper view of our company with strategic plans, its people and our future. Thank you very much. \nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation.

I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. When we last met in this forum 90 days ago, the challenges of COVID-19 in the Americas were just beginning to emerge. Now some four months into the evolving pandemic, the individual health system, social and economic implications of the virus are better understood and significant, especially the impact of longstanding health disparities affecting the underserved populations hit hardest by the pandemic.  In uncharted periods such as these, we lean on our mission and culture of values to guide us. That mission and those values call on us to help people, to help health systems, to help everyone with integrity, compassion, innovation, relationships, and performance. I am grateful to and proud of our 325,000 diverse team members as they continue to provide vital support, caring for those we serve and working with the health system partners to combat this disease and the many other daily health challenges that have not gone away, they\u2019ve just been deferred and possibly become more complicated. We deeply appreciate the tireless service of our 120,000 doctors, nurses, medical and behavioral professionals, social workers, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers on the front lines of care. They serve in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Portugal. They serve in New York City, Seattle, southern California, Phoenix, Texas, Florida, and other communities confronted by COVID-19. Their compassion for our patients and members has saved lives and helped make the lives of countless other people better. UnitedHealth Group was built to be adaptable, an instinctive enterprise capable of anticipating change, rapidly evolving and re-configuring capabilities to meet both challenges and opportunities. The past several months have only highlighted the importance of this agility so long core to how we operate, and deepened our resolve to cultivate it. We\u2019ve witnessed our people helping in ways and advancing innovations and solutions at an unprecedented pace, scope and scale.  Today, I\u2019d like to provide insights into how our business is both responding and advancing, share what we\u2019ve learned in the past several months, describe how these lessons enhance our ability to serve even more people more deeply, and as a result we expect to grow and emerge stronger in the years to come.  UnitedHealthcare and Optum have both experienced the effects of an unprecedented decline in healthcare services. Among early actions we undertook to help people were opening new enrolment periods so more people could be covered, waiving all consumer COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment costs, accelerating $2 billion in needed funding to care providers, and providing over $1.5 billion in direct consumer and customer assistance, including premium forgiveness and suspension of member cost sharing to help people manage their health conditions. These amounts are in addition to the $1 billion in estimated rebates to be paid in coming periods. Throughout this pandemic, we have taken extraordinary measures to ensure people get the essential care they need. As we speak with you today, care access patterns are nearing more normal levels, an encouraging sign for people\u2019s health. We see the system operating just short of its normal baseline now, far above the lows experienced as the second quarter began. We currently expect care access patterns, while somewhat more volatile than in the past, to moderately exceed normal baselines in the second half as people seek previously deferred care, and a pandemic with high testing and treatment costs per affected consumer is expected to continue to run its course throughout 2020 and into 2021. Consistent with the proactive actions we\u2019ve already undertaken, we will continue to act swiftly to address any further financial imbalances arising from the pandemic and related effects.  We are further advancing broad health equity initiatives tapping into our data, information and analytics capacities to guide scientific efforts to help eliminate longstanding health disparities. This is a course we have pursued for many years and are now even more intentional as we see underserved populations disproportionately impacted by this health crisis. We established an innovative community-based care model to provide COVID-19 testing, education and other necessary services to some of the highest risk and least served communities in the country. We are focusing on locations with high mortality along with local community challenges, including poverty, crowding, food insecurity, homelessness, and other existing social determinants of health. Our service includes special deployments in the underserved communities of Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Orleans Parish, alongside many other similar communities we serve through our core Medicare and Medicaid programs. We are researching new treatment approaches in partnership with prominent academic institutions. For example, working with the Morehouse School of Medicine, we\u2019re studying the effect of COVID-19 on those with sickle cell trait, a condition which is prevalent in 8% to 10% of Black Americans. We\u2019re conducting an ACE inhibitor virtual clinical trial with the Yale School of Medicine. Artificial intelligence applied to our data showed that seniors on ACE inhibitors who test positive for COVID-19 are 40% less likely to need hospitalizations than those who are not. Understanding that there\u2019s a significant racial disparity in the use of ACE inhibitors to manage hypertension, we\u2019re working rapidly to scale this 10,000 person virtual clinical trial, believed to be the first of its type. We\u2019re partnering with a growing number of state governments and employers who are using Optum\u2019s rapid response resources to stand up mobile and fixed testing sites. To date, we have helped conduct more than a half a million tests across more than 500 sites, most often in rural and underserved communities. We committed another $100 million in affordable housing to address homelessness, bringing our total investments to more than $500 million to build nearly 5,400 units over the past seven years, and we will do more, focused on working with others to eradicate longstanding health disparities in America and to create a more diverse U.S. health workforce. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the adoption of new technologies and approaches to care. We\u2019re serving people where they want to be served and more often in the home, which is becoming a preferred additional care setting, through new innovative digital offerings. At peak care system closure in April, UnitedHealthcare facilitated more than 4 million digital care visits, the number of visits we enabled in January. We expect digital and homecare to persist and expand in coming years. We are rapidly assembling our next generation comprehensive platform, leveraging the digital signaling and monitor capacities of Vivify, the market-leading engagement capabilities of Rally, our AI-enabled individual health record, the pharmacy ecommerce capabilities of OptumRx on community-based clinical resources, and importantly a proprietary, scalable direct to your own doctor\u2019s telemedicine platform.  The understandable and expected rise in stress, anxiety and social isolation [indiscernible] services, digital platforms are proving to be increasingly effective in remotely diagnosing and caring for people with such needs with a rapidly expanding scope. Optum is among the largest providers of digital behavioral healthcare services in the country, now with more than 10,000 care providers using our virtual visit platform. Our digital psychiatry offerings extend to community behavioral health clinics and [indiscernible] and complements our more than 500 community-based behavioral health pharmacies.  Optum nurses are meeting the increasing need for infusion services in the comfort and safety of people\u2019s homes, [indiscernible] will accelerate for years to come, and our nurses offer fully equivalent clinical efficacy, greater patient convenience and satisfaction, and reduced risk of immuno-compromised people at up to one half the cost of traditional settings, and our house call services include extensive digital clinical care visits supplementing in-home visits by Optum nurses.  As clinical techniques and technologies advance, ambulatory surgical care is expanding as an appropriate care setting for high acuity members and procedures, like cardiovascular surgeries. Partly as a result of convenience, safety, and better patient and surgeon experience [indiscernible]. For example, in just the last two months, [indiscernible] new surgeons to our centers and have opened new and higher acuity service lines. We [indiscernible] this care model to accelerate. The recent months have served as a compelling example of why care delivery has [indiscernible] OptumCare continues as a physician partner of choice with over 6,500 additional clinicians, primarily PCPs, specialists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants added so far this year. These clinicians are seeking alignment with the entity best equipped to help move to high performing and more stable accountable debt entity is OptumCare.  These are a few example of how we have and continue to innovate to help make people healthier to help make health systems work better for everyone. The information and technology capacities of Optum, leveraged and deployed by United Healthcare and other payors in other health systems holds significant promise for the future of the U.S. health system.  Now I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you Dave. As expected, our [indiscernible] impacted by unprecedented and far reaching disruption in care patterns. We expect this temporary impact [indiscernible] by the proactive assistance measures we have already taken, the resumption of more normal care patterns, and future COVID-19 impacts both within the healthcare sector and the economy at large. Looking more specifically, Optum revenue and earnings for fee-for-service care delivery and the OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based businesses [indiscernible]. For the company as a whole, this was more than offset by the disrupted care patterns within the United Healthcare and the Optum Health risk-based businesses.  Prior period development of $1.4 billion arose primarily from the lower than expected care levels in the second half of March, contributing to the lower medical care ratio this quarter. The impact of this care disruption is reduced by factors such as COVID-related treatment and testing and the financial assistance we are providing. Notably, the assistance component has a more [indiscernible]. For example, the suspension of member cost share will have an accelerating benefit and corresponding impact for the people we serve as care delivery systems further reopen and they seek care again.  At the lowest point in April, in-patient care inclusive of COVID-19 related care was [indiscernible]. In June, this recovered to nearly 95%. At the same lowest point, outpatient and physician services fell to roughly 60% of normal levels. As we exited [indiscernible] tracking above 90%. These national trends [indiscernible] even as certain states are seeing short-term deferral of services where there are elevated levels of infection and hospitalization.  [Indiscernible] each of the three businesses performed well, while they were affected in different ways by care deferral and the economic downturn. Second quarter earnings increased 22% year-over-year. The impact of the lower patient [indiscernible] mostly offset by the same temporary deferral of care effects on [indiscernible]. OptumInsight second quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year while the revenue backlog grew by nearly $1 billion to $19.4 billion. Many of OptumInsights payor and care provider clients have volume-based contracts for technology and managed services. After an expected slowing of such volumes early in the second quarter due to care deferral, we\u2019re now seeing activity rebound and [indiscernible] again, as evidenced by the new partnership with Boulder Community [indiscernible]. OptumRx earnings declined by 6% year-over-year in the second quarter as script volumes were impacted by [indiscernible]. Unsurprisingly given the sharp drop in primary care and specialist visits, first fills of prescriptions declined by about one-third early in the second quarter, but began to recover as the quarter progressed and have continued to do so as care activity increases.  Turning to UnitedHealthcare, second quarter operating earnings were significantly higher due to the temporary care [indiscernible] continue to serve more people through our public sector and senior businesses, including an increase through the second quarter of nearly 600,000 people year to date. As [indiscernible] commercial enrolment declined, albeit [indiscernible] might have suggested [indiscernible] for furloughed employees.  During the second quarter, growth in sales of individual polices and Medicaid membership accelerated, the latter as states eased redetermination requirements to ensure sustainable coverage for people. We were also awarded contracts to serve Medicaid members in Kentucky in 2021, serve the Medicaid population in Indiana, and are pleased to continue serving in Philadelphia. After a strong annual enrolment period for Medicare Advantage, the pacing of new enrollees in April and May eased as traditional in-person sales slowed. Sales have accelerated with the current level of Medicare Advantage enrollment activity having rebounded to [indiscernible]. Our liquidity and financial position have remained strong [indiscernible] reached $10 billion or 1.5 times net earnings. Both cash flows and days and clients payable were impacted by the swift moves we undertook to provide enhanced liquidity by accelerating payments to individual care providers and health systems. Offsetting this impact was the timing of second quarter income tax payments, which will now occur in the third quarter. As noted in our press release this morning, we are maintaining our full year earnings per share outlook in anticipation of the delivery of previously deferred and potentially even higher acuity care as well as continued costs to address COVID-19 in the second half of the year. We are encouraged by the rapid pacing of the reopening of care delivery systems and are proactively working to help people quickly obtain the care they need. In addition, we incorporate a second half view for a more pronounced impact from the consumer, customer and care provider assistance initiatives already undertaken. As Dave stated, we will act to address further imbalances, should they arise over the duration of this pandemic. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you John. Today in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, foremost on our minds is the safely of our team members and their families and the need to continue adapting rapidly, innovating and delivering for those we serve. [Indiscernible] begin to focus at this time on what will come in 2021 and beyond. At this distance, the evolution of the pandemic, when and to what extent the economy will improve are very much open questions. We expect the macroeconomic impacts of the broader unemployment and actions we have taken to assist customers and communities to continue well into next year. Helping our customers through an unexpected macro environment and the extended impact from disruptions in care has and will continue to be an area of intense focus for our business leaders and care providers. During this period, our diversified businesses are creating unique opportunities to serve, and we don\u2019t believe these are just passing trends. They bring more effective clinical outcomes, satisfaction and convenience for people at lower cost, a significant contribution to the next generation health system, one that operates in a socially conscious way. These are accelerating and durable trends, well supportive of our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective in the years to come.  Public sector and senior benefits programs, our care delivery businesses, our digital and at-home based initiatives, pharmacy care services, data and analytics, and health banking and payment platforms will continue contributing as significant growth factors long into the future.  Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you please open the lines for questions? \nOperator: [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow up on your comments on second half medical costs. You talked about getting back to about 90% of typical in June, or a little above 90%, and you\u2019re expecting north of 100% of second half, so was hoping you could put some numbers around a few things. First, how much above normal do you expect to be in the back half of the year, how much of a headwind do you expect the patient and client give-backs to be in the back half in terms of the headwind MLR, the impact to MLR, and then can you talk about how you price in 2021 in terms of utilization? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, well maybe we\u2019ll start with John and then as it relates to 2021, I\u2019m sure you can talk about the commercial markets, and we\u2019ll have Dirk address that. \nJustin Lake: Medicare would be great as well, Dave. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, John Rex here, Justin. Just a few comments here in terms of medical cost ratio and the impacts of customer assistance and how they flow through the year. Yes, you are right - clearly we expect higher than historically normal medical cost ratios as we move into the second quarter of the year, and that\u2019s certainly implied in our maintained guidance view. You can see as you look at it versus historical levels of a typical second half, we\u2019re running in the zone of a couple hundred basis points above what we would consider kind of historical medical cost ratios in the second half of the year, to kind of give you a little color in terms of how that flows through. In terms of the customer assistance initiatives and how those play out, among some of the more significant customer assistance initiatives that we are taking on are the waiving of co-pays for seniors for both primary care and very importantly on the specialist component, as that\u2019s a very significant burden for seniors. Those really have much more impact as we get into the second half from the perspective of as care delivery systems reopen, that\u2019s when those costs will be incurred, so you\u2019re incurring those costs as seniors and people are really accessing that care, and that\u2019s where the assistance component comes in. That component, which is one of the more significant components of the customer assistance initiatives we\u2019ve undertaken, is really more weighted to the back half of the year than the first half of the year.\nDavid Wichmann: Great, thank you. Then as it relates to pricing, I think we\u2019ll start with Medicare with Tim Noel and then we\u2019ll go to commercial with Bill Golden. Tim?\nTim Noel: Morning Justin, Tim Noel, thanks for the question. As we talked a little bit last quarter about pricing for 2021 in Medicare, and as a reminder, pre-COVID we talked about total revenue related items roughly on part with our estimates of forward trend, and we also have the repeal, the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax in 2021, so if you take those things, all else equal we would expect that 2021 to be a benefit investment year on the Medicare Advantage. Certainly COVID creates some challenges with diagnosis collection, given the utilization patterns that we\u2019re seeing and talking about, and also CMS has not provided any discrete adjustments in the final notice to account for that, nor have they done anything since. It\u2019s still too early to get specific on our bid offerings for 2021. Bids aren\u2019t final, nor are they public; but again, our top priority is providing stable and reliable benefits for the members that we serve, and we feel really good about 2021 and expect to continue our multi-year momentum in Medicare Advantage. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thanks Tim. I\u2019d just add to that, I think the way the year is setting up, and I know it\u2019s relatively early, but in terms of the overall positioning is to continue the pace of growth that we have been seeing across the individual Medicare Advantage lines, and then obviously we\u2019re deeply focused on the group Medicare market and growth there as well. Bill Golden, do you want to handle commercial?\nBill Golden: Sure, thanks Dave, and thanks for the question. We\u2019re going to continue our longstanding approach to pricing - you know, we\u2019re disciplined and we\u2019re pricing to our best estimate of future cost trends. We have extensively modeled the potential impact to covid-19, including our testing and treatment costs, potential vaccine costs, and costs that will be expected to be deferred into 2021, which includes the potential higher severity because of the deferred care and also the potential for continued depressed demand for healthcare services in some regions and states. All this is built into our forward view of medical cost trends, and we\u2019re working very closely with our customers right now into August as we start to put out our renewals for 2021. Our clients are really expecting and appreciating consistent and stable pricing from us.  Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you Bill, and thank you Justin for your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about the impact on the physician side and Optum Health, OptumCare, specifically the recruitment of physicians and maybe how that\u2019s changed. I think there was an allusion in the press release to maybe an acceleration of bringing in more primary care and maybe some talk on specialty. Then can you flesh out sort of within that, within OptumCare, the impact was a lot lower than I think we had expected. I heard John mention the risk-based entities offsetting the fee-for-service entities. Can you just give us a magnitude on that and how much the UnitedHealthcare payments impact, sort of how did OptumCare hold up so well?\nDavid Wichmann: Good questions, Josh, appreciate them. We did try to lean into this a little bit in the script in terms of giving a general impression that there\u2019s a kind of movement afoot of physicians, advanced practice clinicians towards stable models that allow them to preserve their independence practice at the top of their license, achieve the triple-A in the healthcare, and we\u2019ve clearly seen that. Then we\u2019ve also, as you probably can suspect, had a fair agenda around inorganic build to access new geographies, and we\u2019ve made a decent amount of progress on that front during this time frame as well.  But I think I\u2019ll send it to Wyatt Decker here, he can talk a little bit about the value proposition of OptumCare and what people are seeking at this important time, and why this model is the one that they are pursuing. Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Dave, thanks, and Josh, thanks for the question. You\u2019re absolutely right, Dave - we have seen continued interest and growth in our OptumCare model, which has become really the nation\u2019s predominant physician-led, value-based, patient-centered ambulatory medical practice. That may sound like a mouthful, but it\u2019s really focused on doing what\u2019s right for patients, delivering care in both more convenient and lower cost settings in a value-based construct, keeping the patient at the center of everything we do. We\u2019ve seen, to the second question, Josh, around the performance of OptumCare, we\u2019ve seen that our large geographic footprint combined with our both risk-based and fee-for-service model has created substantial resiliency in the business, and as John Rex mentioned, we saw some countervailing financial performances when fee-for-service got quieter during the peak of the pandemic. We\u2019re now seeing very rapid recovery in part because of our tremendous support of our frontline providers. The other piece that I would want to underscore is our incredible gratitude to our frontline providers that have done an incredible job caring for both COVID patients and helping us effectively navigate through this complex pandemic. Your first question around ongoing recruitment of physician groups and individual physicians, your implied assumption is correct - we are seeing substantial interest in our practice model as well as in becoming part of OptumCare, and this is part of a multi-year trend that we have continued to grow, and as you know, we have relationships with multiple physician groups that are either affiliated or employed today, over 52,000 doctors in both categories combined, and we have seen continued interest and expect a pipeline of affiliated and employed physicians to grow robustly. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you Josh, appreciate your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Well go next to AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAJ Rice: Hi everybody. Maybe just to ask, a number of your business lines - commercial, large group commercial, OptumRx and OptumInsight are driven by large RFP activity, and I wonder--I think last time you had alluded to the fact that especially in OptumInsight, some of that RFP activity had been put on hold. Can you comment about how it\u2019s returned to normal? Is this going to end up being a normal year in those segments, or are you seeing people put off for a year making large decisions until there\u2019s some clarity around what\u2019s happening with the pandemic?\nDavid Wichmann: Sure, well why don\u2019t we give you color from a number of different angles here, AJ. We\u2019ll start with Dirk to give you a sense of what\u2019s going on with UnitedHealthcare and their self-funded business and the RFP activity there, and maybe even as it relates to some of the government programs based business, then I\u2019m going to pivot over to John Prince to talk about Rx, and then Robert Musslewhite to comment on the activities in the market segments of OptumInsight. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, thanks Dave. AJ, hi. As I look at national accounts and I think about this selling season, what we really saw was that we\u2019re about 60 days behind normal in terms of people making decisions for 1/1/21. As we sit here today, not all the decisions have been made, and as we handicap our wins and losses, what we expect will be roughly flat to a little bit up in terms of group wins and losses for 1/1/21, but really the tale is going to be told with respect to national accounts as to what attrition occurs throughout the remainder of the year.  I think that\u2019s really it. I would say in terms of general RFP activity, I think I would say that in national accounts, these sorts of things just progressed, just at a little bit slower than what we had seen previously.  As it relates to Medicaid, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim Spilker, who will just give us quick thoughts on the RFP activity in \u2018caid.\nTim Spilker: Yes, thanks Dirk, and thanks for the question. Yes, we\u2019re excited about the activity that we\u2019re seeing. As we mentioned earlier, both Kentucky and Indiana were really nice wins, and of course we were thrilled to see that North Carolina finalized its Medicaid funding for a 7/1/21 start. So understandably, as you suggested, states have delayed some of their procurement timelines, but overall we\u2019re starting to see those pick up here over the next couple of months. We believe our value proposition is strong and well positioned for growth, and we\u2019ll be ready for those procurements as they come through.\nDavid Wichmann: By the way, that was Tim Spilker. He\u2019s our new CEO of Community & State. You probably recall that Heather Cianfrocco was the former CEO. She was promoted to oversee Optum Health\u2019s health services sector as its leader, and as you might suspect, we are positioning some of our strongest leaders into the Optum Health segment given the rapid growth expectations of that business over the next decade or so.  Maybe just touch on group Medicare too. Brian Thompson, you want to touch on that?\nBrian Thompson: Yes, thanks Dave. As we look forward, group Medicare Advantage is shaping up to be a very strong year to 2021. Obviously a lot of large customers looking for value as they go through this time, and we\u2019re really encouraged by a strong pipeline and some wins, and feeling very good about next year in that space as well. \nDavid Wichmann: Yes, the team has done really well in the government program space around growth, and they have a substantial amount of momentum and continue to capitalize on that momentum going forward. John Prince, you want to touch on Rx?\nJohn Prince: Sure. Hey AJ, it\u2019s John Prince. As you know, in the OptumRx business we\u2019re in the middle of our selling season right now. We continue to have a very healthy pipeline and are very excited about the opportunities in the market. In the first half of the year, we had some good wins, especially in the commercial market, the labor market and the health plan market. As we pivot to the back half of the year, we\u2019re more in the smaller size opportunities. As we look to the big opportunities we\u2019re pursuing right now, most of them are for 2022 selling season, so there is a robust pipeline for 2022. As you know, in the health plan business, this is the time frame where they make those types of decisions. In terms of movement in the market, we\u2019re going to see less movement in the 2021 selling season, as we have seen in previous years. Overall, I think our retention is going to be very strong, as it has been for the last four years. We\u2019re going to be tracking to the high 90s, as we\u2019ve been tracking before, so we\u2019re going to see strong growth. I think our story is resonating in the market. We\u2019re seeing strong focus on client affordability, our tools around making sure members stay healthy and get healthy, and creating a great client experience, so overall strong growth in the market. \nDavid Wichmann: Then I\u2019ll ask Robert Musslewhite to round it up here, really talking about both the activity with health systems, who have been extremely busy, and then also with health plans.\nRobert Musslewhite: On the provider side of the business, and thanks AJ for the question, we have felt like while there\u2019s certainly been some disruption during the quarter in some of our smaller technology deals, on the larger deals the pipeline continues to be strong and interest remains high. Given what\u2019s happened with health systems during the quarter, we think that these larger comprehensive partnerships will continue to be very attractive to health systems that align with us across our commitment to total cost of care reductions and affordability, patient quality, and consumer centricity. These types of partnerships, as we\u2019ve seen in the past, not only help mitigate liquidity and cash flow issues in the near term, but importantly accelerate the broader transformational clinical and structure work in the medium and longer term. In that light, we\u2019re particularly pleased to be, having announced yesterday our partnership with Boulder Community Health, which is again a comprehensive new relationship focused on multiple things, including and importantly sharing outcomes in the clinical domain, and really see this as indicative of the broader pipeline that we see across our health system clients. We feel very good about the ability to continue to support them there. On the payor side, again a similar story. Obviously there have been places during the quarter where we\u2019ve had some impact on payors\u2019 willingness to step forward with large deals, but still feel very good about the pipeline going forward where we\u2019re able to provide a lot of value and support to our payor partners going forward, and feel good about the pipeline there in the second half of the year.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you Robert. AJ, hopefully that was responsive. Thank you for the question.  Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open. \nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking questions. Just wanted to follow up on someone\u2019s earlier question. If we think about the additional billion dollar and premium rebates you guys are looking to push out, should we think about that as a starting point for additional rebates, and what\u2019s the timing as we think that runs through the P&L? As we think about that, are there some states, I think that are excluded since--you know, we\u2019ve spoken with some experts, they suggest some states have anti-kickback or anti-rebate rules that limit your ability to rebate premiums back intra-year. Can you give us some thoughts around that, how that kind of plays out across your business? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Sure, so the additional billion--or the billion in premium rebates is a best estimate at this point in time. As these things move and we continue to deal with the evolution of the pandemic, as well as the impacts on the economy, that number will shift around. It\u2019s required to be reflected in your results on a current term basis, so it\u2019s reflected in the results that you see so far year-to-date, so it\u2019s already through.  Then as it relates to rebates, yes, there are anti-kickback rules, and all those things we have a very complex set of engagements that we need to make with insurance commissioners and others to make sure that we can return these funds. We have engaged in that and have been successful at getting concurrence with them around providing these rebates. Obviously it\u2019s a lot easier to give money back than it is to ask for new, and so they\u2019ve been very receptive and very collaborative and extremely appreciative that we were as proactive as we were and as early as we were in providing needed relief to our commercial members, as well as the actions that we took on the Medicare front. Thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Great, thanks for the question. Maybe I just wanted to ask on dis-enrolment, enrolment in the commercial and Medicaid books. It seems like the heightened unemployment environment has obviously having an impact on commercial enrolment, so I was hoping maybe you could share your thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about this enrolment in the commercial book in the back half.  Then relatedly, do you feel that so far you\u2019ve been able to capture commensurate market share on the increased Medicaid market, particularly as we think about recent evidence that previously furloughed employees are becoming more permanently laid off and potentially, obviously, entering that Medicaid space?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, so what we\u2019re seeing so far is a lot of furloughs versus layoffs to reduce costs in the short term. In many cases, clearly this allows them to maintain medical benefits throughout. What also has benefited our overall enrolment is the impact of the stimulus actions. The impact on commercial enrolment hasn\u2019t been as great as we would have otherwise thought based on the unemployment data, just because of the stimulus as well as the furloughs. We\u2019re looking and we\u2019re continuing to work with our broker partners and with our employers to try to find folks--to try to find other coverages for folks if they don\u2019t stay in commercial.  What I would say is in the Medicaid space, what we\u2019ve seen so far is the redeterminations have been put on hold, so we\u2019ll see. People go to our commercial products as we--our individual products as we pace forward, and we have a fairly broad commercial and individual products as well, so we may be able to recapture our share, but there\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s going to be sort of delayed impact because of the stimulus actions and it will be a little bit more pronounced in the second half, but we think we\u2019ve held our own so far. Thank you Robert. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. [Indiscernible] cost shifts between \u201920 and \u201921. How much of the [indiscernible] \u201920 versus \u201921, is there any SG&A that can be pulled forward into \u201920 from \u201921, and are you making any changes in completion factor assumptions? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: John Rex?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Sarah, how are you doing? A few things, comments on that in terms of just thinking about how those costs play out. I guess I\u2019d first point out, as you can appreciate, we\u2019re quite respectful of the highly fluid situation and mindful of how rapidly the situation is evolving. [Indiscernible] sets up a view that as the maintained earnings outlook would imply [indiscernible] the carrier that we had expected to be delivered in 2020, you know, we look into the back half of the year. [Indiscernible] that way or not, or whether as you suggest, some of that moves into 2021 also is in part a component of how quickly systems, health delivery systems reopen and how fully they stay open, and also just the consumer preference in terms of their comfort of going into these settings. All those are elements that play out in this thing, so we\u2019re being quite respectful of that situation as we look forward on that and how that plays out into \u201921. Certainly some of that could end up in \u201921. In terms of cost, I think what you\u2019re referring to is investments that we would choose to make being heavily, and we\u2019re investing heavily in part in response to COVID-19 and in response to the pandemic. You probably saw some of that even in our operating cost ration this quarter in terms of the investments we\u2019re making on a current period basis to serve people and to enhance and strengthen our capabilities as we look forward. Those are the main components that I\u2019d point out in terms of how we\u2019re acting and how we\u2019re looking ahead to serve.\nDavid Wichmann: And Sarah, one of the things we did was we maintained our full workforce, so nobody\u2019s been laid off or furloughed or dismissed because of COVID-19, and in part because we knew that on the other side of this initial activity that the health system would come back online and consumers would be accessing care, so we needed to make sure that we were prepared to respond to the market demands just as quickly as possible.  Because of all that, the service through this time period, we [indiscernible] virtually all the lines of business at Optum and the same thing with--I\u2019m sorry, UnitedHealthcare and the same with Optum. We\u2019ve seen a nice improvement, so we\u2019re making sure that we utilize this time well and make those investments provide the right kinds of returns, so that we\u2019re creating additional trust with the marketplace. I think that\u2019s playing out nicely.  Thank you for your question, Sarah. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can talk a bit about the NaviHealth deal and give us an update maybe on your broader post-acute strategy. Just in particular, interested around whether you would envision Optum moving further to continue to acquire more direct home health and provider assets, or whether you would see the strategy for post acute being more of a convener, like NaviHealth is right now. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I think a little bit of both. Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Yes Scott, thanks for the question. First, I would tell you how excited we are and pleased we are to welcome the team of NaviHealth to Optum United Health Group. Second, I would say just to frame it, when you look at seniors in the United States, there\u2019s over a $60 billion spend in the post acute space, which historically has not been well managed both in terms of the patient experience and expenses. We think there is a tremendous opportunity, and you can look forward with NaviHealth as well as our own capabilities and our colleagues at Sound Physicians, which is a hospital staffing group focused on hospitalists who are very engaged in the post acute transition, to continue to build capabilities to help both patients and people manage that post hospitalization period with the best outcomes and the best experience. More to come, but we\u2019re very excited about this combination of our colleagues at NaviHealth.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, we leaned in a lot to the digital activities and the way in which we\u2019re engaging or assembling our resources across our company to really create a unique and distinctive home clinical experience. That includes the engagement of our physical resources, our nurses that already go into homes, so I could see us very much being a home through ambulatory, surgical capacity company. As it relates to the home in particular, our interest would be primarily in deploying skilled health services, so we would not be as inclined around the other home-based care services around ADL management and things of that nature. We probably would continue our focus on skilled clinical resources.  Thanks for the question, Scott. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. My guess is that at this point, you\u2019re not going to give a point estimate, but just want to conceptually understand about next year\u2019s earnings. This year, you\u2019ve done a lot to make sure that you don\u2019t capitalize on COVID, making sure that you serve the customers and the providers to make sure that you\u2019re not earning more than what your guidance was going to be this year. As we think about next year, is there conceptually any reason why you wouldn\u2019t expect to be earning target margins on your different products? If we\u2019re still hitting a recession but didn\u2019t have COVID, would you expect to be hitting the same kind of margins you normally would in a scenario like that, or is there any reason to believe that next year\u2019s margins across your businesses would be somehow different than normal?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, it\u2019s really hard to tell. We normally don\u2019t give guidance at this stage, Kevin, for 2021. Sometimes we give impressions, but given the volatility of the market as it stands right now and more the near term focus that we have in making sure that we\u2019re serving our patients, members, customers, and then keeping our people safe, including 120,000 clinical resources out on the front line of care, we\u2019re just not really in a position to talk about 2021. We\u2019ll probably give you some sense of that in the Q3 call, but maybe not quite as clear as what we may have given in the past, just looking forward. I would see our investor conference as being the place where I think we can give you the best sense of things. As it relates to our core performance of our businesses, they\u2019re performing well. We\u2019re not talking about their individual performances anymore because there is nothing normal about how any of them are performing at this stage. Collectively, they\u2019re doing a great job and they\u2019re right on expectations, and they\u2019re right on the expectations that informed the guidance that we gave you back in December, maybe a little bit ahead. So they\u2019re performing really well, I just don\u2019t think at this time it\u2019s the right time for us to be thinking about where we\u2019ll land in 2021 on margins. We\u2019ll try to do a better job of that for you in the Q3 call and in the conference later this winter.  Thank you Kevin. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser : Yes, hi. Good morning. As we had into the election, we\u2019re getting a lot of questions from investors around a potential public option. Can you maybe discuss your thoughts on the dynamics of the health insurer market should a public option be instituted? \nDavid Wichmann: Sure Ricky, thank you for the question. I\u2019ll just go ahead and take it. We\u2019ve seen at the state level some indications of efforts around public options. I think the one that\u2019s probably most prominent is the one that occurred in the State of Washington, which ended up being an augmentation of their exchange, a set of product offerings on that. You probably have noticed that we bid and we were one of the successful bidders, and are currently in contract negotiations to provide an offering on that exchange. What\u2019s interesting about that from our standpoint is that we have a very strong relationship with the State of Washington. We have significant care delivery capacities in that state and we serve 220,000 Medicaid and over 40,000 dually eligible individuals as well. There is kind of a unique program design there that really uses, I\u2019ll call it roughly a reference based pricing, and we\u2019re curious to see how we perform in competing on a reference based pricing basis because it\u2019s not unusual for us to have a disadvantage on discounts when we\u2019re competing [indiscernible] given the size and significance of those players in the overall market. We actually think this will be a nice test to see what the [indiscernible] our business will be. Generally speaking, we\u2019re not a strong supporter of these public option proposals, and primarily because they disrupt current coverage platforms which consumers value and appreciate. We believe there\u2019s a near universal coverage system already in America today. It\u2019s obviously not complete and it has some gaps, but we believe those gaps can be closed and think that consumers much prefer that we leverage the existing commercial Medicare and Medicaid markets to provide the types of coverage options and coverages that are necessary for America. The areas that [indiscernible] around Medicaid, and we\u2019re obviously strong supporters of the states that have not expanded to expand, we believe Medicaid is a strong coverage option for--you know, encourage [indiscernible] that occurs. The other area would be that we see a lot of the uninsured are actually folks that have an affordable coverage option available to them, but they don\u2019t necessarily enroll, and particularly in Medicare where there\u2019s--Medicaid, excuse me, where there\u2019s about 8.5 million people that are currently uninsured but have Medicaid option available to them, so we\u2019d be strong proponents of passive enrollment as well to ensure that Americans are getting the coverages that are made available to them by states, federal governments, and the private insurance system. With that, thank you for the question, Ricky. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Back of the envelope type math for the full year, EPS guidance to remain at [indiscernible] MLR in the back half of 2021 would have to be maybe somewhere in the 80s [indiscernible]. I guess really my question is just given the trends that you\u2019re seeing in June and July around utilization, I guess I\u2019m curious whether you\u2019re generally assuming that the MLRs will be fairly consistent in both third quarter and fourth quarter, or would you perhaps see more of your proactive spending gravitate more towards the fourth quarter when thinking about the mechanics of this for the back half? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Yes, good morning Steven. A few impacts going on as we think about the progression. Definitely there are the proactive actions that we\u2019re taking to help people that have impact in the quarters here. Typically we would think about there still being a ramp, though, in terms of the system reopening, so as we--as we exited June and we were trying to give you as much clarity and transparency as we could in terms of what we\u2019re seeing real time, seeing systems reopening, that at this point they\u2019re still not fully open. They are getting close, they are near normal, but not what we\u2019d call fully reopened. That will continue to track over the course of the second half, and we would continue that, so I would expect there would be some trajectory that would go on just from that component as those reopen.  Creating some offset in that, certainly we have a lot of actions also that are impacting and will impact in the near term as they come on and seniors are able to access care and move through using the co-pay eliminations that we\u2019ve put into place. All of those have quite a bit of impact. At this distance, I would tell you we\u2019re kind of in the--just given the variability, we\u2019re kind of in a zone where those impacts probably have offsetting impacts, and we\u2019re kind of sitting in a zone of we\u2019d look for relatively consistent levels throughout. Typically we have more--you know, you get a little more impact, though, as you get into 4Q. Our historical patterns would show that. \nSteven Valiquette: Okay, appreciate the extra color. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you Steven. We have time for just a couple more questions. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Ralph Jacoby [ph] with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Jacoby: Thanks, good morning. You mentioned June returning to near normal levels, but I think I heard John also say that it continued into July despite the COVID spikes. Is that correct, and why do you think that would be the case versus retrenching again? Then you mentioned acuity. Any help on how meaningful a driver that could be on trend in the second half, given deferral, and if you\u2019ve already seen that? Thanks. \nJohn Rex: Morning Ralph, John Rex. Yes, you\u2019re accurate in terms of my commentary in the prepared comments here. The trends we\u2019re referring to are national trends. You are absolutely correct - if we were to go into pockets, into certain metro regions in the country where you\u2019ve seen some spiking in terms of infection rates and such, we\u2019re seeing impact in those particular regions, but those are very particular regions in terms of that [indiscernible]. When we\u2019re talking about what we\u2019re seeing through July, it\u2019s very much at a national level in terms of impact.  Dirk has a little additional color commentary also. \nDirk McMahon: I would say we would expect the infection rates to ebb and flow based on geography [indiscernible] broad-based shutdown. Those places where that ebb and flow occurs, we would expect [indiscernible] impact. Obviously [indiscernible] more markets individual [indiscernible] but overall, like we said on the call today, utilization is going to come back during the second half of the year.\nJohn Rex: And Ralph, on your question on acuity, a little too soon to really call that one right now. When we expect individuals with chronic conditions that have missed treatments, and as they come back into the system and coming back potentially with a higher acuity level, it\u2019s a little too soon to really be seeing that in the current trending that we are looking at as we sit here today. It really isn\u2019t showing up yet, but we expect that to show up as systems continue to reopen, and really importantly, consumer comfort level increases.\nDirk McMahon: I mean, it\u2019s kind of hard to ignore the number of new diagnoses that dropped off. It\u2019s hard to ignore the drop-off in heart attack, stroke. You can imagine it was fear of consumers going to an ER that caused them not to access the health system, so we--it may be speculative here, but I think the data that we see suggests that there will be some intensity in the services that people receive. We\u2019re prepared to make sure that we facilitate them receiving those services.\nOperator: [Indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning guys, and thanks for sneaking me in at the end. I guess just to wrap it up, could you guys talk a little bit about the AbleTo acquisition, kind of how you think it fits into your primary care delivery model that you guys have constructed, your other telehealth partnerships, and the digital health initiatives? Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Wyatt, you want to take it?\nWyatt Decker: You bet. We\u2019re also very pleased to welcome the team from AbleTo, and as you alluded, there is enormous capabilities there in providing [indiscernible] to those suffering from mild, moderate, and in some cases even severe behavioral and substance use disorder conditions. [Indiscernible] leverage the capabilities in a more comprehensive fashion with other capabilities, including [indiscernible] care, which we have seen an enormous uptick in as well. Today, [indiscernible] visits, over half are being provided in the outpatient setting using digital capabilities, and AbleTo has very sophisticated tools that allow individuals to address their behavior healthcare needs, so we\u2019re very pleased about the partnership and we look forward to continuing to build out both their and our capabilities. Finally, to your point about embedded solutions in primary care, we have begun that journey, and in fact within OptumCare you\u2019ll find a number of our practices have embraced this today and able to provide more advanced capabilities to use digital tools in that setting as well. So yes, we will continue that integration.  Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, both NaviHealth and AbleTo are organizations that we\u2019ve aligned to in the past, so we have a history of a strong working relationship and knowledge--good strong, intimate knowledge of the performance of these businesses and where their innovative capacities lie. They just have really strong management teams and do a very good job managing their respective markets. Thank you for your engagement today. This is a unique time in our history and in the history of healthcare. As you have come to expect from us, we will continue to meet this unprecedented environment with the highest level of integrity, compassion, and agility. UnitedHealth Group is built to be an adaptable company, and as we\u2019ve seen in the past several months, you can expect the following from us, that we will continue to lean into challenges of the current environment with the full capacity of this enterprise and proactively seek ways to collaborate and partner with others.  As we work together to serve society through COVID-19, we will fairly resolve any economic imbalances that may arise while we continue to lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way so that everyone can be served equally, one person, one provider, one health system at a time. With your continued support, we expect to grow and emerge an even stronger company in the years to come. Thank you. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 1, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-04-15 15:02:35", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Here's some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risk and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the earnings reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 15, 2020, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wichmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With all that is going on, we've structured things a bit differently today. We'll get directly to what's likely top of mind for all of you, the impact of COVID-19, global health crisis on our businesses and the actions we're taking to support our communities, members, patients, care providers, customers, government partners, and team members and their family. These are still the early days in the response to COVID-19 and we anticipate we will experience and learn more as events unfold in the months ahead. UnitedHealth Group was consciously built, with the restless mindset, adaptable capabilities, culture and the enduring human values to respond and serve in meeting challenges such as we are seeing today. The commitment, ingenuity, compassion and engagement of the 325,000 people of UnitedHealth Group has never been stronger. I'll start today by expressing my gratitude and admiration to this restless team for the extraordinary efforts and personal sacrifices being made every day. They are doctors, nurses, pharmacists, social workers and other clinical and nonclinical healthcare workers on the front lines of care, as well as customer care representatives, transaction processors, supply chain experts, technology engineers, data scientists and others supporting them, the health system and our communities. The COVID-19 pandemic is deeply personal to them and to all of us. They're connected digitally, triaging people with symptoms, engaging directly with our most vulnerable patients, ensuring essential chronic and COVID-19 related medical and behavioral health services are available and accessed, while helping keep the health system coordinated, connected and working for individuals and their doctors. They're enhancing safety for those most at risk, making sure the right medicines are getting to the right patients, when and where they need it, and the right testing and protective gear is available to properly safeguard the health workforce. They're driving innovative solutions around testing, healthcare workforce safety, improving critical product supply and services availability, helping develop and evaluate therapies and applying advanced analytics to identify, predict and combat COVID-19. For our heroic clinical team, we have further hardened our safety first workforce environment for those caring for patients across our more than 1,500 facilities and those providing medications and services caring for people in their homes. Like all of us, they are concerned about the health and safety of their own families and friends. Yet, they remain front and center engaging fully each day to serve many selflessly away from their families for weeks, so they can ensure care is provided to those most in need. I have never been more proud or more humbled to be on their team. Every team member at UnitedHealth Group remains fully employed, supported, protected and engaged in the COVID-19 crisis. Let me pause to acknowledge and add a note of deep gratitude to Andrew Witty, who has announced this morning will be taking a leave of absence to provide leadership for the efforts of the World Health Organization to find and distribute a vaccine for COVID-19. Our gratitude for Andrew is grounded in all he has done to guide the UnitedHealth Group and Optum so effectively and sensitively for all who we serve and all who work at this enterprise and his willingness to apply his leadership and phenomenal talents to this new assignment for which he is so aptly suited. We couldn't be more proud to call one of our own to see one of our own serve in this way and we look forward to both his success in leading this effort and his return to our company once this important work is done. He is on the call with us today and available to respond to your questions before he reports to duty with the World Health Organization. From the outset of COVID-19 outbreak, we mobilized to keep our entire enterprise fully intact and functioning at the highest performance levels. As we stand today, we are supporting all of our products, services and commitments across all of our businesses and markets. We have long had a high proportion of our more than 200,000 person, nonclinical team working from home and we were able to quickly move nearly all of the rest to work at home as well. They have been performing well and our service levels remain strong for our clients, members, patients and the health system broadly. For the millions of people we are privileged to serve through United HealthCare. We have taken every step possible to broaden access to care. We have offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer sponsored offerings, eliminated all COVID-19 related cost sharings and removed prior authorizations to speed patient transitions of care, so health systems can diagnose, treat, and redirect patients. We have developed revised payment timeframes to help people sustain coverage and we are helping people displaced from their job to smoothly transition to affordable coverage which meets their needs. Last week we moved to provide nearly $2 billion in liquidity to the health system, accelerating payments to care providers whose clinical operations have been impacted. We have been partnering with other companies and academic institutions to develop and validate protocols and processes to more rapidly and frequently test healthcare professionals on the frontline, applying new technology to ensure safe and full availability of this critical workforce. This leverages the self-administered collection innovation we developed, which is simplifying COVID-19 testing and we have been tracking infectious disease pattern to identify supply-demand inequities and resource needs in every major metropolitan statistical area across the U.S. health system. This will emerge as a new capability to provide enhanced disease surveillance in the future. Our high-risk members have been identified and we are surrounding them with services to reduce the impacts of social isolation on their access to physical and behavioral care, while keeping them as safe as possible. And we have provided over $50 million in initial domestic and global grant funding and investments to advance health workforce safety, support those in geographies most afflicted, aid seniors secluded in their homes, and help communities address rising levels of homelessness and food and security. Like the broader health system in recent weeks, we have seen a reduction in elective care, which is impacting both the UnitedHealthcare benefits and the OptumCare delivery businesses. Most traditional procedure work has been postponed at our SCA ambulatory surgery centers. Likewise, the UnitedHealthcare and Optum at-risk care delivery businesses have seen lower demand for these services. We are seeing timeframes and discussions for new business opportunities being extended as most business partners focus on crisis response. Many employers have had to furlough employees, driving higher levels of unemployment, which may ultimately affect the outlook for growth in our Group Benefits business, while increasing our membership in individual lines and Medicaid coverages. While it feels awkward to be talking about earnings outlook at this moment, you saw our press release; we are maintaining our 2020 earnings per share outlook established at our Investor Conference. We view this as the most reasonable baseline posture in these uncertain times as we continue to grow and operate our businesses, while assessing the multitude of potentially offsetting factors across our uniquely diverse enterprise. These factors will become clear in the months to come. The related financial effects on our business will clarify as well. As they do, we commit to providing swift relief, even as we consider the uncertainty of the environment going forward. While there is still much to understand, we can be very clear with you today that we are committed to ensuring that any financial imbalances, which arise from this situation, are reconciled proactively and addressed fairly and timely for all those we serve. Let me now share a few of the specific actions underway at Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum has cared directly for more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients to-date and is operating more than 400 test sites across the country. We quickly shifted more than 4,000 additional OptumCare physicians to our digital care clinics on our way to more than 10,000 in the weeks to come. These rapid responses was made possible by the swift work of the regulatory agencies, allowing flexibility in state licensure requirements for clinicians across service categories and state lines. We thank and commend them for these actions and encourage long-term continuation of these policies. Our digital health consumer engagement has accelerated in many directions. For example, we\u2019ve applied new COVID-19 clinical pathways for our device based remote monitoring services to identify and prioritize high-risk individuals for follow-up care. Our newly developed COVID-19 symptom checker provides people with recommendations on how to proceed, based on the results. And we\u2019ve provided access to our digital behavioral healthcare services, which give clients on-demand help for stress, anxiety, and depression. All content, coping tools and peer support are free to everyone. Because it\u2019s critical everyone receives their needed medications, we are providing early refills, extended authorizations and increased home delivery options. We also extended hours at our behavioral health pharmacies to ensure medication adherence for those with mental health and substance abuse challenges. The spread of the virus has created a significant health risk for those receiving life-sustaining infusion services traditionally administered in the hospital or hospital clinic settings. For these patients, we\u2019re providing infusion services through our Optum Infusion ambulatory suites and in their homes through our nurse infusion specialists. Finally, Optum is innovating on the frontlines of care delivery, developing screening protocols to identify patients who are likely to need hospitalizations and collaborating with health and care delivery organizations to share this knowledge. UnitedHealthcare is working at full speed as well with partners across the health system to address the current global emergency. For consumers, UnitedHealthcare has made it simple and easy to access care, waiving cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment and eliminating many administrative requirements. Tens of thousands of people have taken advantage of the special enrollment period we opened for those needing coverage for health benefits, and more than 2 million consumers took advantage of our offer to obtain early prescription drug refills to ensure no one experienced gaps in treatment. UnitedHealthcare digital and telehealth services were ready, and as a result, extensively used as a safe simple and free way to connect with care providers, either through a partner or directly with the patients\u2019 own doctor. UnitedHealthcare is paying careful attention to vulnerable members especially in Medicare and Medicaid by expanding access to our personalized digital care platforms, which provide up-to-date information about prevention, coverage and care. People can quickly talk to a nurse, refill and schedule home delivery for prescriptions and get access to emotional support 24 hours a day. We are also helping federal, state and local authorities address system capacity shortages by supporting them with the main operating experience. One example involves two UHC Community and State leaders, Dr. Jeffrey Brenner and Kathleen Stillo, who are now working exclusively with the State of New Jersey, for the next several months to establish a critically needed field-based hospital system. These are just a few examples of how the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare have mobilized to respond to this public health challenge. There are many more and they are happening every day. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to John Rex, our Chief Financial Officer.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dave. I know you\u2019ve had an opportunity to look through our first quarter financial results this morning. And as such, given the unique circumstances, I\u2019ll be brief about the quarter. As Dave said, while it feels somewhat uncomfortable to be speaking of the financial aspects of this challenging situation, we know this is what you need to understand for your work. Given the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak and its progression in United States, the first quarter financial impact was limited. As you know, incidence rates in the U.S. only started moving meaningfully in mid-March. And elective care trends did not begin to be meaningfully impacted until later in the month. At the segment level, UnitedHealthcare and the OptumHealth, Insight, and Rx businesses all reported first quarter operating earnings that were in line with our own expectations going into the year. Looking ahead, we are maintaining our full-year 2020 earnings per share outlook. As I\u2019m sure you would expect this view is subject to a number of key considerations that yet to play fully out, including the full incidents and intensity levels we experience, the duration and ultimate impact on economic, employment, and business activity levels, and the duration and extent of disrupted care patterns as the virus runs its course. Beyond our maintained earnings per share outlook, we anticipate other key Investor Conference metrics likely will play out differently than we expected at that time. And our quarterly progression will likely vary from historical patterns. For example, the environment today suggests the second quarter could be the lowest medical care ratio of the year, potentially, meaningfully so with elective care demand still restrained. Offsetting this impact, we would anticipate the second half medical care ratio could be meaningfully elevated. Among some of the factors we consider, people will hopefully have more comprehensive care access by the second half of the year. And some of the currently deferred care can be restored. Individuals with chronic conditions are among those for whom we have considerable concern in this environment. While we are mitigating the impact through other means, mistreatments can aggravate health status, resulting in initially more intensive care needs as the system reopens. We will proactively work to help them quickly seek care and the impact of testing and coverage expansion such as serologic tests. These are just a few of the factors we must consider, and I\u2019m confident you are eager to probe into all of these areas and likely more. We appreciate your understanding of our need to defer on providing point estimates and even ranges today, given the evolving situation, the multi-variables at play and their interdependencies and our regard for the mini thoughtful views that will shape the situation. Our strong financial position and liquidity enable us to fully meet both of our operational and strategic needs. We ended the quarter with an intentionally higher excess cash balance and a higher than normal debt-to-capital ratio. This was a prudent response to what we saw in more volatile financial markets during the month of March. When considering our quarter ending excess corporate cash position, we size our debt to total capital ratio at about 40.5%. As markets become more normal, we will return to our previous cash management and leverage position. Given our critical relationship with our healthcare delivery partners, we moved quickly to implement policies to provide enhanced liquidity for care providers, by accelerating nearly $2 billion in payments, provided needed support to health systems and individual care providers. These types of actions are important to help provide more financial stability for the system. We expect some metrics such as days in medical claims payable and cash flow will be impacted as a result of these actions. Well, that will be transitory as we move through this situation together. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, John. I hope this gives you some insight into what we are seeing and the actions we are taking to serve people, communities and the health system during these unprecedented times. We are committed to applying the full capacity of our enterprise to serve, not just our patients, members, and customers, but also the hundreds of millions of people impacted across the nation and around the world. We will continue to protect our team members and their families, apply our skills, energy and broad capabilities to serve and aid others in this time of crisis. Our mission is to help people live healthier lives and to make the health system work better for everyone. This moment of challenge is proof of the resolve of the 325,000 women and men of UnitedHealth Group to achieve this mission, and you can also expect us to be fully prepared to excel on the other side of COVID-19, ready to respond to demand for health system resources and adapt our strategic priorities to emerging opportunities to lead in the development of the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. Let\u2019s open it up to questions please. One per person, so we can get to as many as possible. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if we could get the quarter end IBNR before the quarter. And if you could just comment on OptumHealth\u2019s performance from 2007 to 2011? And how the business is different today in terms of more risk-based business? You've added some fee for service businesses. But how you'd expect the performance of OptumHealth to track versus how it performed back in the financial crisis? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Gary, could you \u2013 can you clarify the first part of your question please?\nGary Taylor: Yes. I\u2019m just hoping within the medical claims payable number you could give us the IBNR number that typically shows up in the Q?\nDavid Wichmann: Do you want the dollar estimate?\nGary Taylor: The dollar amount. Yes.\nJohn Rex: So Gary, this is John Rex here. We get our Q up very, very quickly and we'll have that for you. And you can follow-up with Brett also if you need any color on that particular metric.\nDavid Wichmann: And so, as for \u2013 I think you can see that our days payable are consistent with quarter end last quarter and then also slightly elevated year-over-year as well. So I think you can take something from that. And then also just generally speaking, what's gone on with development in terms of the continued conservative posture of the business and how it records its year \u2013 quarter end, year end and other IBNR estimates. Just also rely on the fact that it's [inconsistently] [ph] applied to the best of our ability as always and then formed not just by claim lags, but other things as well. So on OptumHealth I might suggest that rather than responding directly to your question, I just suggest it is right on our expectations. I know there's some commentary about it this morning, but it was definitely on our expectations. What people, I don't think realize about this business is that the elective and chronic disease management deferrals work both ways in a business that has two-thirds of its business, our revenues are risk-based and third of them are fee for service space. So you might want to think about that as you think about the performance expectations of this business going forward. I just want you to know I'm very proud of this team and how they've served and how they've adapted. And if I can, I'd ask Wyatt Decker to provide you with a few examples of how the team has performed.\nWyatt Decker: Thank you, David and thank you Gary for the question. Yes, to characterize the response to COVID-19 of Optum and OptumHealth, I would use four adjectives, courage, compassion, collaboration and a can do spirit. The over 65,000 doctors, nurses and advanced practitioners and others of this team had been on the front lines of the COVID response as you heard earlier from Dave and has stood up over 436 testing centers. We have dramatically scaled our ability to care for patients digitally, including through telehealth vehicles, and will by the end of this month have over 10,000 providers on telehealth platforms and solutions. We have been proud to be also on the front lines of innovation, collaborating with R&D on a whole host of solutions. And just as an example in New York and New Jersey, we have over 329 care sites including 49 urgent care centers and stood up the first drive through testing solution for the state of New Jersey and continued to work very closely with those States and the cities within them to respond effectively to COVID. So much more to come, we anticipate to emerge on the other side of this, a even more sophisticated digitally enabled national provider of health care that is focused on serving our patients and delivering value-based healthcare. Thank you, Dave.\nDavid Wichmann: So that was Dr. Wyatt Decker. I think most of you know Dr. Decker well enough by now having been with us for a while. But just as a reminder, he was the CEO of Mayo, Scottsdale, which is obviously one of their strongest flagship locations. He is also an emergency room physician, which clearly showed through in this crisis or showing through in this crisis, he is intensely calm right in the middle of the crisis. And if you think about the numbers and things they've had to deal with let's just say it's been an honor and privilege to have him here with us today. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First I wanted to dig into early trends on commercial membership. We'd love to hear what you're seeing in the commercial risk, both for instance, in terms of premium collections in April through mid month, right? How much have you collected in April, given all the uncertainty here versus a typical collection? And how many of your members you think have been furloughed? We're just trying to understand the impact of furlough versus unemployment. And then I know there is a lot of uncertainty out there, but if you go into commercial renewals that have to be priced for 7-1 and have to set Medicare bids in the next four to six weeks; a lot of questions on how you're going to bid or set price relative to the potential for deferred utilization coming back next year, possibility of a COVID return during flu season et cetera. So, any color you can give us on pricing as well will be really helpful. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay, Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. So, on a premium relief, we're working with our customers on a daily basis to find the right solutions to ensure their employees can continue to have access to the care they need. I'll give you a little bit of numerical context. In a typical month, we extend grace periods or offer payment plans to customers. That represent about 0.4% of our premium base. For March one premiums, we collected most of the premiums prior to the COVID impact really kicking in. And these extensions increased to about 1% of our premium base. So for April 1 premium so far, the amount of extensions have grown to about 3% of our premium base. So, a little bit elevated, but we're going to continue to work with our customers on payment plans to give them the options for coverage that they need. Let me switch to your second question. You talked a little bit about commercial pricing. Of course, we're in the process of developing our pricing for 2021. We're closely monitoring the emerging COVID-19 information and including things like the claim experience from our members who have been diagnosed with the disease, as well as the abatement of other procedures. We're going to continue our commitment to pricing to our forward-look of costs, including estimates of things like significantly increased testing costs as well as hopefully the cost of the vaccine. Our view of the 2021 costs will continue to evolve as we learn more about the virus. The majority of our member [months] [ph] they should note are really priced after September. So, we'll have time to get a better view on what the 2021 environment will look like.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes. And if it's okay, Dirk, the one of the more immediate needs as well as what we're doing on pricing for Medicare. So, Tim, do you want to take it?\nTim Noel: Good morning, Justin. Thanks for the question. As you know, some of the key inputs to the 2021 Medicare Advantage bid process were published by CMS only last week. So, really early in the process and we never harden our position at this stage. In 2021, as always, we strive to provide consistency and benefits for the members that we serve. We have a long track record of stable-to-improving benefits and have accomplished this in some challenging circumstances in the past. The HIT dynamics that played out over years are an example. So, too early to talk in detail about our benefits and some of the assumptions there. But our clear goal is stability. Stability is always extremely important to our members and it's especially important at a time like this.\nDavid Wichmann: Good, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. Hope everyone is staying safe. So just a follow-up further around the commercial enrollment trends. And I guess I'm curious for 1Q 2020, curious how that membership shook out relative to your own expectations. I think there wasn't any impact yet related to the rise in unemployment in late March in those 1Q numbers. And how are you thinking about unemployment impact that overall membership for the overall company as the year progresses? I know you claimed that you may recapture or gain some members in the Medicaid book as well. Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Dirk, you want to take that?\nDirk McMahon: Yes. So, thanks for the question. As I said in January, we were expecting to be down for both fully insured and self-funded membership in the first quarter. But we expected to gain that membership in both areas as we paced through the year. With the current COVID crisis, we expect to be down for the year as business is closed and employers reduced payroll associated in driving group attrition. At this early stage, I can't tell you what that will be. Again, I will say we'll continue with our pricing discipline and remain focused on delivering the unique value proposition for both our customers and consumers. We do expect to see, as you noted, increases in Medicaid and our individual products to ultimately offset some of the losses we experienced in the commercial group business.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Just one quick confirmation question. Just on that $2 billion of accelerated payments to care providers, that's certainly commendable and very much appreciated on the receiving end. Just from an accounting standpoint, does that have any impact on the reported MLR of 81% in 1Q? Or does the timing, that change in your P&L from a cost recognition perspective around?\nJohn Rex: Hi, this John Rex here. No, it didn't have any impact on that.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Just wanted to make sure.\nDavid Wichmann: It could affect our cash flows in the Q2. That maybe the way to think about it. Next question please. Thank you, Steven.\nOperator: And next is A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. And I'll also echo about everyone staying safe. John, you mentioned in your comments about the slowdown in some re-contracting RFPs. And that makes sense that people can have face-to-face meetings when they're considering big deals. I assume that, that would impact potentially group sales on the insurance side, the OptumRx selling season and the OptumInsight selling. Can you just maybe flesh out a little bit more of how big an impact that is? What you're seeing in those different businesses with respect to large sale activity?\nDavid Wichmann: So, A.J., it's Dave. [Indiscernible]. So, yes, just as this hit, there was a lot of activity in the commercial markets, let's call it, where folks were trying to get their employees to safe place, work at home, and to kind of reestablish our operations as you would expect. It isn't as if everything dried up, but it did slow down a lot. And at least as it relates to the commercial markets, I would expect that, that will come back online here as we get to the other side of COVID-19 or at least for a period of time. Where I think the other place I'd like you to have commentary on would be with Andrew Witty, if Andrew might want to talk a little bit about the impact of the COVID-19 on the appetite for health systems and health plans and others, I mean what their availability has been for business as well.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Thanks very much Dave. And A.J., thanks for the question. As Dave said, it's very interesting situation. I would say pipeline opportunities for Rx and for OptumInsight, very strong. The timings of meetings obviously disrupted by the COVID crisis, as Dave just referred to. Our focus really just now on the OptumInsight portfolio and pipeline, we're actually seeing significant engagement and interest, I'd say actually a step-up in terms of general interest for innovation of how to start thinking through to improve healthcare delivery, how to try and improve their economics as different players in the system become under pressure. We've seen particularly more and more interest in the John Muir type deal that we announced last year, the more comprehensive engaged system. So, timing is unpredictable. We just don't know. But in terms of appropriateness of our offering, well, the needs that we're hearing our clients and customers express, feel very good about that. And I would also say the team led by Robert Musslewhite at OptumInsight are working super hard in terms of innovating our offerings in response to the some of the new needs that are being expressed by our clients at this time. So I would say overall, feels like a continued meaningful opportunities for OptumInsight, timing unpredictable and we have to wait for a little bit more time to go by before we can be certain of when some of these things get closed.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, A.J. So my view is that we'll see a strong demand for Optum\u2019s value proposition, once we get to the other side of this situation. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I appreciate the commentary about the seasonality in MLR, lower in Q2 and then higher in the back half of the year. Do you guys have any just general thoughts and framework about, whenever things do get back to normal, I know that's still a moving target, but how much of what is deferred actually comes back when you see disruptions like this and how long does it take for that deferred volume to actually come back into the system?\nDavid Wichmann: You know, it'd be very difficult for us to project that at this stage, given all the uncertainties that are out there. Kevin, it's a really great question. It's something that we're going to monitor closely and I think by the time we get to the second quarter call, we would probably have a better view of all that. John, do you have anything you want to add?\nJohn Rex: I would just add that, this situation is just so different than anything we've seen before, when we look back at prior situations, when you've seen a cessation in demand, it's a different event. It's a hurricane, it's some other event where the system shuts down and when the system opens up, that demand comes back quite quickly actually as long as everything's up and operating. But this is one of the times where we just haven't been through it before either. So in terms of us trying to step out and understand, both when systems are up open and operating, when comfort levels are there to reengage with systems are elements that we certainly haven't experienced yet. And so I wouldn't want to step out and kind of predict the past that the past events that we've seen when something like this has occurred are predictive at all of that.\nDavid Wichmann: So, it'll have a lot to do with whether it comes back in the fall, what the timeframes are wearing off, whether the elective procedures come back online at what pace, there are just so many unknowns right now, Kevin. So I wish we could answer your question more fully and we hope to be able to provide you guys more guidance going forward. Next question please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. Just want to, first one was a clarification, when you're saying guidance is unchanged despite the moving parts and the metrics moving, is that just at this point you view the COVID impacts to be offsetting? Or is this just simply we're going to wait to change anything overall? And then my real question is just on the physician groups, you talked about two-thirds of the payments being capitated, so obviously that's a huge help from a liquidity perspective to the providers, but did that two-thirds of the total dollars of the OptumCare physicians or you talking about just two-thirds of the dollars from United HealthCare to the OptumCare providers?\nDavid Wichmann: Its cost the entire business, Josh.\nJohn Rex: And Josh, its John Rex, two-thirds of OptumHealth revenues are with our premium revenues, capitated revenues.\nJosh Raskin: Okay.\nDavid Wichmann: So obviously there's deferrals of services, their utilization is lower against their capitated base as an example. So as it relates to the guidance going forward, based upon what we see at this stage, we're maintaining that guidance is really not a whole lot more to be said about it, but I think John articulated well, which suggest that the elective deferrals today are offsetting COVID-19 costs. And what we are committed to today is to the extent that, that drives any imbalances in terms of performance or economics across the system. We're committed to rectifying those as swiftly as possible. Obviously we have to be thoughtful about how we go about that. But that's one of the commitments that we're making today.\nJohn Rex: Josh, clearly we have a number of surveillance tools that we use and kind of both the data and the direct communication. We have members, patients, our clinical workers, and all these are going to continue to inform our response and our forward planning.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you, Josh. Next question please.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify and understand the commentary around sort of that what you just said in terms of ensuring financial imbalances are reconciled. Does that mean potentially rebating back this year beyond any MLR triggered or just hoping to understand the context a bit more there? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, it could be. So there's a number of things to take into consideration, there is challenges with health system funding and liquidity at the beginning, so we put $2 billion to work. There was clearly homelessness and insecurity issues evolving, so we put a fair amount of dollars to that. There was a shortage of PPE broadly across the country, including with our own care delivery capacity and we were remained resolved and committed to making sure that not only our health workforce, but the health workforce broadly stays protected. So not only did we source PPE, but we\u2019re also focused on generating new and innovative testing capacities that would resolve PPE use as well as keep broadly the health workforce safe across the globe. So those are all good examples of what I'll characterize as imbalances that occurred throughout and obviously there's the possibility of financial imbalances to occur as well. And, so as we think about those, employers are having furlough employees, they have no revenues today, they need and want to keep people in coverage. And it very well could be that in under the circumstances, deferrals of services outweigh COVID-19 costs, in those situations not only would there be normal MLR rebate situations, but we very may well find ourselves in a position where we can provide some additional premium relief to those clients. It remains to be seeing whether or not we are able to do so and to what extent, but it is something that we're deeply committed to doing. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. My question is just thinking about the individual business and your current footprint there and if we assume that the economic impacts persist for a period of time and that impacts commercial group enrollment, just interested in your thinking about potential appetite for reentering the ACA exchange markets, that you had exited. And I guess just given the timing of when you need to submit those filings, I would assume that's probably the decision that, even though there's a lot of uncertainty right now, you guys are probably going to have to start thinking about right now. And just interested in how your thought process is right now on that?\nDavid Wichmann: Well, what you can count on is, it will make no staff reactions to this situation in terms of making strategic decisions about Group going into markets. But we have given this considerable thought leading up to the crisis and through it all. Dirk, would you want to comment?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, sure. Thanks Dave. Yes, we began to look at participating in more exchanges prior to the COVID-19 crisis. And so we're still in the process of going through market-by-market, evaluating the relative efficiency of our network, our ability to compete and states where we would like to extend Medicaid. You asked me that we\u2019ll have a more hardened view of our individual exchange intentions on the second quarter earnings call.\nDavid Wichmann: Okay. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, one follow-up question and a real question. So first of all, understood obviously that it's very difficult to predict now the, when procedures are going to come back. But when you think about the capacity of the system to catch up on elective procedures, if we're going to see things coming back into fall or this is just kind of a 2Q phenomenon, how much capacity is there, to catch up by end of year versus what might spill over to second quarter? And, the follow-up question was on the pricing, your membership guidance provided in the 4Q assume some level of midyear renewals. So any color about pricing from midyear in light of all the puts and takes off the situation?\nDavid Wichmann: Yes, I'll give the second question to Dirk. The first, we just don't know exactly when elective deferrals will come online and what the overall capacities are, broadly for them to come online given the circumstances, I think you just think about the evolution of this disease, how fast it came on in the United States, which is where 95% of our revenues are across our company. But think about the evolution of that and then think about the tail and then the possibility of it coming back or not. And the timing of the vaccine and the number of other things that need to be taken into consideration that they just create an uncertain future to get specific around things, our ability to respond to questions like you just asked. So I apologize that we can't, but it's just very difficult for us to give you the responses to those kinds of details. Dirk, you want to talk about mid-years?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, well, like I said, to begin with, the majority of our member months to start off with were \u2013 pricing for the majority of our member months, for 2021 we are going to be priced after September. So we'll have a little bit better view. Now, many of the midyear renewals are sort of going out the door. So that's sort of the scenario we're in.\nDavid Wichmann: And let's say, as it relates to our care delivery practices, we've been evolving the ways in which we provide care and ensuring that our chronic members who have also deferred treatment, that they have the option to get treatment through these telehealth capacities, the way in which we're working on OptumRx to make sure that they are compliant with their pharmacy solutions and the way in which general pharmacies are available and community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers to ensure that those patients who have high needs are attended to as well. So there's evolutions that are going on underneath, what's happened here to make sure that we're opening up capacities in new and different ways. And then the only other thing I would say is that when we get to the other side of COVID-19, our operations are all standing ready to respond to the demands that might be there. So our ambulatory surgical care centers will be available immediately to respond to the demands, the pent up demands that will exist for joint replacements and the number of other things that they do so well. So part of what we're doing is, making sure that when we get to the other side, we're ready. And not only ready to respond to the immediate demands, but also we're ready to adjust and evolve our business strategies to respond to the things that we've learned through this crisis. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: And next is Charles Rhyee with Cowen, please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. So I know you guys have been hesitant to put hard numbers around how you expect elected procedures to sort of rebound back, particularly in the back half of this year, but Johnson & Johnson on its earnings calling yesterday noted that, there was a slide on the presentation like the procedure volumes to be down about 55% to 80%, in second quarter, but third quarter also down about 40%, with the rebound really above baseline coming in 4Q of around 15%. This seems sort of more conservative in terms of a rebound than you\u2019re kind of noting. Maybe can you kind of give us some of your thoughts on what\u2019s behind your assumptions? And \u2013 or is your thoughts on how they\u2019re looking at the situation perhaps? And then, John, I know you said that this is not like other situations; obviously, in natural disasters, things bounce back fairly quickly because the demand hasn\u2019t really gone away. Is may be looking at something like the financial crisis a better proxy then or how we might think about elective procedures kind of coming back? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Hey, thanks, Charles. So a couple of thoughts, and then I won\u2019t opine on anyone else\u2019s, any other company\u2019s comments they put out there. But let me just kind of try to give you a few of our comments. I think one of the very important things to keep in mind in this extremely different situation are the co-dependencies and the interplays across a business like us, in terms of all the things you\u2019re describing. And so, when we talk about, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know right now and we\u2019re actually not going to try to make calls to some of those. Keep in mind that there are factors that move differently in a diverse enterprise like this. Intensity levels, durations of the virus impact also the duration and intensity of the deferral of elective procedures. So, there are factors in there as you go across the range of options that we consider the multi-variable factors that we look at when considering our outlook that interplay. And so, that informs kind of how we think about \u2013 how we just think about trying to consider different way that things would play out. And certainly, Dave did mention that, yes, and I mentioned also that we did \u2013 we have seen declines in procedural volumes and we saw those starting kind of late in March and those continued into April. But trying to use some of these other examples, even as you mentioned, the financial crisis as a measure, from our perspective aren\u2019t necessarily still measures that we think are all that instructive because we haven\u2019t seen a cessation in activity before like this. And the reasons for this cessation in activity are very, very different and the duration of those also is quite different. So, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d even go to that one as kind of \u2013 as the instructive measure for us.\nCharles Rhyee: Great. Thank you, John.\nDavid Wichmann: Next question please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wondered, my question\u2019s on capital deployment. I wondered if you might comment on how the crisis is impacting your thinking around that with maybe two opposing specific thoughts, one being your comments around conservation of liquidity at the corporate level, but then also the thought around say larger health systems being more capable of responding to a crisis like this and the strain on some providers perhaps presenting some consolidation opportunities? So, wondering if you might comment on capital deployment.\nDavid Wichmann: John.\nJohn Rex: Sure. So, I think our long-term capital deployment strategies remain. Our long-term capital deployment strategy is absolutely in terms of how we think about allocation of capital into our businesses, into new organic growth opportunities, M&A opportunities, and as we think about things like dividend and share repurchase also. And clearly, you saw, we responded, we are in the fortunate position of being able to respond to what we saw as some instability in the financial markets in March, by increasing our cash position in order to fortify that, and in part and kind of given the role that we play in being reliable partners for the broad health care delivery community. And so, that part being important, you can be sure that as we think about things in kind of the very near term, we\u2019re respectful of markets, that is financial markets and how they\u2019re behaving, and we\u2019ll continue to be respectful of those and understand kind of that they are functioning and functioning fluidly as we consider those elements. And that may impact the timing of how we think about different capital allocation activities. We\u2019re going to be super respectful of that because of the important role that we play in the health system and our obligations to be \u2013 provide health security for the people we serve and to be ready, enable and reliable partners for the health care delivery community broadly.\nDave Windley: Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you. My comments would be that is exceptionally well capitalized company. It\u2019s been maintained with the capital structure, been maintained very consistently with high integrity. And I think it\u2019s one of the strengths of an organization going into the situation to have the capital structure that we have today and the financial backing broadly. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, good morning. I appreciate all that you guys are doing. I thought it was a great job outlining the number of things that you are contributing to the system. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions, really more OptumHealth OptumCare related. And it\u2019s just one variant of the same question. For right now, could you describe how you\u2019re standing up telehealth enablement and virtual care delivery within the services? And then before you get to the kind of post-COVID, as you\u2019re thinking about that transition period as you\u2019re ramping back \u2013 as the economy is ramping back into service, have you guys come up with perhaps how you will scale back? Meaning, are you going to be doing temperatures, masks for patients, things like that to try to get a sense of how quickly you can start to ramp back in the ASC business and some of the other physician businesses?\nDavid Wichmann: Great. Thank you, Lance and appreciate your comments about the company\u2019s performance during this timeframe. Dr. Wyatt Decker?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thank you, Lance, for your question. And on the digital health and telemedicine side, we have both our internal capabilities, which we\u2019re leveraging extensively including telepsychiatry, that\u2019s the nation\u2019s largest telepsychiatry platform. We\u2019re also working with partners, collaborators and vendors and have over half a dozen national partners who are assisting us to stand up solutions quickly. I would also add that we believe that telemedicine is not all created equal and we\u2019re very focused on keeping the personal and intimate nature of healthcare alive and well. One of the ways we\u2019re doing that is by making sure whatever possible that our OptumCare patients can reach out to their already established provider using telemedicine, which is a very different experience than a random or unknown provider, as an example. So, we\u2019ll continue to leverage this. We\u2019re also leveraging the Internet of Things, caring for people in their home and AI-enabled symptom checkers as other examples of how we\u2019re really dramatically accelerating our digital health solutions. And then to your second part of your question around the other side of this and how do we adapt? Obviously, that\u2019s something that is evolving. We will, of course, work and have been working hand-in-glove with local, state and federal recommendations and authorities on when is it safe to resume elective and scheduled care and procedures. We will also, as Dave mentioned, are taking great care of our health care workforce, so that they are able to resume activities really quickly, which we expect to be a differentiator. And then the final thing I\u2019d say is that when you look at OptumHealth, one of the remarkable things is what a resilient and diversified health care business it is. So, we\u2019re in 43 states. We have ambulatory care surgical centers, we have primary care, we have specialty care and because the COVID epidemic and pandemic is playing out differently across the United States, we feel we\u2019re really well positioned and have been able to keep our workforce busy, contributing to the communities they serve, while we adapt to this changing environment. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann: And one of the things we did was, as part of all, is we created a \u2013 leveraging that swabbing testing capability, so it allows for self-administration in a clinical setting. We also, alongside that developed a new test \u2013 set of testing protocols, procedures and applied technologies for the health workforce. And part of it was to ensure that that workforce is safe to apply their services, but also that we were able to ensure that they were as fully available as possible, which I know is on the top of mind for each and every one of them. So that technology, those protocols, that process that was developed, likely find its way not only into a clinical setting but also could find its way into other essential business settings as well, as a normal course of business going forward. So, we could see applying those types of concepts across OptumCare but frankly across the industry. We have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you. You\u2019ve had a lot of success with engaging physicians to taking risk. And I\u2019m just curious how do you think this long-term impact of the pandemic will affect the interest from physicians in participating in the risk model? Thanks.\nDavid Wichmann: I think as it relates to this one, at least so far, they probably have performed just fine. Obviously, it will remind a number of them about how important it is to align with certain partners that have a strong financial standing. And I would characterize UnitedHealth Group, in particular, Optum and OptumCare as being those kinds of entities. So, I hope what they do is they seek a greater sense of alignment towards, with partners or choose their partners based upon the strength of them in multiple different dimensions. And I think Wyatt has done a great job of building that business in a multi-dimensional way with a great number of strength. So, hopefully we\u2019ll see greater alignment to UnitedHealth Group.\nDavid Wichmann: Thank you for your questions and thank you all for your time and your questions today. As we\u2019ve shared with you, we\u2019re going to continue to apply the full breadth of our resources, technologies, innovations, and compassion to support our members, our patients, provider partners, our team and the broader health system as we see our way through this global health crisis together. Please be safe each and every one of you and thank you for your time today.\nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."}], "2022": [{"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-01-15 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the Company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 19, 2022, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the Company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare for delivering strong results throughout 2021 and creating the momentum that is carrying us through as we enter into this year. For example, performance in two key elements of our growth strategy, accelerating the transition of patients to Optum-led value-based care and strong United Healthcare growth in serving Medicare Advantage consumers are both tracking well with the expectations we shared with you at our recent investor conference. These, and the broader performance across the enterprise, confirm our comfort in our ability to advance our stated growth strategies and to support our long-term 13% to 16% EPS growth rate. When you look back at the prevailing themes for 2021, you see a story of accelerating growth, strong collaboration between Optum and UnitedHealthcare and with our many external partners helped us grow in serving both commercial and government markets, unlock new innovation, introduce integrated products and services to the marketplace and significantly increase the number of people benefiting from value-based models of care. Last year, we leveraged our technology capabilities to help physician and hospital systems better serve their patients and communities. And we sharpened our focus on the consumer working to elevate and improve the end-to-end experience. Taken together, these efforts helped us add more than $30 billion in revenue for the year, about $10 billion above our initial outlook. And you should expect similar growth in the year ahead. We see an even greater demand for integration to bring together the fragmented pieces of the health system, to harness the tremendous innovation occurring in the marketplace, to help better align the incentives for providers, payers and consumers and to organize the system around value. A healthcare system that is more connected, more informed, more human and more responsive to every person's unique needs. At our investor conference, we shared five key areas for growth and for differentiated experiences across our portfolio. These growth opportunities will guide our strategy this year and for many years to come. First is care delivery. More specifically, value-based care. For UnitedHealth Group, this is more than a primary care strategy. It's a comprehensive clinical strategy encompassing our growing behavioral, home, ambulatory and virtual care capabilities. Our second growth area is health benefits, advancing the quality, innovation and consumer appeal of our benefit offerings and bringing our value-based strategy to life. We enter '22 having generated strong consumer growth in Medicare Advantage and saw further progress in Medicaid and growing momentum in our commercial business. Next, health technology. Our major partnerships across the country help health systems improve their performance and returns, all to better support their missions. We're energized by the potential to bring these comprehensive tailored solutions to a greater number of system partners in 2022 and beyond. Fourth, health financial services, vastly improved in the health payment sector, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers and consumers while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience. And finally, pharmacy services, where people interact most often with the health care system. We can better use the significant breadth, volume and value of our foundational pharmacy services and data capabilities and integrate our medical pharmacy and behavioral capabilities. All of this to provide whole person care, support the discovery of new drugs and treatments and support value-based models of care. In sum, we enter 2022 with heightened confidence in our ability to execute upon the objectives we set forth in late November. And with that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. I thought I would take a few minutes providing you with some additional details on our first growth priority, value-based care, how we have prepared for it, the investments we have made and how we see it working in the near future. This has been something we have been working on and building over the course of a decade. For example, there was significant operational groundwork and investment that went into supporting the 0.5 million new patients for whom OptumHealth will become accountable in 2022. Successful execution requires a lot of detailed planning, investing and building. It has become a distinctive competency of our enterprise, which we can now increasingly apply at scale. So what does it take to prepare for moving to a fully accountable arrangement? Investments can be significant. As an example, in '21, we incurred over $100 million in preparation expense. Within this, there are three major work streams involved: Clinical training and staff preparation, technology and data enhancement, and third is network coordination. The first work stream focuses on physician education. It begins well more than a year prior. It's important to provide the resources and knowledge for physicians to begin approaching their patients differently. They engage in their patients\u2019 whole help well ahead of taking on greater accountability. We find it to be an essential and sometimes complex shift in what our long-held fee-for-service practices. Beyond education, we ramp up our capacity in the form of physicians, nurses and other clinicians to meet the requirements of our business. The second area focuses on the technology systems and information needed to support patient care and effective clinical management. This includes things like patient portals and utilization management systems as well as reporting systems for teams to effectively manage. Finally, is the planning and network coordination work to support clinical oversight beyond primary care and ensure true continuity of care. This planning and coordination includes initiatives such as identifying the patients most in need and ensuring a seamless transition to high-touch clinical care services that improve health and quickly pairing patients with a personal care navigator to assist in supporting complex health needs, appointment scheduling and timely medication support on day one. These foundational preparations and investments have been critical in creating strong results across a variety of geographies and practices we have transitioned. We expect this expertise will serve us well as we transition even larger groups of patients in the years to come. Before handing it over to John, I'd like to update you on how COVID has impacted our operations. Like other businesses, we have experienced moderately higher levels of attrition and more unplanned absences. We had prepared for this situation through increased recruiting capacity as well as meaningfully upgraded digital capabilities to improve customer experience and reduce call volumes. As a result, in the first two weeks of '22, traditionally, our most demanding period, we were able to service the needs of our patients and customers. At the same time, we responded swiftly to the federal mandate for cash-free COVID test for consumers, a highly complex undertaking. With four days notice, UnitedHealthcare created a customer digital experience for ease of reimbursement and established a partnership with Walmart and now Rite Aid that eliminates cash outlays by consumers at point of purchase. We expect more partnerships in the days ahead. As we look forward, we believe we have the right capacity in place to execute our business priorities and meet our customers' expectations. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk, and Happy New Year, everyone. I'll start by expanding a bit on Dirk's comments on the COVID impacts we're seeing. In the most recent weeks, inpatient hospitalization levels for our members are similar to the January 2021 levels, even with national COVID case rates about 4x higher. For those people needing inpatient care, severity is seemingly lower as we are seeing shorter lengths of stay compared to that earlier period. At the same time, we are observing familiar correlations of care activity patterns to other periods of elevated infection rates experienced over the past two years. For example, in these early weeks of January, we are seeing slowing in primary care, elective visit and procedural volumes. Activity over the past several weeks shows primary care visits having declined about 10% and an even higher rate of decline in specialist visits. As always, our prime focus is on helping people get the care they need when they need it. Moving now to our specific business performance. OptumHealth's revenue per consumer grew by over 30% in '21, driven by the increasing number of our patients served under value-based arrangements. Consistent with the expectations we shared in late November, we had a strong start to the year and continue to expect to add 500,000 new patients in accountable value-based relationships, benefiting from the groundwork laid over the past many years. OptumInsight earnings grew 25% in '21, with operating margins approaching 28% for the year. We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $22.4 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. Our expanding relationships serving health systems has been a key factor driving this growth, and we expect these partnerships to continue to grow in '22 and beyond. OptumRx earnings grew 6% for the year, driven by the continued expansion of our pharmacy services businesses, supply chain initiatives and strong cost management activity and benefiting from strong customer retention. In addition, we continue to see the impact of OptumRx' movement to a higher value pharmacy care and specialty services orientation. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Full year revenues of $223 billion grew 11%. As noted, our 2022 Medicare Advantage member growth outlook is very positive and consistent with the objectives we established at our November investor conference. Within the up to 800,000 new members we will serve in '22, about 3/4 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. And given the steady strides we've made in quality performance, we have the opportunity to enroll people in our newly rated five-star plans throughout the entirety of this year. Our Medicaid membership outlook for '22 continues to incorporate an expectation that states resume eligibility redeterminations, resulting in modest net attrition. In January, we began serving the citizens of Minnesota and continue to support the Missouri expansion this year as well as renewed relationships with Ohio, Tennessee and Nevada. Over the course of the year, we will look to continue to expand upon the nearly 8 million individuals we serve across 31 states. We concluded '21 with commercial membership, about 200,000 people ahead of the original outlook provided. Creating this momentum is the strong response we are seeing to the new innovative products you have heard us discuss. Products such as Navigate Now, which use the Optum virtual network as a first option. Our capital capacities remain strong. Full year '21 cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion or 1.3x net income, about $2 billion above the initial outlook we shared a year ago. We continue to expect our 2022 cash flow to approach $24 billion, about 1.2x net income. And we ended '21 with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 38%. These ample capital capacities allow us to continue to accelerate our investments, while remaining committed to an advancing shareholder dividend and supporting our expected repurchase of between $5 billion and $6 billion of stock in '22. Our 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook of $21.10 to $21.60 is consistent with the view we offered seven weeks ago. From this distance in contrast to the past two years, we expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience with just under 50% of full year earnings in the first half and the first two quarters comparably even. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Before we transition to the Q&A portion of the call, I hope you've already taken away the strong sense of confidence John, Dirk and I share in the growth potential of this company, rooted in the growing number of people we're serving in value-based models, the depth of relationships we're building with local health systems, our pharmacy capabilities and the innovation and consumer focus that's driving growth across our government programs, individual and commercial businesses. As demand for innovation and integrated solutions, products and services only continues to grow, we've never been in a better position to help bring together the fragmented pieces of health care and create more value for the people we try to serve. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Scott, go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Good morning. Thank you. My question was just a little follow-up just on the Medicare Advantage environment. And if you could just talk about, from your perspective, whether you've seen any material change in the level of competition in the market for 2022 relative to 2021? Then just would also be interested. And for United, whether there's been any types of shifts in the distribution channels through which you're driving your MA growth just as we think about some of the evolving trends in Medicare? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Scott. Listen, thanks so much for the question. Before I hand it over to Tim Noel, who runs that part of our organization, let me just reiterate how pleased we are with the overall performance through the selling cycle. The number of folks who have chosen UnitedHealthcare continues to grow super well ahead of market, growing market share once again. And as we said a couple of times in our opening commentary, very much in line with the expectations that we set out for the year. So really, big picture, super positive. I'll hand over to Tim to give you a little bit more background to all of that, Tim.\nTim Noel: Good. Great. Hey, thanks, Scott, for the question. This is Tim Noel. Yes, the way I see the MA market is it's been highly competitive for a number of years. And I don't see 2022 as a step function increase and that level of competitiveness. The trend of more entrants, better benefits has really been a multiyear one. And we see this trend as being one that's very good for seniors and also one that's very good for the overall growth of the Medicare Advantage industry. Seniors are shopping for more value as they should be. And for our part, we're really focused on differentiating our offerings in the marketplace. And what we're doing is we're driving things, not only around benefits, but also around capabilities. Better digital tools, ease of payment, product innovation, better and more personalized service experiences, better clinical quality, more value-based and aligned care provider relationships are all part of that. And our approach continues to resonate in the marketplace. So, we really like our performance and our positioning inside a very strong and growing marketplace.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And Scott, just your secondary on distribution. I think it's fair to say nothing's changed in terms of our approach to distribution. In fact, I think we've never had more distributors, agents working on our behalf across the country. So, no change there, whatsoever, and we are super grateful for all of the support we get from agents and brokers and others who help us get the message across well to seniors who are looking for MA as an option. So really very positive about that environment. Let's go to next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My question relates to OptumHealth and the disclosures around the top line growth, have been really helpful. But I'm curious more on the margin side, and specifically, how margins trend over time when you take 100% global capitation. And maybe specifically, if you're making money on the totality of that business today and maybe how that migrates over time?\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks so much. Let me pass it over to Dr. Wyatt Decker, who looks after OptumHealth. Wyatt?\nDr. Wyatt Decker: Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. Absolutely, we are positioned, the OptumHealth, as a growth platform. And we're investing in new markets and deeper penetration into established markets. As we do that and expand the capabilities, you'll continue to see us delivering on an 8% to 10% margin range. So you can anticipate us to continue to generate strong performance while investing in what will be a multiyear growth platform. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: John Rex, I think maybe add a little?\nJohn Rex: Sure. And just, Josh, getting at your point of how does that progress over time, and Dirk did offer some nice commentary on the call in terms of the investments that we make as we're looking to move to capitation. And that does tell a kind of a multiyear story of investments as we get ready to move to capitalization. So that's even before any revenue comes into the picture we're making, we're making those investments. And significant -- very significant ahead in a couple of years ahead, especially in the year ahead of those transitions before there's any kind of revenue view. So that is creating kind of that impact. And what Dr. Decker was describing there. So as we seek to do that and those movements occur, we're always bearing within that a fairly significant investment load. This year, it was obviously fairly significant with the 0.5 million members that we transitioned. And we continue to accelerate, those investments continue also, while we start getting leverage on those as we do more of it. So we're kind of bearing that within the 8% to 10% that Wyatt was describing there.\nJosh Raskin: Yes. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Absolutely. I think both sets of comments really point to what's happening, Josh. One way that helps me think this through a little bit is to think about vintages. So every year, there's a different number of folks who transition into the capitated environment. Of course, that number grows every time. So this year will be almost double what we did last year. Last year was almost double what we did the year before. As you think about it, the margin associated or the economics associated with each vintage changes year-by-year as those populations of folks stay in OptumCare for sustained periods of time. So, as you think about the longer-term evolution of the economics of OptumCare, I'd encourage you to think about it reflect on how those vintages are aging into their stabilization within the value-based environment. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate your comments on how trends is kind of starting the year with COVID. Can you give us a view of how you ended the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of five business segments? I remember correctly, commercial was running a little bit hotter than Medicare and Medicaid in the third quarter. And then anything you could tell us in terms of what you think maybe a rough number might be on the cost of the new home testing requirements? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much Justin. I'll ask Brian Thompson, President of UHC to comment in a second. I think overall, those trends we saw segment by segment didn't get too different as we roll through here. I would just say, as we go into the last part of the year, the last couple of weeks as Omicron really started to show its face, that still -- we're still kind of learning exactly what the impact of that. As you can imagine, we can see some things very quickly like physician visits. A little harder to know exactly what kind of complexity of claims might look like in hospitals, that will become clearer the next few weeks. But let me ask Brian to go a little deeper on all of that.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, Andrew. Thanks for the question, Justin. Brian here. As Andrew alluded to, I would say our results for COVID in the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations. As you said, similar to the dialogue we had for the third quarter as well as at the investor conference with commercial largely at baseline performance in both care and caid modestly below, still with that same dynamic of Medicaid being slightly below Medicare. So not much change there. As you suggested, and as we had reiterated in our opening comments, Omicron obviously emerging here in December and I think John Rex said it well. While there's certainly some differences in contagiousness and severity, the impact of abatement following these swells and infections is consistent with what we've seen in Delta and other strains prior, double-digit declines in both physician visits as well as specialist visits. So we're continuing to see that dynamic play out. What we may not have anticipated an increased testing and costs are offset with beneficial unanticipated levels of abatement. So that seems to be holding here in the early stages of Omicron. To your point, with respect to at-home testing, our focus right now is really the consumer experience. As you know, these rules came out just a week ago. Our goal has been how can we ensure that our members know where they can go and get access to those at-home tests without a cash outlay. We've really been pleased with the various retailers that we've been working with, Walmart and Rite Aid, in particular, but many to follow of getting this capability stood up in a matter of four days. We're encouraged by that. And at the same time, creating a really easy digital experience for those that do shop and need reimbursement when they go to UnitedHealthcare and My UHC, they're able to easily understand how to get that reimbursement. That's been our focus. I think isolating the cost of the COVID test from this distance isn't really instructive. I think if and when it remains durable, as a function of not only supply and demand, but how this plays out over the course of the year. And again, I'm comforted by this offsetting dynamic of care deferral that has followed any of these unanticipated waves. Thanks, Justin.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And I also just want to express thanks to the folks at Walmart and Rite Aid and others who will join shortly in helping get this preferred network up so quickly. The fact that we were in a position with our partners to be able to respond to patient need from Saturday, the very first day that this was requested from the federal government, I think, speaks well to the capabilities of the private sector, the participants within the health care sector to respond and solve problems on behalf of the country. And I think that's an example which we see repeated across the landscape, and we're very, very proud of being able to work with Walmart and Rite Aid in this particular case. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. I just want to go back to the MA conversation for a second. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the margins in that business? And whether you think any differently about the appropriate margin or acceptable margin in that business now that you've got an ability to earn additional earnings streams through decapitation, the value-based care arrangements that you have?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Kevin. Let me ask John Rex to reflect on that.\nJohn Rex: Yes, Kevin, it's John here. So yes, when we think about kind of our business structure, we have separate businesses across the Company. And as you know well, extremely important to us is remaining -- is retaining bright lines across those businesses. We serve over 100 payers in OptumCare. We serve many payers across the OptumInsight businesses. And so when we think about our business, they stand alone from a margin perspective, all of our businesses. And that's very important to how we operate the Company, how we serve others and how we approach the marketplace.\nAndrew Witty: Absolutely, John. Thanks so much. And Kevin, thanks for the question. It's also really important to remember that every single one of our service lines, business lines is literally tested and challenged at 24/7, 365 days a year through all of its multi-payer relationships, the competitive environment we're in. I don't think there's really any space where we don't have multiple competitors at some level. that we service, we are constantly being tested in terms of our ability to serve, making sure that we are priced competitively and the like. So I think it's a well-established and highly successful separation between the two businesses, which has performed extremely well. And most importantly, consistently delivers great value to patients, consumers, system partners who we are privileged to work with and increasingly is scoring well in areas like NPS and other measures of consumer experience and service experience.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Wanted to come back to the rapid testing question. I guess, are you guys thinking about this as a definite net cost? Are you thinking the potential offsets from less expensive other testing? And then there does seem to be a push and pull between the supply and the market of rapid test today. And then the Biden Administration distributed 1 billion of these tests for free. I guess, how are you thinking about the supply that your partners are going to have access to as you have these discussions?\nAndrew Witty: Stephen, thanks so much for the question. Yes. As Brian alluded to earlier on, I mean, at this point, a little hard to know exactly, obviously, partly because of the demand and supply dynamic exactly what the kind of scale of the testing program could be. But given you would logically expect that if there was a high sustained demand, there's probably a lot of Omicron or some kind of area in the system that would probably lead to what Brian was talking about earlier with abatement elsewhere in the system. So at this level, I think we kind of expect these two things to somewhat offset. Obviously, we don't know. But at this level, I think it kind of makes sense. The demand and supply, obviously, that has been a challenge across the system historically. We're very fortunate to have very established, experienced supply chain partners in this in the shape already of companies like Walmart, and Rite Aid, and I'm sure they're very much focused on ensuring as much supply as they can get. But I think it's inevitable that we're going to continue to see outages as you go through these geographic kind of surges that we've characterized this pandemic from the get-go. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: So as we think about the MA environment, you're growing above market. Can you talk a little bit about the role that OptumCare plays in the ability to gain share? Maybe if you have any data points that compare the stickiness or attrition among United MA members that are within the OptumCare network.\nAndrew Witty: Ricky, thanks so much. Before I hand that to Brian to maybe reflect on a little bit, one of the things that I think we really are pleased about is the way in which OptumCare has developed a whole set of capabilities to deliver really enhanced focus on MA patients. Obviously, these patients have a high medical need very often. They need high touch. I've been super impressed with the development, not just in the clinic, but also through the at-home programs where we're able to continue to make sure folks are looked after properly. And actually, particularly as we've gone through the pandemic environment, people's preference to have care delivered in the home has become clearer and clearer. But Brian, maybe you could reflect a little more on how that plays through in terms of the attractiveness of what you're able to offer.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. I appreciate that. I think Tim really laid out a long list of things that we focus on to make sure that we remain competitive in this space. And as I think about OptumCare specifically, first and foremost, for us, it's predictability. But beyond that, where we have our best satisfaction, which in turn leads to our best persistency, our members that stay with us the longest is with our OptumCare partners. And I think, first and foremost, that's a benefit for us. I think beyond that, our journey on quality from, as you might remember, just a short decade ago of under 10% to almost nearly 100% was certainly at the support and health from OptumCare, not only in our relationship with them, but how we establish incentives with providers outside of OptumCare. So the list is pretty long. And I would say if I was to point to one differentiation for UnitedHealthcare, it's certainly OptumCare.\nAndrew Witty: Wyatt, would you like to maybe add from your perspective?\nDr. Wyatt Decker: Yes. Well, BT touched on it, but our focus on the consumer and patient experience is relentless. And we are continuing to deploy new capabilities all the time. And Andrew, you mentioned home and community. When you look at the quality of the care that we provide, as Brian mentioned, it's now 99% of UHC members with OptumCare or enforce or higher level plans. And we don't stop there. And so now we have unveiled our virtual care platform that brings behavioral care to the forefront, brings virtual care and physical care and connects people to their own trusted providers. So you'll see us continuing to focus on how do we meet the needs of our members and how do we reduce friction for our patients.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, Wyatt. Thanks so much for the question, Ricky. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Obviously, labor pressures across the health care industry is a big topic. You have involvement in that in OptumHealth as well as in UHC and your discussions with your nonaffiliated providers. I wondered how -- what -- how that's impacting your business, perhaps the shift of people from -- to OptumHealth from UHC maybe a mitigating factor. But any comments about what you're seeing as you try to add your clinicians in OptumHealth? And then also what you're hearing from your provider networks and how that might impact your outlook in UHC?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, A.J. Let me ask Dirk to start that one off.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Thanks, A.J. Look, let me just take this a little bit more broad. As we look across our labor markets, it's a hot market for things like clinical talent, technology and customer service. And one of the things we and Optum did really early in the process is we scaled up our recruiting capacity. We got -- we retained -- we set up attention for some key staff. And one of the other things is we've had pretty decent retention because we have a pretty good mission along those lines. So a lot of additional staffing, a lot of sort of getting ahead of this proactively has been major -- our major action. As it relates to other providers in UnitedHealthcare, we talked about this in the last earnings call. The -- our contracts are negotiated every three years. So it's sort of from our perspective, yes, we're hearing that there are shortages. But we're working with those folks in the shortages, and there's a little bit of inflation, but we ultimately price for that. And like anything else in the market, the market will sell that out. And we're just being very aware of what the implications on a little bit tight labor market are. And hopefully, it will loosen up as we pace forward.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Dirk. And A.J., thanks so much for your question. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatt Borsch: I guess, I was hoping you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the Medicaid redeterminations and what you're expecting in terms of the timing and the impact because I know you touched on modest. I'm just wondering how you're seeing mitigating factors there.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Matt, thanks so much. I'm going to have Tim Spilker, who leads our CNS organization to respond to that. Tim, could I pass over to you?\nTim Spilker: Thank you for the question. At the investor conference, we indicated that we thought states would resume redeterminations in mid-'22. I think based on what we're seeing at this point, that assumption seems even more likely than we thought at that point. Important to note though that we're also working closely with our state customers to better understand the timing and the approach that they will take once they do resume. And probably, most importantly, based on the breadth of UHC's products across commercial coverage, exchange as well as Medicaid, we're confident that we'll pick up our fair share as folks transition from Medicaid to other types of coverage. So thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks. Matt, thank you also. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Just following up on some of the comments on Medicare Advantage. A couple of your peers are talking about changing how they go to market next year, both from a benefit design as well as distribute standpoint. I know it's early to talk about 2023, but I'd just be curious how this informs your approach as you strive to maintain that value differential that your plans provide?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Nathan, for the question. Let me ask Tim Noel to make a couple of comments on that.\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks, Nathan, for the question. As we think about 2023, certainly a little bit too early to get into a lot of depth there given that we haven't even seen an indication of rates from CMS yet. However, when I think about broad strategic goals around distribution and product, I'm not seeing any shift in the stance that we've gone to market with in 2022 and even 2021 and years prior. We are very comfortable with our multichannel distribution approach. And as I indicated earlier, our approach on differentiating our products in a very robust industry continuing to resonate. So, no deviation from what's been a successful formula for us and providing really great value to consumers.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. I think that's exactly it, Tim. And Nathan, the focus on sustained delivery of value is incredibly important, I think, for the underpinning of UnitedHealthcare have done so well in this environment. It's really important from a distribution broker perspective. People understand what we're offering, but it's not volatile. It's even more important after people sign up. People get what they expect. And that is really -- that served us super well. We believe the way in which we put together this benefit package really serves the needs of the members. And it really speaks to why it's so popular. And it's why United, we've been able to grow market share consistently year after year after year. We'll do so again this year. We'll deliver our objectives in MA growth, and we're extremely positive about this part of our performance. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Just wanted to return to OptumHealth for a minute around the fourth quarter. If we look year-to-date, OI was growing 35% almost every quarter. It was up about 17% this quarter. And then I think for next year, you have it growing almost 30%. So was there anything else in the quarter? I know Wyatt talked about some of those incremental investments. I guess it makes sense, a little more of those could have been in the fourth quarter, but anything else on the cost side at OptumCare or anything at the MedSurg or the ASC business to call out impacting 4Q?\nAndrew Witty: I think overall, no, but let me ask Wyatt just to give you a little bit more detail.\nDr. Wyatt Decker: Yes. Thanks, Gary, for the question. And by far, the biggest component that you're referring to is what we've touched on, which is the investment in future growth and the platforms for managing 500,000 new risk lives in '22. We saw some modest uptick in our labor costs that were not really material to our performance, but just because I know that's on people's minds. So as we continue to address that. And you'll see us continue to invest in technologies like our virtual care delivery platform, behavioral health care and home and communities. So it isn't just the risk lives in a senior clinic model. It's this comprehensive care delivery model that has multiple components of investment that will yield fruit, not only in '22, but in following years. So thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Wyatt. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Wanted to talk a little bit about OptumRx. And just wanted to get a sense as to the rate of growth of specialty home delivery and what the margin profile is looking like there. And maybe what the outlook is for specialty generics and biosimilars and the impacts on margin.\nAndrew Witty: Lance, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather Cianfrocco, who looks after OptumRx for us to respond. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Yes. So the -- I would definitely say that the specialty and home delivery business are contributing to earnings and our margin. We've seen growth in specialty from a few things. First of all, it's been rate of capture. Second, we've seen growth with our PBM clients, which of course drives growth when they use our specialty service, as well as we've really been investing in automation. So I'll give you an example of that. Our home delivery and our specialty businesses today are really benefiting from our investment in digital and a better consumer experience. In fact, today, 50% more of our specialty consumers are using our online and digital experience to fill their meds and refill their meds. So we're glad to see that it's resulting in a better consumer experience, but it's also contributing to the earnings of the business. I guess I'd tell you, as I look forward on that business, I think about two things. The first one is continued automation and improvement in experience integrated with the rest of our pharmacies, think about investing with our multi-dose, our investment in regional integrated pharmacies closer to members' homes so that we can get medication to them faster. We're processing and filling over 80% of prescriptions same day today. So, we'll continue to see that cost per script and refill cost per script improve quarter after quarter like we've seen over the last quarter. But to your point, I think the other really exciting part about our specialty business is that in '22, we're going to see a robust pipeline of generic specialty coming to market, mostly in the oncology space. And then we know in '23, we'll see additional opportunities in not just specialty generics, but additional brands in specialty pluses and biosimilar. So together with the automation, the consumer service and the clinical programs that we offer in the specialty business together with just more options affordably to our consumers, we'll continue to see that contribute meaningfully to OptumRx growth and earnings and margin.\nAndrew Witty: Heather, thanks so much. I'll just add to that. I think the work that's going on inside the OptumRx team, particularly around some of the specialty areas as well as the development of our new GPO and readiness for what is likely to be a very interesting period of loss of exclusivity on a lot of very significant pharmaceutical products, some of which are in categories which have really not had competition for many years, I think it sets up the next 24, 36 months, a very interesting period. We're super committed to delivering medicines at the lowest possible net cost to our members and their clients. And it's an area where we expect significant potential as we roll through over the next two or three years. So I think Heather's organization is doing some great foundational work for a next wave of opportunity in the pharmaceutical space. We have time for one last question, operator. So if we could maybe go to the last question.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: So there was so much focus over the past year on the $1.80 EPS headwind for the Company related to COVID in '21. Is the $1.80 essentially where that final number shook out for last year? Was there any deviation in either direction on any key components as we think about the reversal of roughly half of that total headwind in '22?\nAndrew Witty: Steven, thanks so much. Let me ask John to respond to that.\nJohn Rex: Yes, it was materially in that zone of $1.80 is where it fell out. Look, if I would tell you where we thought it was going to be back in November, we said it and the components that would comprise that $1.80 and how they actually fell and they went through all those components. Yes, certainly, a number of them played out a little bit differently than we would have thought back at that period. Perhaps the important learning we got over that period, though, were just the various -- the correlations that we see across the components as those -- as different case rate volumes would occur over the course of the period and such and the impacts on care activity levels and other areas. So definitely, probably didn't step into the year, a year ago, predicting there would be a summer wave actually even. But the correlations held very true over that period. It was the important factor for us. So yes, within that zone of the $1.80 and -- but -- and the components that they played out certainly where it instructed and are instructing how we even think about 2022 and the impacts that we've talked about for that also.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, great. Thanks so much, John. And Steven, thanks very much for that last question. I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to participate in the call this morning, and we certainly appreciate your time and attention. And I hope that what you've heard from John, Dirk and our colleagues on the call today helps you see why we're so confident in our ability to continue to deliver high-quality growth while helping to improve the lives of the people we serve. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you again in April. In the meantime, thanks so much for your attention, and Jennifer, thanks for hosting the call. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-10-14 13:21:06", "content": "Operator: Please standby, we're about to begin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 14, 2021, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the President and Chief Operating Officer for UnitedHealth Group, Dirk McMahon. Please go ahead, sir.\nDirk McMahon: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, our CEO and colleague, Andrew, is not with us this morning since he had an urgent but straightforward procedure last night for a kidney stone. All went very well and we expect him fully back in just a few days. I'm quite confident he's listening now. So I hope you're doing well, boss. John Rex and I will be subbing for Andrew this morning and we have our management team with us, as usual, to help with your questions. We're here today to discuss third-quarter results and the expanding opportunities we see looking ahead. As a result of the progress at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we have increased our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of 1865 to 1890 per share. We continue to prioritize 3 things Andrew has discussed before which are foundational to the growth of our enterprise. First, unlocking the collaborative potential within Optum and UnitedHealthcare for the benefit of all. Second, further developing our technology in data science platform to aid patient care and experience and to help the system run better. Third, strengthening our consumer experience, capabilities, and values. I'll briefly highlight a couple of items for you. You likely have seen the CMS Medicare advantage/quality ratings showing 95% of our UnitedHealthcare members will be in four-star rated plans or better for 2023, up from 78% for 2022 and a new high for our Company. with Optum Care on behalf of the many payers, we serve 99% of Medicare Advantage patients will be enforced our plans or better for 2023. A second important highlight in the quarter, we were encouraged by the ongoing strength in our employer and individual business, which has now grown by over 330,000 people this year with revenue up 7% year-over-year. We continue to see active interest in our product innovations, such as our All Savers level-funded offering and are encouraged by our competitiveness in the market and momentum heading into '22. We also elevated consumer connectivity by incorporating fitness offerings from industry-leading partners. OptumHealth continues to build momentum as well. Entering the open enrollment period for Medicare advantage, we have more than 2.2 million people served under physician-led, fully accountable arrangements, and expect '22 to be another year of record expansion in this key part of our portfolio. Our broad home-based clinical care initiatives at Optum and UnitedHealthcare are central to improving near and longer-term health outcomes for people with medical, behavioral, and social needs. These efforts include Optum at home, which delivers high-quality primary care services in the convenience of the home setting and supports recovery after hospitalizations. Senior served by our home and community offers experienced a 14% lower rate of hospital admissions and about a 4% higher rate of physician encounters. In addition to carrying for people in their homes, we continued to expand capabilities in other optimal sites of care, including via digital means. Optum is distinctively enabling virtual care for patients using their own primary care physicians and behavioral clinicians. For example, a physician engaging in a virtual visit with a patient can easily bring in a behavioral health professional for real-time consultation. UnitedHealthcare is using opt-ins virtual capabilities to introduce a new suite of digital-first products offering a near seamless experience between virtual and traditional primary, specialty, and urgent care. We expect, during 2022 and beyond, to further build on these opportunities to connect and integrate multiple channels of care. Simplify the experience for patients and providers, and deliver quality care that is affordable and in the optimal setting. Let me now go a little deeper in a few areas to give you an assessment of how we were doing on the themes I mentioned at the outset. OptumInsight continues to drive better clinical and operational performance at the health system level. Last week, we reached a new multi-year partnership with a leading and innovative health system, SSM Health, whose 40,000 employees, 33 hospitals and post-acute facilities, and 300 physician clinics, serve the people of Missouri, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Illinois. OptumInsight brings real value in helping the system strengthen and scale essential functions such as care coordination, revenue cycle management, and digital modernization, all to improve health outcomes in patients' care experiences. These and similar efforts to simplify processes, reduce administrative burdens, and help our partners focus more attention on their care, on their core missions of patient care. OptumRx continues to deliver to health system partners such as its new multi-year agreement with 0.32 health, which serves more than 2 million people in New England through its founding organizations, Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, and Tufts Health Plan. OptumRx will provide integrated pharmacy benefit and specialty offerings that will enhance services and deliver improved affordability for their plan members. OptumRx is having a substantial impact through its community behavioral health pharmacies, which now serve nearly 700,000 people with mental health, addiction, and other conditions through more than 600 dispensaries across 47 states. The pharmacies deliver a high-touch approach to care that contributes to a more than 90% medication adherence rate and lower emergency room visits and hospitalizations by 18 and 40% respectively, driving better health outcomes and a lower total cost of care. Within our UnitedHealthcare government businesses, we have increased processing efficiency by 25% over the last year by using Optum technology to improve auto adjudication rates and intelligent work distribution to appropriately skilled channels. We have many such initiatives underway across the enterprise in affordability, provider experience, and product development as we employ advanced technology in data analytics to drive even greater value for the people we serve and the health system. Before turning over the call to John, a quick word on our pending combination with Change Healthcare. We continue to work diligently to satisfy regulatory requests and now believe, based on our experience so far, the transaction should close in the first part of 2022. We are highly energized about the positive impact we can have working together with the exceptional change team. A team aligned with our mission and values and focused on delivering substantial benefits for the healthcare system. These benefits will include helping clinicians by simplifying access to real-time evidence-based guidance as they are serving patients. Closing gaps in care more rapidly to improve health outcomes and lower costs, reducing unnecessary complexity by removing administrative waste and obstruction to make the care process simpler, more cost-effective, and more transparent. And bringing greater convenience, and simplicity to managing consumer health finances while ensuring care providers get paid more quickly and accurately. Optum and Change Healthcare's capabilities fundamentally are complementary in distinct, because both companies already successfully serve health plans and state governments, care providers, and consumers in a highly competitive market. We believe this combination will make the healthcare system work better for everyone and bring exceptional value to those we serve. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. This morning, we reported third quarter and year-to-date revenues of 72 and 214 billion respectively. Growth of 11 and 12% over last year. This growth was led by OptumHealth, primarily our care businesses. In the third quarter, the Optum platform comprised 54% of enterprise operating earnings and continues to show strong growth momentum. Our performance reflects the diverse and complementary strengths of our business, setting the stage for growth in the years ahead. Our updated full-year '21 outlook includes unfavorable COVID impacts consistent with the expectations we have discussed throughout the year. During the third quarter, while direct COVID care and testing costs ran above the expectations we had nearly a year ago, we again saw elective care offsetting the impacts of higher case rates, much like previous cycles in the pandemic. This quarter, there were approximately 60,000 COVID hospitalizations, meaningfully above the second quarter, with the month of August peaking at nearly 30,000 and then declining in September. Looking at specific business performance. OptumHealth's third-quarter revenue and earnings increased 32% and 37%, respectively, year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 30%. This reflects the increasing impact and number of value-based relationships within Optum Care. The expansion of our in-home and community health platform, as well as the growing acuity of the needs we can serve. OptumInsight revenue grew 13% in the quarter, and earnings grew 15%, as the revenue backlog increased by 12% to 22.3 billion. We see overall business development sourcing and activity levels increasing, particularly with care provider customers. And for our software and analytics offerings. OptumRx revenue and scripts grew 6% year-over-year and earnings 5%. OptumRx is seeing both strong customer retention levels and sale success for the largely completed 22 selling season and early activity for 23. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, the third quarter showed increasing member growth in our commercial offerings, particularly in employer-sponsored benefits. Increased employment is a broad underlying contributor, but we are particularly encouraged by the growth we are achieving in our affordable consumer-centric offerings. Medicare advantage membership has grown 745,000 this year. Inclusive of plans which serve dual special needs numbers, we expect to add a total of over 900,000 Medicare advantage members. The number of people served through managed Medicaid grew by more than 1 million members over last year. As we began to serve people in new regions such as North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana, and as state-based redetermination activities remained popped, we were honored to begin serving people in the Missouri Medicaid expansion this month. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with third-quarter cash flows from operations at 7.6 billion or 1.8 times net income. And we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39%. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, this morning, we updated our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.65 to $18.90 per share. Now, with the close of the third quarter, your attention understandably turns to next year. As is our custom, we will offer a few early observations here. While reserving the majority of this conversation for our November 30 Investor Conference, which we hope will be held in person and in New York. Our businesses are both growing and operating well with strong momentum heading into next year. While the pandemic-related impacts remain difficult to predict, given the current trends, we would expect a lower unfavorable COVID impact than experienced in '21. Still, as the dramatic variation of the last 20 months has demonstrated to all, prudent management suggests we should offer an outlook respectful of the fact that the current situation is without precedent. Taking all elements together at this distance, we see current analyst consensus as reasonably beginning to calibrate a '22 outlook. Envisioning that consensus as being towards the upper end of our initial adjusted earnings per share outlook range. With the range being similar to that offered initially for '21. There's still untapped collaborative potential between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to benefit individuals and the system. The power of applied technology to advanced care and service. Improved opportunities in consumer health and experience, and the passion of our people. These and so many other elements lead us to believe our performance expectations for the years ahead remained fully supportive of our long-term 13% to 16% earnings-per-share growth outlook. We look forward to going into more detail on both our view of '22 and the many years of growth beyond at our Investor Conference. With that, Operator, let's open up for questions. One for the caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The floor is now open for questions. At this time, if you have a question or comment, [Operator Instructions]. We ask that you limit yourselves to 1 question. If you ask multiple questions we'll only be answering the first question so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning. So we'll go ahead and take our first caller, Matt Dosch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: All right. Thank you. Squeaky clean quarter. I was hoping maybe you could just talk about how united and to the extent your visibility on others are approaching group commercial, fully insured rate increases for 2022.\nDirk McMahon: Why don't we let Brian time to take that question. Go ahead.\nBrian Thompson: Thanks for the question, Matt. Certainly as we look forward to 2022, the picture is a lot more clear than as we look at the past 20 months. I would say that we feel optimistic not only about our pricing and the rationality of the market, but most importantly the value that we're bringing to customers. So we're optimistic as we look forward.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Let's go to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJoshua Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. My question relates to the value-based care, but more from the UnitedHealthcare side. And so how does UHC think about the use of value-based care providers and maybe some expectations on the movement of membership into fully cap arrangements in 2022. I think you saved 250,000 lives this year, so curious how you're thinking about next year. And then maybe as part of that, what advantages you see of using Optum Care as a partner over some of the others and how you evaluate partners in the markets.\nBrian Thompson: Yeah, appreciate the question. A - Brian Thompson here again. I would say we certainly are encouraged by continuing our advanced care penetration with partners. OptumCare certainly being one of several. When we partner with OptumCare, we see not only our highest satisfaction, but our best benefits and overall performance. And you heard that in our star quality results as well. And we're encouraged not only by what we have done, but also by what's on the horizon.  Historically, you've looked at our combinations largely in a traditional Medicare advantage space, and you're seeing us expand into complex populations and duals. And we're also really encouraged with what we're doing in the commercial marketplace as well. We've got some new offerings coming in that space. So I would say the key takeaway here is breadth and impact. We continue to scale and expand in that space and it's important. We really see this value-based aligned care as a way to drive good value for those that we support and serve.\nWyatt Decker: Thanks, BT and Josh, thanks for the question to A - Wyatt Decker. I would just add that at Optum Health and Care, we are very pleased to be playing a role in reinventing the U.S. healthcare system focused around patients as consumers and value-based care as a major pillar. As you mentioned, we've grown by 250,000 fully capitated lives this year. And we're excited to our partnership with UHC, as well as collaboration partnership with over 90 payers in total to continue to grow our value-based care delivery construct. The other point I'd make is you'll see us increasingly weaving together all of our assets in a comprehensive care delivery paradigm that we feel is unique and differentiated in the marketplace. Thank you.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you for that, BT and Wyatt. Let's go to the next question, Operator, please.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go to the guidance commentary and I guess just clarify, John, is it inclusive or exclusive of the $1.80 headwind from this year? When you talked about reasonable relative to consensus, maybe at the higher end, do you factor in the $1.80? Or can you just provide some guardrails around how you're thinking about that $1.80. Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Hi, Ralph. Good morning. So yes. So as it relates to this year's $1.80, look, our expectation is that will clearly be lower than it was in 2021, as we think about it. We also don't think that will be nothing. I can't imagine we hit January 1 and everything ceases up immediately. So we don't think that will be the case at all. So inclusive of that, when you think about going to that, I think getting inclusive. And as we look at where the where the analyst consensus currently centers, that seems like kind of a reasonable starting point in terms of how we think about -- how we think about that and how we would anticipate and be respectful of the fact that we don't know exactly how this will progress as we move into the new year. Thanks, Ralph.\nDirk McMahon: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Coming back to the topic that Josh touched on in value-based care, but perhaps more Optum Care focused. I'm wondering if you could talk about, one, the providers within the 53,000 that are responsible for the 2.2 million fully capitalized, like how does that interweave? And then secondly, if you could talk about the call it the margin on the global cap revenue. So how capable or how much impact are those providers having on consumption of downstream care such that Optum Care makes a margin on the capitated revenue? Thanks.\nDirk McMahon: Yeah, we'll go to light on that. But let me first start by saying, of course, all of the providers within Optum Care, they are responsible for managing the downstream spend, whether it'd be at specialists, whether it'd be at hospitals. [Indiscernible] And one of the key things that we do within Optum Care is we made investments in our systems to absorb, take, and manage risk. It's just not a paper transfer. It's actually a system where the providers are fully aware of the capitated arrangements and they're managing accordingly. So Wyatt, why don't you add on top of that? You're more on the details.\nWyatt Decker: Yeah. Thanks for the question. And as Dirk mentioned, we focus relentlessly on the quadruple lame, including lowering total cost of care, and providing better outcomes and outstanding patient experiences. And we are relentless in monitoring specific data points that help deliver that out, those outcomes. Specifically, what we see is the members that are in fully capitated arrangements overall have about a 30% lower hospitalization rate and about 40% lower skilled nursing facility occupation rate than their counterparts and fee-for-service, Medicare, as an example. So we'll continue to drive that value proposition.  And as I touched on in the previous question but I'll go a little deeper, as you think about us with our home and community assets increasingly meeting people in their terms, in their homes to deliver components of value-based and primary care, preventive care, and wellness care, and identify early conditions that otherwise might have led to an ER visit or hospitalization. You'll also see us continuing to bring onboard very innovative behavioral health care delivery solutions that are integrated with the primary care providers that again, identify and treat mental health and substance use disorders by identifying them early and treating them in lower acuity settings when that's appropriate. Those are just a couple of examples of how we're creating value for those that we served. Thank you.\nDirk McMahon: Perfect. That's great, Wyatt. Thank you very much for the question. Can we have the next question, Operator, please?\nOperator: Sure. Next, we'll go to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Great. Thanks. I wonder if you could provide just a little bit more color about utilization trends in the quarter and maybe do that by product line, and breaking it out by COVID and non-COVID utilization where you are versus baseline. Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Kevin, this is John. Good morning. Yes. A few perspective on that, as we think about utilizations, trends in the quarter. And I gave some broad indication just in terms of where we were with COVID inpatient stays, and that's for our members. Maybe to give a little kind of further commentary. So as we sit here today, about 5,000 of our members are in an inpatient setting for a COVID-related condition right now. And I'd say versus the peak that we experienced during the quarter. That's probably just a little more than 50% of the peak in that zone, probably a little of that we experienced over the course of the period.  That fell across categories, probably categories, much like you would have observed and the reports coming out nationally in terms of the types of individuals who are in these settings. An average age that was considerably younger than we saw in prior set -- in prior periods for COVID, so similar to what you would have noticed across the board. In terms of broad utilization trends, similar to what we would have described in 2Q where we did describe where, we continue to see commercial members be more active in elective care, and public sector or government program members a little bit less active.  And so kind of similar, just trending at different levels given the prevalence of COVID. It's been interesting over the course of the 20 month. There has been a consistent, fairly rapid reaction when COVID cases go up nationally in terms of the preference of patients to whether or not to seek elective care. That again happen this quarter where it comes in fairly quickly in terms of the hesitation in the system to access, so probably similar along those ranges. Hopefully that provides a little additional color for you on what we're seeing across the full book of business. Thanks for your, Kevin, question. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Next we've got Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First let me just follow up there. John, if you've talked about I think on the previous calls, your guidance assumed about a 101, 102 percent of normal. in the back half of this year. If you could run that by, it sounds like you're saying commercial might have been on a little higher and Medicare, Medicaid a little lower. But if you can give us those numbers specifically, just we have kind of a read through to the rest of the industry, that might be helpful in what you saw in the quarter. And then what do you price, would it be fair that for you to share what you priced for, for next year in terms of trend due to priced to 101, 102% for next year, similar conservatism versus this year? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Justin. So a few other elements on that. Similar broad trends to what we observed in 2Q, just shifting because of the COVID prevalence. Downshifting a bit in terms of elective -- in terms of COVID prevalence but then really fully offset by COVID. That is elective downshifting because of COVID prevalence and then fully offset as we saw, COVID Care become a more important part of the business. That really flowed across the businesses with those trends across the book, like I described, in terms of the general outlook on that. And let me turn to Dirk here to talk about some implications to how we would have anticipated that in our forward pricing.\nDirk McMahon: I mean, Justin, I mean, we of course, are going to always price to our best estimates of forward trend and we're going to take into consideration all the variables that we've talked about. That toggle that John just talked about between COVID, and what we expect with abatement. I don't want to get into the specific details clearly, that's competitive. But at the end of the day, just be aware that we've considered all factors as we priced our forward business within our books. Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yeah. Wanted to ask a little bit about employer growth and was interested in for the third quarter, how much of that was new wins versus in accounts. And then as you're looking at '22 and you're getting visibility on national accounts and middle market. If you can just give a little color on those individual segments and what's driving wins in 2022 in particular? is it product features or is it all savers products, maybe just a little more color on why you're getting wins? Thanks.\nDirk McMahon: Okay. Why don't we send that question to Bill Golden, who will talk about all three of those. Not only the quarter, but also why do you think we're having some success.\nBill Golden: Yes. So thank you for the question. So we're excited about the traction we're seeing in our third quarter enrollment, membership growth for the quarter was really attributed to what I would say a three main components. One is in-group growth was net positive for the quarter. Our wins versus losses, was also positive for the third consecutive quarter, and obviously the preferred one acquisition contributed to overall growth. We're expecting continued commercial growth in 2022 across both our fully-insured and self-funded segments. We're confident in the value story. It is resonating in the market and we're getting good traction with our broad product portfolio. And so products like Bind and Care Cash, and Harmony, and Motion, and All Savers are all contributing to that growth. 1/1/22 for middle market is obviously a little early to predict exactly how all those products will perform in the market, but we're very confident in our ability to continue to perform well in the commercial market for 2022.\nDirk McMahon: And I would just add on to what Bill said. I mean, the new products are important, but one of the fundamental things within the commercial group is clearly affordability. And as we sit back, we have a good program where we manage utilization, we manage medical cost initiatives. We work hard on our network contracts. So a lot of things contribute to success in commercial and some product and a lot affordability. So thanks for your question. Operator. Next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly next, we'll go to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can maybe talk a bit about the labor and staffing environment right now in healthcare and, one, how that's impacting the OptumCare provider business is, whether you're seeing an impact as the vaccine mandates are going into effect as well? But just more broadly as we look at just some of the tightness around labor and staffing in the system. How is that influencing your thoughts in terms of where overall health system capacity is right now? It feels like we're pretty much maxed out right and we sorted just shift between COVID and non - COVID, but seems like the system itself is running pretty much at full capacity right now in terms of just the staffing dynamics. Thanks.\nWyatt Decker: Scott, this is A - Wyatt Decker. Very key question. And as you point out, the U.S. healthcare market is very tight right now. For us in our care delivery assets, we are seeing good both retention, engagement and recruitment of physicians and care providers. A couple of examples like give you, we mentioned at the start of the year, our intend to bring on-board 10,000 additional physicians to our ranks and we've already brought onboard about 8,000 year-to-date. So just as a high level indicator, why, what do we attribute this to?  And I would say in partnership with Patricia Lewis and our Human Capital team, we are relentlessly focused on supporting our front-line care provider teams throughout the pandemic. And they know this, and I haven't been deeply appreciative of it. And we work very hard and this precedes the pandemic, but has yielded dividends during the pandemic to support them in an environment that decreases clerical burden and allows them to focus on the work they love, which is actually taking care of patients, which is what we all want. So overall, we're managing through this. I won't kid you. It's tight and we're keeping a close eye on it throughout all of our operations in our 43 states where we provide care. Thank you.\nBrian Thompson: Yeah. And I would just say as Wyatt said, we're managing through this. From an environmental standpoint, it's not just clinicians, it's in all workers. But one thing I would say is, we had a fairly significant work at home presence before the pandemic even started. So sort of our employee value proposition sort of was we had a good value proposition before. It started net sort of carried through. And I think like all employers, what we're trying to do is take care of our people, do the right things from a reasonable in this standpoint and continue to focus on our mission. And that's what we're continuing to do. So I'm optimistic that we're going to continue to be able to staff our operation and provide the services that we need to all of our patients and members across the country.\nDirk McMahon: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly next, we'll go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up question on the 2022 early comments. A couple of variables there. One is, we think about Change transaction. I think you said, you expect it to close in the first half of the year. If you can give us an updated Change accretion number, I think was 20 to $0.50 previously for 2021. So how should we think about for 2022? And then I understand that there are a lot of uncertainties around COVID and $1.80 in net COVID headwinds but I think previously you quantified about $0.70 as coming from risk adjustments, so should we think that these at least are going to reverse next year and maybe how are you tracking with the annual wellness visits completion versus where you were last year or where you were in 2019.\nBrian Thompson: Thanks for the question, Ricky, I think a few components there and what get -- try to get it all those. So just in terms of the relates to change an impact, I just point out that we don't bring in acquisitions into our outlook until those close. So my commentary, doesn't anticipate change in there and we would look to bring that until it closes. When that is complete, we've no reason to expect that we wouldn't be trending along the same levels that we talked about prior. When that does come in, it's just a question of when it comes in and year and how the benefits play\nJohn Rex: They're just timing impacts in terms about when it would actually close during the year, but not incorporated in that outlook. As it relates to the $1.80 that we articulated last year, yeah, we broke out a number of different components that were important in that element. And frankly, my hope would be not talking about a COVID number by the time we get into '22, that we move beyond that and we can just move beyond to business as normal as we can while being always ready to address the environment that's at hand. But that would be certainly our intent as we'd step out here, that we'd be moving beyond that view. In terms of elements such as annual wellness visits and things, I'd ask BT to comment, A - Brian Thompson to comment a moment on that also.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, John. As you laid out at the beginning, while both our Medicaid and Medicare businesses are running still below baseline on a net basis, we are encouraged by the encounters with the physicians of primary care visits and annual wellness visits, as well as in-home clinical visits. Those have been encouraging. So I certainly expect less of a headwind in 2022 due to those encounters, certainly getting traction, certainly compared to 2021.\nJohn Rex: Excellent. Thank you, Ricky. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Next, we'll go to Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Can you talk a little bit about elective trends in September and as they moved into October, how that's changed at all, if you've seen any uptick. Also just on your commercial market growth, your membership growth in the quarter. Can you break it out between small group versus large group? Thank you.\nDirk McMahon: So thanks, Kevin. Let's let A - Brian Thompson address a couple of those.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Hey, Kevin, Brian here. As I think about elective care, what we've really seen is a pretty steady return to normal. We don't really see what I'll call as an unnatural suppression, nor have we seen a significant bounce back suggesting a big catch up. In fact, when you think about scheduled care, what we have found is it most of that cycles through in about 4 to 6 months, we look at things like colonoscopies and joint replacements as good leading indicators.  And those are running pretty close to baseline, obviously with the spike that we saw in September, there's a little bit of that, but we would expect to flow through in the fourth quarter, but that's fully accounted for in our outlook. And I would just say from a commercial perspective, maybe echoing what Bill said, feeling really balanced, really across our fully insured growth for the quarter. So just optimistic that that was across not only our group business, but we also saw a return of our non-exchange individual growth. So a really good quarter from a fully-insured perspective.\nKevin Caliendo: Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Yes. Next, we'll go to AJ Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just to drill down a little bit on the OptumRx and what's incorporated in '22 outlook headwinds and tailwinds, I know we had the vaccine this year probably helped script trends a little bit. We had some specialty conversions, maybe that helped, and obviously what was the dynamic around renewing contracts and so forth? What do you thinking about for '22 for OptumRx?\nHeather Cianfrocco : Hey, Heather. San Franco here. Thanks A.J for the question. So you mentioned, we talked in the second quarter a bit about vaccine. We saw a little bit of that this quarter in growth, but it's proportionately down. The last quarter I think was about a third of the growth this quarter, it's down to about call it between 20% and 25%. So you are seeing really our growth. First of all, in this quarter as a result of modest PBM growth together with continued in membership growth together with continued pharmacy services growth, when we look at '22, we're going to see that to continue.  Our pharmacy services growth, remember that's our home delivery specialty, infusion, the multi-dose, as well as our direct-to-consumer community, businesses, those will continue to grow in '22. We see those [Indiscernible] outpacing growth of the rest of OptumRx pharmacy. And I guess I'll call out a few things when I think about '22. First of all, we've made those investments and so we're seeing that we talked about [Indiscernible] in our community pharmacies. Dirk talked about those this morning and how they're growing, not just an expanded sites, but our existing sites are continuing to show really strong growth as they expand services to existing members, and expand in different types of health centers.  We'll continue to see that in '22. And we think the solutions we're bringing in an integrated way together with our consumer experience and our real push to make drugs, therapeutics affordable, and easy to access for our members will continue to see that. And I just put you -- point you back to our long-range growth, where we'll continue to be as in stable with our revenue on our earnings growth in '22 as we look towards our long-range plan. So thanks for the question.\nJohn Rex: That was great. And I think AJ, what that points out clearly a broad pharmacy portfolio with clearly a laser-focus on affordability and laser-focus on serving people, getting their medications and people sales where they need them, and basically servicing the entire, what I'll call pharmacy landscape with effective products and services. Thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning. I just want to go back to your comments around virtual care and a digital first product in 2022, can you talk about what that will entail first up? And then secondly, when you talk about connecting multiple channels of care in 2022, I would assume that's primarily keeping the patient in the home, but can you maybe just give a little more detail around what those programs would look like and what the potential cost savings could be?\nJohn Rex: First of all, let me hit on the virtual products that we have. I talked about it before, we're getting into from version 1 to version 2. The second version is really not telehealth as a standalone service, but really effectively integrated into physical delivery in total, courses of care. And so as I think about how we might -- how we're organizing our products, what we would have is a virtual PCP available to some people. And many people across the country don't have relationships with PCPs. So a product based on having virtual PCP, having that PCP managed like a Brick-and-mortar PCP.  And then manage the downstream expenses, being able to refer to digital properties, be able to, as I said, bringing a behavioral specialists, where needed. And as we sit and we look at some of the products that we have and we're designing, we're expecting probably about a 15% price advantage to other similar products in the market. So we're kind of excited about the efficiency of virtual in that context. So give me your second question again, Lisa. I was focused on virtual.\nLisa Gill: No. Just more around when you talk about connecting multiple channels of care in 2022. Should I assume that that's primarily connecting care in the home or is there something that I'm not thinking about?\nJohn Rex: No. You're thinking of this multi-modality, it's home, it's digital, it's what we do in the office. That's one of the things that we're trying to do. And I'm glad you hit on that. Our ability to serve people where they want to be served is something that we're really focused on across all three of our lines of business is very important. And clearly, people have different care needs and they have different preferences for care, and we want to provide that access across the board.\nDirk McMahon: Yeah. We say within OptumHealth or Optum Care, the build out of the home and community platform is one of the more important areas that Wyatt and his team are focused on. There has been lots of development there. Wyatt, maybe you could add a little color.\nWyatt Decker: Absolutely. So we're very excited about bringing virtual care, as Dirk said, in a differentiated way into people's homes so that they can access care. We can help TRIOS them and onboard them. We can provide primary care and when needed, we can provide care delivery in appropriate in some instances in the home, or we're leveraging particularly our urgent care platform to provide nearby physical care. And then we blended in our virtual and physical behavioral care deliveries as well. So we're now live in all 50 states, we're serving over 7 million members today, and we look forward to continue to expand these offerings. Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Operator. Next question, please. And I think we have time for about two more questions here as we approach the bottom of the hour.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So you touched on the topic, Medicare risk adjuster payments earlier. This was also a little bit more topical about a month ago with The Wall Street Journal putting a spotlight on it. So I guess I'm just curious if you have any updated high-level thoughts on MRI payments conceptually for the managed care industry overall. And do you see any potential reform of MRI near-term or do you expect status quo going forward? Thanks.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you very much for the question. First, let me point to the value proposition that Medicare Advantage provides, I think that's important context. MA serves 27 million Americans with very high quality care, and compared to fee-for-service Medicare it may cost less. It's more equitable, has better quality access and outcomes, and greater coverage and benefits with nearly 100% consumer satisfaction. Very important to the care that seniors receive, and it's important that we preserve the stability of this program that so many people rely on. And we think about the risk adjustment model in the payment system, the model has been critical to providing broad and equitable access to MA. Risk adjustment levels the playing field and ensures that there's no disincentives to care for the most vulnerable. So we really feel that it's an essential part of encouraging the right incentives in the program and think that it's something to build on and broadly support that we need to think about how to build on these positive elements and aspects of the program for which this is one of them.\nDirk McMahon: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please. Next and final question.\nOperator: All right. We'll take our last question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. I wanted to come back to the labor market and some of the things that we're reading new about provider financials. I was wondering what you're hearing from your network partners on this issue and how you think it will or will not influence rate negotiations over the next couple of years? Thanks.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks for the question. I think, yeah. What we're hearing from network partners is that their cost of labor is higher, so that comes up in the negotiations and like anything else, it's part of what we negotiate and how we try to work with our network partners on coming up with the right pricing and negotiating accordingly. Yes, we're hearing that there is obviously, there's staffing shortages. Obviously, many of the hospitals and other providers have to pay more for their input. And that's going to be reflected in the economics as we go forward. And of course, all that is reflected in how we price going forward. So yes, that occurs.\nJohn Rex: Thank you for the question with that, what I would just like to close with is as follows. Thanks everybody for your time and your questions today. We hope you're taking away the impression of a Company that's confident, it's opportunities and the ability to grow. And we're deeply aware of where and how we need to improve and we're fully committed to our mission of helping people lead healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. We look forward to sharing with you a more at our November 30th Investor Conference, hopefully in-person in New York. Thanks for your time today.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-07-15 13:59:02", "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 15, 2021, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrew Witty: Good morning and thank you for joining us. As we discuss our enterprise today, I hope you sense its growing momentum as we advance on our path of improving the quality, cost and experience of healthcare for everyone we serve. Both Optum and United Healthcare grew and delivered on our longstanding strategy, and we\u2019ve increased our outlook for the year to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share.  We continue to prioritize three key themes that we believe will underpin the next era of growth for our enterprise: first, unlock the collaborative opportunities within and between Optum and United Healthcare; second, increasingly apply technology to improve patient care and experience and to help the system run better; and third, strengthen our consumer focus, capabilities and value. During the quarter, we accelerated our efforts to develop and deploy new and innovative products informed by the insights of both Optum and United Healthcare in areas such as oncology care delivery, rare disease drug management, Optum Virtual, Optum Financial Services and many others. We are doubling down on efforts to both expand and link services where it creates value for consumers and patients to make their healthcare journey easier, simpler, and more intuitive.  We constantly challenge ourselves to develop capabilities which lead to improved care, better value, and a simpler system. Our sales to clients and partners across all parts of the health system demonstrate the strong relevance of our innovation and the strengthening of our sales pipeline is a key opportunity as we emerge from the COVID market pause.  A good example of bringing our collective strengths together at scale is the Optum home and community care platform, through which we care for nearly 10 million people. This platform includes our well-known HouseCalls service, comprehensive post-acute care for smoother transitions to home, and integrated primary and behavioral care for Medicare Advantage patients who prefer to receive their care at home. Home and community platform services can reduce post-acute medical care costs by a quarter, unnecessary readmissions by up to a fifth, and hospital admissions by up to 25%.  In Medicaid, we are addressing consumer needs by expanding our long-term collaboration with public housing authorities, working with government agencies and community-based organizations to identify and address specific healthcare issues for people who are hard to reach and support. In just the past six months, we\u2019ve introduced new partnerships in over 20 communities to close gaps in care and address health equity challenges. Using data and analytic capabilities, we\u2019re able to rapidly identify local health trends and gaps and then work with community partners to inform guidelines, training materials, processes, and create better tools to advance health. We believe this will result in better health of community members and help to optimize limited state resources. These and other targeted initiatives on the social determinants of health are essential elements and illustrative of our natural and longstanding ESG impact. Our recently published sustainability report captures the full range of efforts we\u2019ve dedicated ourselves to in areas of crucial concern to our stakeholders, none more so than advancing health and health equity. This agenda is an essential part of our way of doing business. I\u2019d like to thank our 330,000 colleagues from across the company for the passion and diligence they show every day in helping to deliver improvements in serving our members, clients and patients. I\u2019ve great confidence that we\u2019re emerging from the last 18 months of disruption with an unprecedented set of opportunities to help improve the health system for all of those we can serve. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to provide more detail on initiatives to drive performance across the organization.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. In an enterprise with our breadth of market engagement, we have many ways to assess how we\u2019re doing. I\u2019d like to share some of those metrics with you, picking up on Andrew\u2019s commentary on our three key strategic themes. First, collaboration. United Healthcare\u2019s value proposition is rooted in lower costs, better outcomes, and a better experience. Optum supports this value proposition for United Healthcare and other health plans with ambulatory services, which patients and their doctors value. In this quarter, we met the ambulatory surgery needs of over 250,000 patients, delivering exceptional care in convenient and affordable settings, with revenue growth approaching 20% over the non-pandemic affected 2019 second quarter. These centers are meeting higher acuity and more complex needs such as total joint replacement, spine and cardiovascular procedures, which are performed at an increasing number of centers. Our ambulatory settings receive a consumer NPS of 92 and we deliver better and more consistent quality outcomes at about half the cost of traditional settings. Optum Care has over 1,600 clinics and is rapidly expanding virtual offerings to serve patients in settings where they feel the most comfortable, and importantly with their own physician. Seniors served by Optum Care under our integrated care approach spend considerably more time with their primary care physicians than seniors in traditional Medicare and, as a result, spend one-third fewer days in a hospital. Second is our strategy to increase the application of technology to improve patient care and help the system run better. We recently announced the partnership with Bassett Healthcare, another strong example of how OptumInsight is helping health systems to expand and scale essential capabilities, including revenue cycle management and digital modernization to improve health outcomes and patients\u2019 healthcare experiences. We expect to continue to add new partnerships like this. Also at OptumInsight, we\u2019ve been tackling the most resource-intensive operations through the deployment of advanced technology and other approaches. For example, we have transformed what were once largely manual chart review processes into highly automated operations.  Third, we have been hard at work advancing our consumer capabilities. United Healthcare has made significant advances in the management of complex conditions. We\u2019re focused on making sure that patients with the highest acute care needs are able to access the most appropriate site of care by assigning them advocates to help navigate the system. Nearly one million of these members are matched with a personal navigator to help them manage and improve their health. OptumRx continues to improve access and affordability of home delivery for patients, leading to significant improvements in continuity of care and having already reduced the cost to process and dispense prescriptions by nearly 20% in just the past two years. Also, along consumer cost savings lines, for those who prefer an in-store retail experience, we now offer tools to find the lowest cost prescriptions near them regardless of the health benefits \u2013 of their health benefits coverage status. These tools can save self-paying consumers up to 80% on their medications.  Consumer preference is also having an impact in behavioral health. Already this year, the OptumHealth behavioral platform has delivered over 500,000 virtual visits, an option we initiated in just the last year. Many consumers and clinicians prefer these virtual encounters since they offer enhanced accessibility, flexibility and simplicity. Care encounters delivered through our dedicated channel have a patient satisfaction of 98%.  These are just a few of the many initiatives we are executing on as we apply technology, data and analytics to make our strategic growth agenda come alive. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the quarters to come. With that, now I\u2019ll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you Dirk. Our first half performance supports the foundation for strong and expanding growth for the remainder of this year and beyond. Before I review business performance, I\u2019ll offer a brief perspective on the pandemic-driven trends we\u2019re observing. The core takeaway is that our outlook for COVID-19 impacts is consistent with our past commentary. The second quarter showed overcall care activity continuing to trend toward baseline or normalized levels, albeit with variation across lines of business. For example, in commercial markets care activity was above baseline as members were willing and able to obtain needed care, some of which was deferred from prior periods. Our public sector markets continued to run below baseline, even as we are actively encouraging people to get their need. We were gratified to see care activity for these populations begin to progress over the course of the quarter as vaccination rates advanced. We continue to estimate approximately $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 impacts for full year 2021 and to expect the majority of these effects to occur in the second half.  Moving to overall business performance, OptumHealth second quarter revenue and earnings increased 46% and 34% respectively year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 43%, reflecting the impact of accountable arrangements and our expanding home and community health platform combined with the growing complexity of the needs we\u2019re serving. Of the 20 million patients we serve through Optum Care, over 2 million are in fully accountable or capitated care arrangements, an increase of 17% from a year ago, and we expect this pacing to accelerate strongly in the years ahead. OptumInsights revenue grew 12% in the quarter and earnings grew 36% with the revenue backlog increasing by $1.9 billion to $21.3 billion. Key growth drivers were managed services, the continued recovery of care activity to more normal levels, and further implementations of technology-enabled services. In particular, we are seeing strong sales momentum in the services, software and analytics business, which serve care providers. OptumRx revenue and earnings increased 5% and 19% year-over-year and script growth was 8%, with this comparison impacted by last year\u2019s pandemic-affected care patterns. Our expanding pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly, now comprising just under half of OptumRx revenues. Turning to United Healthcare, we are encouraged by the receptivity to our expanding set of responsive commercial benefits centered around virtual first, on demand and physician-led offerings. Year to date, we have added about 150,000 members in such innovative commercial offerings, even with the evolving and uneven labor market trends which impacted second quarter membership.  Medicare Advantage membership has grown by 675,000 year to date, tracking well to our full year outlook. Our house calls clinicians have been able to provide their vital services to seniors, conducting over 1.1 million home visits in the first half, more than double the year-ago level. People served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 920,000 over the year-ago quarter, in part as state-based redetermination activities remained on hold. Our Medicaid offerings continue to deliver a positive consumer experience and demonstrable cost effectiveness for our state government partners, and we look for this momentum to build heading into next year. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with second quarter cash flows from operations at $5.5 billion or 1.3 times net income, and we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 40%. In early June, our board of directors increased the dividend by 16%. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, we\u2019ve updated our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share, inclusive of the COVID-19 impact incorporated into our full year view. Within this, we expect the pacing through the second half to be fairly level. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. What we\u2019ve tried to provide you with this quarter, as we do each time, is a sense not only of what United Health Group\u2019s results are but how we achieved them. The examples we\u2019ve referenced and countless others throughout this enterprise, along with the consistent execution by our colleagues, are what underpin our confidence in our long term 13% to 16% EPS growth rate target and in our ability to help people live healthier lives and help the health system work better for everyone over the years to come. With that, Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. One question per caller, please. Alan, over to you.\nOperator: Certainly, sir. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] The first person we\u2019ll take a question from will be Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Great. Thanks. I guess you guys reported two good quarters in a row but raised guidance both times by less than the beat. You singled out the $1.80 headwind included in the guidance. Is there any other kind of major one-time positives or negatives in the guidance that we should think about when thinking about this year as a base for how to forecast future numbers? And is there anything offsetting the upside in the first half that we should think about in the back half?\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask John to give a little bit more detail, I mean a couple of things. Obviously, still too early to give you kind of real shaping for 2022, so you won\u2019t be surprised we won\u2019t go there.  And I would say, the overwhelming story for this year is of course the dynamic of COVID in terms of the various puts and takes, which are taking place under the surface. And as we\u2019ve done for the last several quarters, we\u2019ve tried to kind of dimension that within the $1.80. But as we\u2019ve also said repeatedly, the bulk of that $1.80 sits in the rest of the year, the year to go between now and the end of 2021. And so really, really pleased with the momentum and underlying performance of the company in the first two quarters of this year, but also respectful of uncertainties that remain around the COVID puts and takes. And of course, that all feeds into how we make the judgment on raising the earnings expectation for the rest of the year. I think where I sit, I feel great about that underlying performance so far. Broadly speaking, the COVID dynamic has played the way we would have anticipated more or less, but there\u2019s still a way to go and there are uncertainties within that. Maybe John, you might go a little further and take that $1.80 apart and maybe reflect a little bit on how you\u2019re seeing those different elements of the driver of that.\nJohn Rex: Kevin, good morning, it\u2019s John Rex. Yes, just to get a little further into those. So within the $1.80, we still expect about 70% of that to occur in the second half of the year, so the vast majority. A lot to be seen on how that $1.80 really plays out. Keep in mind kind of the main elements that, that comprises: It\u2019s the direct treatment and testing costs that we see, offset by elective care deferrals that might continue to occur or not in the rest of the year; the potential for higher acuity for those that have missed or deferred care; and at least within 2021, the impact of the care deferrals that occurred last year. So those are all super important components here. Within those elements, the things to play out would be most around the direct treatment and testing costs and the potential for higher acuity and how much care occurs in the back half.  The other elements within the $1.80, I would say, are more steady throughout the course of the year. So that point being around care deferral in 2020 and the related revenue impacts for 2021, those should be relatively steady, and I would say are running in line with the expectations that were set out for you back in December. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a surprise on that element within our outlook. And I would say, the kind of economic impacts also pretty relatively steady over the course of the year in terms of the quarterly progression, so those are really the elements that we continue to look for. You\u2019re right. Look, we saw good strength in a lot of the business, growth across the platform - really, we could point to every business. But it\u2019s that look out to really understanding how those trends play in the second half of the year. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. And Kevin, thanks very much for the question. Appreciate it. Next question?\nOperator: We\u2019ll next go to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Here with Mr. Percher as well. So our question again this quarter is around Optum Care. And I think the question is really how do you think about the capacity constraints for Optum Care? Is that more on the provider side, or gaining consumers in the totality of OptumHealth? And with all of these sort of new options or what appear to be new options available to physicians, how are you convincing docs that Optum is the best solution? And lastly, and I know I apologize for the last part here. But is there an argument to be made that Optum Care, not Optum overall, but just the Optum Care segment, would be more valuable to shareholders as a standalone company because of the physician independence issue that comes up?\nAndrew Witty: So, Josh, thanks so much for the questions. And before I -- I\u2019m going to ask Dr. Decker to make a few comments in a minute or two, but maybe just make a couple of introductory observations. So first off, I think, you\u2019re really starting to see OptumHealth broadly. And within that business, in particular, Optum Care and, of course, home and community really starting to demonstrate their capacity for growth because of the scale of the footprint that they now establish across the country. And I think you\u2019re starting to see these businesses move into a kind of critical mass dynamic, that\u2019s reflected in its overall growth. It\u2019s also reflected in this very rapid expansion of OptumHealth revenue per consumer, up over 40% this quarter. That\u2019s reflective of the quality of services, which are being delivered and the perceived value that they obviously reflect, so we feel very good about that. Your question around capacity constraints is a really good question. We continue to expand rapidly the number of physicians and clinicians in our organization, either directly or through affiliation. This year, we expect to add about 10,000, we\u2019re well over halfway through that journey, so going super well on that front. I would say one of the key elements is really making sure that those practices, as rapidly as possible, start to develop the skills to be able to manage capitated risk, which is really what then drives a tremendous amount of the distinctive behavior and value creation for patients and, of course, for the system. That process, I think, has been continually refined. As you would be well aware, in the marketplace people have tried different models, they don\u2019t always work super well. I\u2019ll maybe ask Dr. Decker in a second to dive a little bit more detail into some of the work they\u2019re doing there to accelerate that dimension of capacity, because it\u2019s not simply having the practices and the clinicians, it\u2019s having that way of working which really drives the change in what we\u2019re able to do. As far as your last question is concerned, I actually think that the OptumCare clinics within the broader Optum and UHG organization, that\u2019s where some of the magic really sits here in terms of being able to leverage many different aspects. And as you see these elements of OptumHealth and Optum Care, in particular, develop. You\u2019re also seeing significant amounts of support and help, if you will, being provided by other businesses across the organization. Payment integrity is a good example, beginning to be adopted by parts of Optum Care. So with all of that, I\u2019d like Dr. Decker maybe just to go a little deeper on how we move or how we help practices develop the capabilities, which allow them to deliver the value we\u2019re now seeing.\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, Josh, for the question. To Andrew\u2019s comments, we are increasingly bringing our depth and breadth in value-based care delivery to new markets that have been historically fee-for-service. And you\u2019ll see this unfolding right now and over the next year or two in markets like the Pacific Northwest and Northeast, where we have - we\u2019ve acquired and grown considerable clinical delivery assets. But we are now bringing the expertise in markets like Texas and Southern California, that have been delivering value-based and full risk capitated care for years. And so that really is a differentiator for us.  And the other piece I\u2019d build on is Andrew\u2019s comment around how we are creating a comprehensive set of offerings that address virtually every aspect of an individual\u2019s healthcare journey, from a focus on primary care and keeping you healthy and well, to post-acute care to end of life care and complex care in all environments, virtual, home, and in the clinic. And that to us, as we bring that together, connect the dots, is a differentiator in all markets. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Wyatt, thanks so much, and Josh, thanks so much for the questions. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi. Good morning. Many of the initiatives that you are putting in place and the assets that you\u2019re putting together are leading to lower utilization, at least in the hospital setting and a move to lower cost settings. Keeping this in mind, when we see the lower utilization at least on the public side, do you still think that 2019 is the right baseline for utilization?\nAndrew Witty: Ricky, that\u2019s a great question. You\u2019re quite right that a lot of what we focus on is--well, first and foremost, to try and understand what is the very best care that an individual need and to make sure that they get access to that, and one of the big things we\u2019ve been doing this year is trying to get people, particularly seniors, back into the system, those who maybe held back because of the pandemic, and as you heard earlier, we\u2019re glad to see some of that moving, albeit some way to go. Now within that, we also recognize there are a whole series of places where, frankly, there are better, more effective ways to deliver care. I\u2019m going to pick out one very simple example just to build on what you described. If I think about some of the work that\u2019s going into OptumRx and within our Optum infusion business, you can take drugs where perhaps $10,000, $15,000 per treatment for a hospital outpatient, exactly the same drug being delivered by Optum at-home infusion, $3,500. That\u2019s the kind of impact that we can deliver through really thoughtful application of location of delivery and the like, and that\u2019s just one example. UHC are very much focused on this in much of their guidance, and of course Optum is building a variety of different capabilities.  Having said all of that, I think the reality is it\u2019s very early days, even for us, in terms of changing behaviors against the overall trend of the healthcare system, so I think that baseline of 2019 probably is the right rational piece. Over time, I think these practices will start to bear down on the overall trend of cost, but of course that will happen as we see those capabilities spread more broadly, as we see them get more adoption and they start to change the price point in the marketplace for some of these treatments or therapies which are, frankly, overpriced. What our clients are looking for us to do, both through United Healthcare and Optum, is find ways to get great care at lower cost, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re focused on doing.  Ricky, thanks so much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to AJ Rice with Credit Suisse.\nAJ Rice: Hi everybody. I might just continue to focus on OptumRx - you\u2019ve got good script growth and a pick-up in margin there. There are two things that are sort of impacting script growth, it seems like to me, across some of the companies that are reporting it. One is how quickly we\u2019re seeing the rebound of the acute scripts as people start going back to their doctor and getting new prescriptions. Can you comment on where we\u2019re at relative to pre-pandemic levels on that? And then vaccines in some of the script reporting is having an impact - I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s relevant for you guys in OptumRx, but can you parse that out in any way? And then I guess just any comments on the selling season for OptumRx for this year going into next that you see.\nAndrew Witty: Listen, that\u2019s a great question, AJ, and before I hand it over to Heather Cianfrocco, our head of OptumRx, let me just make a couple of introductory remarks. That 8% script growth, about half of that is, we would estimate, kind of bounce back from the suppression at this time last year caused by the COVID--initial waves of the COVID disruption. But even having said that, the 4% residual growth is great and we feel very good about the performance of the OptumRx business across its breadth of businesses, so within the core PBM but also across all of its various other pharmacy services business, which the company has been investing in over the last several years. We did about 10 million vaccine prescriptions, I think, year to date. To give you a little bit more detail on that and a little bit further into selling season observations, maybe hand over to Heather. Heather, go ahead.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Thanks Andrew. Thanks, AJ, for the question. Yes, I think as Andrew said, maybe I\u2019ll take script volume quickly just to finish that off, and then maybe talk a little bit about selling season.  As Andrew said, really if you look at, whether ours is indicative of other things you\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019d say is specific to us, what you\u2019ve seen over the last year is, yes, about half of that is the rebound from compression and the rest of that is really a little bit of vaccine volume, and Andrew gave you the number there. But that really hits volumes for us more than anything else because of the ratio of revenue to scripts there. In addition to that, there is continued double-digit growth in the pharmacy services business, so that\u2019s making up the bulk of the additional growth that you\u2019re seeing year over year there.  As far as the split of acute maintenance, etc., I guess I would say--you know, we just had this discussion about what baseline is. I can specifically say that we\u2019re seeing second quarter looks more like \u201919 than it certainly did looking like second quarter of 2020, and we basically don\u2019t see anything unique there as far as acute versus--as far as acute ratio, kind of back to what we saw pre-pandemic for this quarter. Maybe let me switch quickly to selling season. We\u2019re still in the midst of it this year, and that\u2019s for all segments - that\u2019s for employer, it\u2019s for health plan, public sector and coalition. I\u2019d say generally same activity, maybe a little different pacing of decision making right now, but really in the midst of it. The biggest thing I would say about the selling season is clients very interested in solutions to address high cost of specialty drugs and getting to medications and therapies that really help on the medical and the pharmacy side, so for us we\u2019re very focused on those solutions and we\u2019re finding that our site of care services for alternative sites and alternative therapies, like biosimilars, together with some of our specialty programs that work through OptumHealth and OptumRx and straddle the medical and pharmacy benefit are really resonating, together with our really intense clinical client consulting that we\u2019re bringing to the market right now, so we\u2019re finding that resonating in the selling season and we think we\u2019ve got a lot of value to add there. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Heather, really appreciate it. I might just add, AJ, one other dimension that\u2019s under Heather\u2019s leadership, which is really pertinent to behavioral health. As I think we all recognize, that\u2019s a huge issue across the U.S. I think many of us anticipate the COVID pandemic and various impacts from that may well exacerbate some of the trend there, but I just wanted to call out the progress of Genoa Pharmacy within that. It\u2019s a business that came into our organization two or three years ago. We\u2019re going to open 60 more of those centers this year. We\u2019re already up to 582 of those centers, we\u2019re well on the way to close to double what we had when they first became part of the organization, and the impact that that group has is extraordinary, both from a consumer NPS score of 95, provider NPS score of 80, the impact they have in terms of helping improve adherence for highly complex patients, particularly those patients who are served through our Medicaid books of business is super important. So just wanted to mention that alongside the other elements of OptumRx, another key part of the growth, and a key part of where OptumRx is really helping our Medicaid business deliver really high-quality service for folks who need it. Next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the helpful comment that John gave during the prepared remarks on medical cost trends. For instance, John, you mentioned that commercial utilization was back above typical. Would love to know how that progressed during the quarter and how far above typical you saw it coming out of the quarter, what you\u2019re thinking for the rest of the year, and then any other commentary on Medicare and Medicaid there. Then also, if you could give us your view on this new Biogen Alzheimer\u2019s drug in terms of how you think things developed in terms of pricing and physician take-up or patient take-up rates, and how you think you\u2019re going to manage this process, would be great as well. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes Justin, thanks so much. I\u2019ll address the Alzheimer\u2019s drug issue in a second, but first of all I\u2019d like John maybe to pick up on your broader MCR questions.\nJohn Rex: Justin, good morning. A little color perhaps on how the progression occurred in the quarter here. As it relates particularly, thinking about the quarterly progression that we saw, perhaps not unsurprisingly COVID testing and treatment costs were highest in the month of April, actually trending up a little bit from what we saw in March, and that tracks with the incidence rate and the hospitalization rates that we would have been seeing, and then that trending down pretty rapidly in May and June in terms of the number of individuals in hospital beds and the treatment costs. In terms of utilization in commercial populations, interestingly that was also highest in the month of April, trending down a bit over the course of the quarter but still just marginally, very marginally above baseline as we end June, as we exited June, just to give you a little color commentary on how that was progressing. That was really the trending that we saw within that, and Andrew, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.\nAndrew Witty: Great, thanks John. The other thing I\u2019d say, Justin, is there\u2019s plenty of noise within those numbers that John just described, so you see inpatient, outpatient, physician visit trends by different books of business, it\u2019s a more complex picture than it looks on the surface.  As far as the Alzheimer\u2019s drug is concerned, I\u2019m going to--in a second, I\u2019m going to ask Dr. Migliori, our Chief Medical Officer, to make a couple of comments on this particular thing. Overall, bottom line from our perspective is this remains obviously a super important area for patients, families to look for progress in. We all want to see that progress happen. I think from where we stand today, there\u2019s still a lot of information that we need to be able to make really clear decisions, and I think we\u2019re not the only ones in that regard looking for greater clarity in this arena.  Maybe Dr. Migliori, you might give a perspective from the medical perspective, please.\nDr. Richard Migliori: Yes, thanks Andrew, and you said it well - we are encouraged to see meaningful progress being made against this devastating disease and advances in its treatment. We are continuing to develop our clinical policy as well as our ultimate position on coverage, but in doing so we\u2019re looking forward to getting the guidance that we need from Medicare, and also looking at the continually contributing clinical outcomes that are coming from--the clinical evidence that comes from the ongoing clinical trials.  But most importantly, we\u2019re looking for the advice from those expert, professional organizations, the physicians who have committed their careers to helping people with this devastating disease.  Andrew?\nAndrew Witty: Yes, thanks so much, Dr. Migliori. Justin, I think bottom line is I think this has some way to go before we get to real clarity, so I wouldn\u2019t guide you to expect very rapid decision making on this piece, not because we don\u2019t want to see these good effective treatments being made available - of course we do, but it\u2019s really important to have a real clear understanding of really how they should be used, what their value is in utilization, and as Dr. Migliori said really well, really understanding where CMS get recognized in that the MA population likely to be very significant fraction of utilizers, we need to understand where all of that fits. So I think this is potentially good news, but it\u2019s still early days and we have a lot more to learn before we can be more definitive than that, so can\u2019t be too much more helpful at this point, I\u2019m afraid, Justin, but thank you so much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks, good morning. I want to stick onto that last question. Sounds like commercial was marginally above baseline for the quarter. Hoping you can give us similar comments on magnitude of how much lower Medicare and Medicaid are, and then also if you could provide any sense of magnitude of the rising utilization you embed in guidance at this point for the second half of the year, if you could frame that just in terms of what normal growth would be and maybe what you\u2019re embedding, or how much higher guidance contemplates. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes Ralph, thanks so much. I\u2019m going to ask John to reflect on the second part of your question, in terms of forward-looking for the second half of the year. Just to nail this first part, though, the commercial book, as you\u2019ve heard already now from John a couple of times, basically right on baseline, maybe a hair above but right there, and then the two government books of business a few percentage points below, so I won\u2019t go further than that. Maybe John, you could give some insight into how you\u2019re seeing things within the next six months.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Ralph. Yes, so then you blend to a little bit--just a little bit below overall when you blend the books and you weight our books across in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the second quarter. Then as you might expect, that trends up progressively every quarter. Every quarter, you\u2019d see rising in that overall level of utilization and the expectations as we had into the end of the year. Embedded in that is also a view in terms of what happens with intensity, acuity levels. One comment--question that we\u2019ve often received is what are we seeing currently in acuity levels as we progress, and part of the impact as we progress in the second half is an expectation that you do see rising acuity levels. I\u2019ll tell you, we haven\u2019t observed that yet, but it still is probably a little bit early to say. Among the things we look at, we look at new cancer diagnoses, new cardiac diagnoses - those are still running below baseline levels that we\u2019d expect, but a view is that could continue to progress as we get into the back half of the year.  The other element in terms of just thinking about utilization and rising in the back of the year, and ultimately this is [indiscernible] what occurs with COVID testing and treatment costs. Clearly there\u2019s been the evidence of the new variants and their impacts in other countries and then also moving into the U.S., and even in our own data we can see that, but I would tell you still fairly limited in terms of impact. As I sit here and look at number of members, of our members that we have receiving treatment today, in hospital beds today as we sit here this morning, still well below the levels even as we sit here in mid-July what we were seeing in the April levels, but that could be a trend back factor also in the second half of the year as we see that progression. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: John, thanks so much, and Ralph, thanks for the question. Next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just ask a question around Medicare Advantage, and just interested in terms of what you\u2019ve been seeing progressing year to date around the risk scores and how that\u2019s been normalizing relative to the post pandemic disruption. Then, just also interested if you\u2019ve received the update yet from CMS on the midyear risk score updates, and if you could share how those came out relative to expectations.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for your question. I\u2019m going to pass that over to our new CEO of UnitedHealthcare, BT. BT, you and Tim might like to address those two points from Scott. BT?\nBrian Thompson: Sure, I\u2019ll start. I think as a follow-on, perhaps--this is Brian Thompson, thanks for the question. To the question around engagement levels, I think the piece that I am most encouraged by is the physician engagement levels, and in particular in our senior communities. We\u2019re really seeing strong receptivity, certainly reflective of the vaccination rates, and I think that\u2019s really giving us encouraging signals overall not only to 2022, but just the population and health at large. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim to talk a little bit more specifically about MA.\nTim Spilker: Good morning Scott, thanks for the question. The revenue for 2021 and the risk scores that support those are totally in line with our expectation, as John indicated in his remarks, and yes, we did receive the midyear payment from CMS which gives us a more fulsome view into what 2021 revenue is. Again, that aligns to our expectations, and at this point we consider 2021 revenue to be pretty complete in terms of what we\u2019re know about risk scores.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, BT, thanks so much. Scott, thanks for the question. Next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDave Windley: Thanks very much. I wonder, relative to your conversations about the relative headwinds, does your view of your ability to recoup the $1.80 in \u201922, is that influenced at all by the timing of when these things hit, if they do, in the second half of \u201921? I\u2019d be curious about your comments there, please.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, and I\u2019ll ask John in a second to give you more on this. First off, obviously again we\u2019re not going to be really shining a light on our expectation for \u201922 yet. Having said that, we also think the majority of the $1.80 headwind will have been utilized this year, will essentially be non-recurring. Of course, that depends on some assumptions around the pandemic itself remaining under control, so that is an observation which has to be taken in that context; but as we sit today, I think that is a prudent view. John, you may want to go a little deeper on how each of the elements perhaps you think about.\nJohn Rex: Sure, a few factors on that and how timing might impact those. Maybe just to refresh a little bit on that, Tim did a nice job describing the impacts in terms of the revenue impacts from particularly Medicare Advantage members being able to be seen by their physicians. We are encouraged by what\u2019s going on in our house calls activity - very strong receptivity to those. BT just mentioned we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in terms of seniors and their receptivity to even going in and seeing their physicians - that\u2019s all super important. I don\u2019t know if timing is so important on that piece, it just needs to occur during the year in terms of when that activity occurs, so that would be the more important factor as it relates to 2022 - does it occur in 2021, do they get in, so that\u2019s an important factor. Other factors here, I would say, there is care that didn\u2019t occur in 2020 and probably hasn\u2019t occurred in 2021 yet, that was deferred and needs to occur, so that\u2019s more about also an element of does it not occur at all in this year, does it work its way into 2022, and the potential for that and the revenue impact of whether or not there\u2019s an increase in acuity from those populations. Those are really the main elements, I would say, in terms of what I would call timing related. The other elements are more just--would be around this concept around the occurrence of COVID-19 incidence, direct treatment and testing costs, how that progresses over the back half of the year too. But those would be the elements that would be sensitive to timing factors.\nAndrew Witty: Right. John, thanks so much, and Dave, thanks for asking the clarifying question. Appreciate that. Next question?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, you made a comment about virtual first offerings helping to drive incremental membership growth this year. Can you talk a little bit about what the digital first and/or virtual first offerings look like, and then is that contribution in \u201921 and, if it is, could you talk a little bit about in the sales cycle, how it\u2019s looking for uptake in \u201922?\nAndrew Witty: Great question, Lance, thanks. I\u2019m going to ask Dirk in a second to make a couple of comments around the overall shift towards digital first, virtual first, and may also ask Dr. Decker to refer to some of further what\u2019s going on within OptumHealth, which is important around OptumVirtual.  As I\u2019ve made super clear over the last couple of quarters, really elevating our consumer focus is a top priority for the whole company, and that really speaks to ensuring that we\u2019re delivering simpler, more intuitive experiences, that we\u2019re thinking about the journey of the consumer and the patient in an end-to-end sense, that we\u2019re making it easier for them to make all of the very sequential decisions, and we also want to meet the consumer where they want to be met, whether that be outside of a facility, in their home, online or in person. We fully recognize how the premium the patients and consumers in particular, being able to talk to the physicians they know rather just any physician, and so how we start to pull all that together is essentially reflected in many of the different initiatives we have. Over the last few quarters, you\u2019ve seen us build up things like OptumVirtual - Dr. Decker will talk to you in a second, but things like OptumStore just being rolled out under the OptumRx organization really starts to bring together a ton of access for consumers in terms of what they\u2019re able to do with us. With that introduction, Dirk, love to get your perspective, and then maybe Wyatt. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yes, thanks Andrew, and Lance for the question. Of course, we continue to see telehealth be a broadly desired consumer access vehicle to the health system. We\u2019ve seen that grow. We\u2019re hoping we get to sort of the next generation, and we think a lot of that begins with--like for example, with OptumCare physicians being able to deliver that, because as Andrew said, people have a good preference to go to their own physician. The product with respect to virtual first, to answer your specific question, we plan on rolling that on in eight, nine markets in UnitedHealthcare at the end of this year. What it will basically be is--think of it as sort of a virtual PCP with an OptumCare doc being the quarterback, with the UnitedHealthcare navigate network backing it up for the physical access. We\u2019re starting to sort of, what I would refer to as productize this, and we\u2019re hopeful it will--which will aide to UnitedHealthcare\u2019s commercial growth. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Dirk, thanks. Wyatt, we\u2019d like to just get a little more on OptumVirtual and what you\u2019ve been building inside OptumHealth. \nWyatt Decker: Yes, thanks Lance for the question. We are bringing together the virtual care experience that we stood up rapidly during the pandemic with over 18,000 providers onto, as Dirk mentioned, a next generation technical solution that we\u2019ve created, which creates the opportunity to seamlessly onboard and triage an individual virtually, so we make sure they\u2019re getting the right care in the right environment, whether that\u2019s a virtual, physical or behavioral healthcare need. We believe that that is a differentiated patient experience. The second, which Dirk mentioned but I\u2019ll underscore, is a focus on primary care delivery and keeping people tethered to their trusted and known providers. As this matures--and we\u2019re live today in all 50 states, to be clear, and we\u2019ll continue to roll this out in a more comprehensive way to our OptumCare patients as well as members of UHC and other payors, and look forward to continued conversations about our capabilities here. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Wyatt. I think Lance, just to close this out, this is--I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s been built in OptumHealth here. If you think about this build-out of ambulatory clinic facilities and other attendant services, perhaps in the pharmacy space, you think about the home and community agenda, really investing to make sure that folks who want to spend as much time at home as possible are able to do that, and then you see OptumVirtual essentially pulling all of that together, you\u2019ve got to think about this as all three of those elements essentially all at play at the same time. I think it\u2019s a very important step forward that gives us a really significant opportunity to ensure that we deliver a much more seamless experience, we\u2019re much more responsive to consumer need, and we can focus on bringing costs down and delivering better care. That\u2019s what we really believe we can do here. You\u2019re going to hear a lot more about this. It\u2019s an important step up in the energy around our OptumHealth strategy. We just have time, I\u2019m afraid, for one last question, so Alan, if you could ask for a last question, please.\nOperator: Sure. We\u2019ll take our last question from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatt Borsch: Okay, thank you. I realize you\u2019re parsing through everything that happened last year and now the catch-up in care this year. Are you getting a perspective yet on how much of the care was unnecessary, that would have happened but is not actually going to occur, and I guess you could put that in two categories - care that you can see in hindsight was unnecessary, but maybe was necessary at the time because the person didn\u2019t know, and care that was just unnecessary proactively and in hindsight?\nAndrew Witty: Matt, thanks so much for the question. Really, it\u2019s a great question, and you would have to expect that the answer is that some of it would have been unnecessary. I think at this distance, it\u2019s a little hard to really call that at this point. I mean, there are some tantalizing signals in some of the trends, so if you look at emergency department use, for example, it looks pretty sustained down and doesn\u2019t seem to be coming back, and certainly if you look at our advisory board surveys that we\u2019re running with many, many non-UHC providers and institutions across American healthcare, people don\u2019t--a lot of people don\u2019t expect that ED utilization to come back. Now, that may be because they were being unnecessarily used, maybe folks have realized that urgent care centers are a much better option, maybe virtual is a much better option that they can get what they need at much lower cost.  Whether it\u2019s unnecessary, whether or not the pandemic has disturbed people\u2019s allegiance to certain types of sites of care and people are a little bit more open minded about where to go, all of that I think is in play. I would say it\u2019s premature to call it. I think we\u2019re watching it really carefully. I could build those theories I just shared with you. I\u2019m not going to tell you that those are proven. I think there is tantalizing signals in the data, but it\u2019s going to take another six, 12 months before you can really settle out how this all plays. But Matt, thanks for the question, and we\u2019ll probably loop back on that once again, I\u2019m sure.\nAndrew Witty: Listen everybody, I want to say thank you for all of your attention today, for your participation, very much appreciated. We hope very much that what you\u2019ve heard from out team gives you a flavor of why we have such confidence in the outlook for our company and for the ability of Optum and UnitedHealthcare separately and together to improve the lives of those we serve and the health system overall. With that, I\u2019d like to say thank you very much, and to close this morning\u2019s call.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-15 19:45:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I would like to introduce your host for today's program, Andrew Witty. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrew Witty: (Audit Start)Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results and positive outlook as we continue to execute on UnitedHealth Group's long-standing mission and strategies. The exceptional dedication of the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare again defined this period. They have adapted swiftly and creatively to demand and rapidly changing circumstances, implemented new ideas, and importantly remain focused on serving people exceptionally well. As a result, adjusted earnings per share were $5.31, reflecting strong execution at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum. In light of our strong start to the year, balanced with continued respect for the potential pandemic-related effects we have previously described, we are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.10 to $18.60 per share. I will touch briefly on two highlights among many in the quarter that illustrate the increased momentum our colleagues at UnitedHealth Group are driving. People served with our employer and individual offerings grew nearly 100,000 in the quarter, even within the context of a challenged U.S. employment environment, and this underscores the growing consumer orientation affordability and breadth of our products. OptumInsight revenues increased 14% and operating income increased 45% compared to the year-ago period as more normal activity levels among healthcare system customers returned leading to expansion in how we help them advance clinical and operational excellence. Significant innovation and automation in the OptumInsight businesses drove strong productivity gains. We have the right capabilities, assets, and strategies in place, and we remain restless to innovate, evolve, and further integrate our offerings to serve more people more effectively, both directly and with our many external partners throughout the healthcare environment. To achieve this, we have been sharpening our focus in three key areas. First, delivering even greater value to those we serve throughout the healthcare system by better harnessing the collaborative capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We believe we can develop new products and services we support people more effectively by bringing to bear greater application and adoption of the combined offerings of these two distinct and complementary organizations. Optum Care's work supporting Medicare Advantage patients illustrates this well and I will speak more to this shortly. The second area of focus, increase in the application of our technology and related resources to improve care for people and the operational health systems. There are benefits for everyone in helping to make the healthcare system work more like an actual system. Improving the natural flow accessibility and use of information is essential to that goal, all within a secure and protected framework. We can help care providers and payers better serve patients by more effectively simplifying key administrative processes and by providing timely access to relevant information. The third focus is making healthcare work better for consumers. We are ambitious to meet the rising expectations of healthcare consumers, and we will continue to improve our offerings included in such critical zones is greatly simplified, intuitive, and satisfying consumer digital experiences and advanced healthcare banking and payments services that enable people to find, price, and pay for care digitally. You will hear more from us about these approaches in the months ahead. But today, I would like to focus on the first, unlocking greater value for customers at the intersection of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, including through our ability to develop new useful service offerings. One of the most effective ways of doing so is through stronger alignment of the high-quality clinical services of Optum Care to address the needs of patients we serve for our nearly 90 health plan customers. A key foundation is increasing the clinical outcome accountability of our Optum Care practices. Of the four million patients who Optum Care serves in some form of accountable arrangement today, two million are being served under a fully capitated arrangement, and this demonstrates the strong growth and progress. But Optum Care serves 20 million patients in total, which is one reason why we view the potential of Optum Care as only beginning to be harnessed. These accountable arrangements drive measurably better patient outcomes and experiences, all at lower cost. For example, seniors served by Optum Care physicians under such arrangements spend on average one-third fewer days in the hospital and have 40% fewer days in skilled nursing facilities than seniors in traditional Medicare. We expect the growth in the number of Optum Care patients served under accountable arrangements to accelerate. A further example of using our combined expertise to advance more beneficial service offerings is the recent opening of a first of its kind Optum integrated care facility in Riverside County, California. While we have long offered and continue to actively develop our senior focused clinics, this new clinic and community center offers a comprehensive range of primary care led services including a pharmacy, all under a single roof; and importantly, it is especially orientated around supporting Medicaid, Medicare, commercial, and individual members of all ages. This comprehensive health center provides improved care access with modern on-site services, including annual wellness visits, chronic disease management support, coordinated care with trusted specialists, and laboratory, imaging and pharmacy services. The adjacent community center includes a full-service gym and meeting rooms for health education. We see Optum and our payer partners as uniquely positioned to be able to offer these types of impactful venues and look forward to learning from the community and expanding these services. To sum up, we continue to organize and apply the unique capabilities of this organization in ways that enable us to execute on the goals we established for 2021 and beyond and to continue to deliver on our 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth objective. Now, I will turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to give more color on initiatives to drive greater performance across the organization.\nDirk McMahon: Thanks Andrew. As Andrew noted, we continue to drive growth by supporting more affordable, simpler, quality care across Optum and United Healthcare. These are themes you have heard us cover before, and we continue to see the benefits of this approach for the people we serve. Let me turn those themes into some specific examples across Optum and UnitedHealthcare that illustrate how our approach is working. First is how we have been simplifying the consumer experience over the past year. We have driven greater engagement with seniors by increasing adoption of digital tools. Monthly active users of our digital offerings have risen double digit with similar increases in online transactions. This has led to greater adoption of our digital therapeutic offerings. In the first quarter, high-risk chronic disease patients in our home monitoring program logged over 1.5 million biometric measurements such as glucose level, enabling 99% medication compliance and an NPS of 84. (Audit End) We have also made it easier for people to get and maintain behavioral health support by expanding traditional and provider network and combined them with modern digital therapeutic services. Behavioral health needs have increased significantly during the pandemic. And as a result, we have seen substantial adoption in our digital behavioral platform that provides on-demand emotional support, logging a rise of over 100% in utilization. Always accompanying our work to simplify healthcare is Optum and UnitedHealthcare's sharp focus on delivering high-quality care. We have talked to you before about the advances we are making to integrate patient specific health data and plan information directly into the physician's workflow. Clinicians can see gaps in care and act to close them during the patient's visit in addition to other steps that facilitate more efficient care and better outcomes. We now support over eight million of these insight-enabled digital interactions each month with rapidly expanding physician adoption. Delivering high-quality care has been central in our response to the COVID pandemic. Our most recent effort to help members access vaccines is a prime example. We launched a vaccine locator tool, helping people find and sign up for a vaccination. And we have made millions of outbound contacts to engage members and help them get the information they need. Lastly, making care more affordable remains central for the people we serve and the health system overall and is essential for increasing access. For instance, through our medication sourcing program, high cost providers now source drugs at a network specialty pharmacy including OptumRx or charge market rates only for the drug. Early work on this has generated substantial savings for our customers. Our work to make health care simpler, higher quality and more affordable drives strong growth for our business. At the end of January, for example, UnitedHealthcare was awarded an Oklahoma SoonerCare Medicaid contract to serve nearly 200,000 people. Oklahoma previously operated under a fee-for-service program. The award affirms the value we bring to state partners and consumers and reflects our commitment to expand access to care for all Americans. We look forward to working with our new partners in Oklahoma and sharing with you on future calls new examples as our work on simplicity, quality and affordability continues to create improvements and new growth opportunities. With that, now I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you Dirk. Before I review the performance of our businesses, as in recent quarters I would like to provide an update on the care patterns we are seeing as the pandemic continues to evolve. Over the course of the first quarter, total care activity including COVID-19 related care ran marginally below seasonal baseline. Pacing of elective care activity through the quarter generally track and in opposite directions with the rise and decline of COVID incidence rates which were much higher in the early part of the quarter than in the latter part. To put this in perspective, February and March showed COVID-related care at about half the level experienced in January. Since the quarter's end, we have again began to see a rise in COVID-related care while at this time not approaching the January level. Outpatient care activity was moderately below seasonal baseline for the full quarter, running in counterpoint to the COVID incidence patterns over the three months and reflecting a well below average influenza and respiratory illness season. And total inpatient activity was modestly above seasonal baseline with over 55,000 COVID-19 related admissions during the quarter compared to 65,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Moving to business unit performance. OptumHealth's first quarter revenue and earnings increased 35% year-over-year. Revenue per consumer served grew 31% over the year ago quarter. The growth in this metric continues to reflect the expanding number of people served under value-based care arrangements and the increasing acuity of the care services we offer. OptumInsight's revenue grew 14% in the quarter and earnings 45%, due to growth in our services and technology offerings and improved productivity. The revenue backlog at $20.8 billion grew $1.6 billion over the first quarter 2020, as more normalized business activity started to return among our provider and payer customers. OptumRx revenue and earnings were relatively consistent year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Adjusted scripts declined modestly from the year ago quarter, a period during which we provided advanced medications to the people we serve as the pandemic began. Pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly, in particular home infusion and our community behavioral health pharmacies. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. First quarter operating result reflected strong execution and continued membership growth. In addition to the growth in commercial and Medicare Advantage offerings noted earlier, people served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 1.1 million over the year ago quarter. Of the 900,000 new seniors we expect to serve within Medicare Advantage this year, about 775,000 are in individual and group and 125,000 in dual special needs offering. Of importance to this, senior customers we serve, our HouseCalls clinicians have been considerably more able compared to this time last year to provide their vital services. We conducted nearly 600,000 home visits in the quarter as more seniors and care givers were vaccinated and comfortable having in-person visits. That's up by a third compared to first quarter 2020 and about four times higher than what was achieved in the second quarter 2020. Our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with first quarter cash flows from operations at $6 billion or 1.2 times net income. As we look forward towards the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our longstanding capital policies. These include our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platform. We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18.10 to $18.60, an increase of $0.35 from the outlook we offered at our Investor Conference. This outlook continues to include an estimated $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 related effects, the substantial majority of which we still expect to occur in the latter part of the year, largely as care is more freely able to be delivered to people. Now I will turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. The story you heard about this quarter is the story you have heard for many years and will continue to do so about UnitedHealth Group, a focus on better serving people and organizations in healthcare using the combined capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare to improve care, cost and experience and an unwavering attention to execute for excellence in all that we do. Operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: (Audit Start)Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.\nMatt Borsch: Hi. Yes. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. I have a question for you on the prior-year reserve development which is obviously a very large number. Can you just talk to where that emanated from in terms of components, whether by program or by quarter in 2020, and how that may be influencing your posture on forward reserving?\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks for the query. I am glad you asked that. I know a lot of people probably have that in mind. John, you should answer that, I think.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Matt, good morning. It's John Rex.\nMatt Borsch: Good morning.\nJohn Rex: Let me give a little color on that. So, yes, prior development, $1 billion favorable versus $850 million in the 4Q. As I am sure you would expect, that emanates heavily from the second half of 2020 and a lot from the fourth quarter. It was favorable really across the businesses. The elements there that would be driving that would be largely along care deferral activity that would have occurred in the quarter. I think when you think about impacts to the company and P&L impact, certainly there are significant mitigating factors that I know you are well aware, MLR rebates, risk order arrangements, reserve reestablishment that occurs. When I look at it and take it all together with those mitigating factors, P&L impact would have been in a similar zone to last year's first quarter with those elements coming in. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. Thanks Matt. Next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your question, please. Sorry, our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Jones: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question and congrats to Andrew and Brian on the new roles. Actually, I just wanted to ask one on OptumHealth. I think you said 35% of the growth there was driven by global cap. You also shared two million risk patients in OptumCare are now in global cap. Just curious if you could give a little bit more on kind of where you think this number could get to? The number of patients in global cap arrangements within OptumCare this year and then maybe over time, and then it would be helpful to understand a little bit just how many of the 20 million patients you highlighted are actually in MA today? Thanks so much.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Listen, Robert, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Wyatt Decker to add, you put your finger on a really key part of the growth strategy going forward. Clearly, you are going to see over this year and next year an accelerating move towards more capitated patients within the OptumCare universe. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, there's a tremendous opportunity as we look at those 20 million and growing number of patients who we look after migrating towards what we believe to a better mechanism to help them manage both their care outcome and also the cost implications. So, you will see that continue to accelerate as we expand our OptumCare networks. We are rapidly transitioning our capabilities clinic-by-clinic to be able to do this, and it's one of the areas I think we feel extremely optimistic about future momentum. But to give you a little bit more detail, Dr. Decker, who leads OptumHealth, please?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thank you, Robert, for the question. And Andrew, I think you set it up nicely. OptumCare has become the nation's preeminent ambulatory delivery of value-based care. It is physician-led and increasingly you will see us bringing comprehensive services to bear to meet the needs of all of our patients with a particular focus on value base and a particular focus on the fully capitated individual. We will continue to grow over 250,000 lives this year, and you can expect that to accelerate in the years to come as we continue to attract individuals through organic growth as well as through our partnership with UHC, and as Andrew mentioned nearly 90 other providers. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Wyatt. And thanks Robert, for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.\nAndrew Witty: Hi Lisa. Go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I am just curious how we think about digital and telehealth impacting medical costs? What you have seen thus far? And what's the future role post the pandemic when we think about helping to control costs from a telehealth perspective?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, that's a great question, I am going to ask in a second Dr. Decker. And also I think will ask Dirk McMahon to make a couple of comments, but let me just preface that. So, we have obviously seen telehealth develop as a set of capabilities over the last several years. We have been a very extensive user of those capabilities, but I think one of the things we have seen from 2020 and the pandemic is really a kind of shift in terms of people's thinking and willingness to utilize telehealth. We also think that the way in which they are being utilized is evolving. And so, what you are going to see from us and it is one of the examples I might cite in terms of the opportunity for new product development between Optum and UnitedHealthcare is, you are going to see UnitedHealth Group lean forward into much more integrated telehealth capabilities. We have got a number of new initiatives in deployment as we speak operating between the two companies. And with that introduction, let me pass it over to Wyatt to maybe give you a little bit more detail on that. And then, I think it would be good to hear from Dirk the perspective he has on this. So, Wyatt first.\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Well, thanks for the question. And as you heard us mention before, we are very proud of how quickly we stood up over 17,000 providers during the pandemic on telehealth solutions, but that really just is the beginning and of course across the country, we have seen a massive shift in consumer adoption and willingness to engage in virtual health solutions as well as with our providers more broadly. (Audit End) So our philosophy is that, not all telehealth is created equally and as we continue to develop our new products, you will see us integrating physical care, virtual care, home care and behavioral care in a way that is innovative and differentiated. And in fact, we have already launched a product we call Optum Virtual Care that is live in all 50 states and is doing just that. And what will really differentiate our product to those that we serve is the ability to offer virtual solutions but then, if necessary, immediately connect them to a live bricks-and-mortar solution for more complex or thorough care as well as identifying and triaging both physical and behavioral health care needs and offering comprehensive behavioral health care. We are seeing continued sustainability of virtual care solutions which as you may know peaked during the height of the pandemic have declined some but are still probably 10x where they were pre-pandemic and certain conditions or behavior or areas like behavioral health care are now seeing about 50% utilization through virtual services. So we are very excited about where we are going to take this. I will turn it over to Dirk.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Thanks Wyatt. I think Andrew and Wyatt pretty will drained it. But let me say a couple of things. First, we know that people want to meet with their doctor and we have been focused on facilitating that with OptumCare. And people, basically, as you look at how things evolve, the brick-and-mortar physician, that's the vast majority of the tele business today. I would also say that I do see a tremendous opportunity for new models and new products strategies with OptumCare and others where we lean towards those providers who have again the best outcomes and provide the most efficient care. So like any other doctors in our network, we at UnitedHealthcare going to be looking at that strongly and we think OptumCare can provide that very well. That's it. Thanks Lisa.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Dirk. Thanks Wyatt. I have got to say, Lisa, I have been keeping an eye on the patient verbatims as we have been deploying the Optum Virtual platform that Wyatt referred to and really the feedback is really extraordinary in terms of how patients are seeing this, the benefit they feel from that and the ease with which they are able to engage with it. So this is exactly the kind of thing you are going to see going forward. I think Optum is in an extremely advantaged position being able to bring together this notion of integrated telehealth with physical and behavioral health. And that's going to be the path we go. And I think we are on the verge of kind of next generation of what this looks like versus what we have seen previously. So Lisa, thanks so much for raising the question. And next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your question please.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess one clarification first I guess. Does your guidance assume anything for sequestration delay? But then I guess the real question is, the $1. 80 that you guys are still including in your guidance, it sounds like things are starting off the year relatively well with the overall utilization coming in better and membership growing and some of the OptumInsight things kind of normalizing. I guess, how do you think about that $1.80? How is that progressing? And what kind of signposts you need to kind of see before you feel like that number might come in lower than that?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Listen, Kevin, thanks for the question. I am going to ask John in a second to refer to the $1.80, the math I guess behind that and the underlying trends. As far as sequestrations comes in, obviously we are keeping a close eye on the guidance from the administration. We have clearly seen the extensions. But the guidance raise we have given today is not caveated by that in anyway. So we have our assumptions on that but the guidance stands not withstanding any outcome there. John, on the $1.80?\nJohn Rex: Yes. Kevin, it's John Rex. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about that and how we think about that progressing throughout the course of the year. So a few impacts here. I think the first, the important impact, I suggested that if a significant majority, I would call it, 70% of our projected COVID impact is really occurs in the second half of the year. And just to be frank, we just don't know enough now about what is going to happen later in the year to kind of have a very meaningfully different projection of what our full year results will be in terms of, will it be better in terms of better than the original projections, except for what we have experienced thus far which we expected some stronger underlying business performance growth across the number of businesses. We have executed well on productivity measures. And maybe just very modestly less impact in the 1Q unfavorable impact than we would have anticipated. But the important component there being that is really much more a back half weighted view in terms of COVID-19 impact. That's really premised upon our expectation that as we get later in the year, people are going to be more able to access previously deferred care and at higher acuity levels as a result of missed or postponed treatments. And that's what we have build into that view in terms of an expectation. But that's really unusual time still, no question. And we have therefore increased our full year estimate by what we know today.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And Kevin, thanks so much for asking the question. I mean I think John really summarized it super well. We have raised our expectations for the year based on our experience so far this year and we have retained that $1.80 assumption, if you will, in terms of what could happen. But we obviously don't have the detailed visibility of that yet. But we feel that's the right balanced stance to take in terms of the rest of this year. So I hope that's clear and thanks so much for the question, Kevin. Next question?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Your question, please?\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning here with Eric Percher as well. So our question this quarter again on OptumHealth and appreciate the comments in the prepared remarks and the Q&A. But I want to speak to the ultimate strategy around the accumulation of employed physicians. And if this is all about a move to global capitation and we are really more interested in the how, right. Is this more center based like what you are talking about in Riverside, California? Is this more of a technology overlay that enables the physicians to do this? And then I would again, how many of this 20 million, I understand 250,000 will move this year, but how many of those 20 million will ultimately end up in global cap, in your mind?\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks for the question. And before I pass it to Wyatt again to respond to the specifics, let me just give you a sense of how we see this play now. And I think the answer to your question is really both. So we absolutely see tremendous opportunity to continue to develop a variety of different clinic types. And if you look at the, I cited one particular example but we have been open in a wide number of different type of clinics depending on the environment over locality that we are operating in. And you should continue to expect to see that degree of customization according to the need of the geography. It's not a one size fits all model, by any means. So you will continue to see that. But at the same time, we strongly believe there is opportunity over the next few years. And this is why I focused in my kind of second there over going deeper around technology. How we can then help those clinics operate more efficiently? How we can ensure they are better connected, both locally with other clinics that we may own or to a high level of information support. So we see this as being a highly activated network of clinics and centers. The center, the network itself will have a high degree of diversity in it because it needs to be responsive to the needs of the locality, the community that we are operating in. And of course, as sensitive to the previous comments, it will have a very significant telehealth capability deployed alongside it. But Wyatt, maybe you could talk a little bit to how you see the progression within the 20 million?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thank you Andrew. Thanks Josh. Great question. We will continue to evolve. And one of the pieces that will differentiate us as comprehensive care providers is just that, being comprehensive. And so you will see us continuing to weave together products and services that meet people's needs in new and innovative ways. And telehealth and digital solutions are a big piece but not the only piece. The other part that I would call out is, we are increasingly leveraging technology to bring advanced decision support to our physicians and providers. And you may have heard previously about OptumCare. This is a value-based care delivery set of decision tools that are yielding real results, giving people the best, highest quality care that eliminates what we tend to call low value care and is a differentiator. So we will continue to deploy those technologies. As you know, we are on track to grow by over 10,000 physicians. We are now at 56,000 doctors, both affiliated, contracted and employed and we will leverage all of those models as we go forward and we continue to evolve and employ doctors who are really actually quite attracted to our model of value-based primary care. We eliminate much of the clerical burden in our physicians in advanced practitioners' practice and let them focus on the work they love. So this is really gaining traction among our physician workforce. And then to your point around how much of the 20 million lives that we serve today will ultimately be capitated, we anticipate that not only will a significant portion, you heard the number two million today and 0.25 million as we mentioned growing. So as we continue to grow, we also expect that we will always offer a host of modalities including fee-for-service. And that actually is a feeder system, as we think about value-based care being kind of the core of what we offer and fully capitated, the core of the core, if you will. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Wyatt. And maybe I will just ask Dan Schumacher to briefly add to the comments and talk a little bit about Optum At-Home which is a further dimension of this. So go ahead.\nDan Schumacher: Thanks Andrew. And great question, Josh. To the question around sort of center-based, tech-based, data-enabled and different versions of that that Wyatt was talking about, Optum At-Home is a great example of a collaboration between UnitedHealthcare and Optum that's in relatively early stages. But we focused on Medicare Advantage members that are in dual special needs plans initially. And that's a full risk offering and we are doing it in markets where we don't currently have local OptumCare practices. So what we are doing in the program is really both providing care but also arranging and coordinating care. So we are trying to address medical, behavioral and social needs and the results initially have been great. We have improved access for people with more than 80% having in-home visit and more than half of them getting connected back into office-based care, social services referrals and so forth as well as great health quality and outcome. So today we have got a little under 100,000 lives across six markets. We are looking to expand that across the Medicare Advantage Dual SNP but also into the individual MA we are doing with UnitedHealthcare and ultimately look to do that with other health plans. So another growth vector for us as we look at building out our value-based orientation.\nAndrew Witty: So Josh, I mean I know that was a little bit of a long answer from the three of us, but you asked a really important question. And this is really one of the core elements of the future of the company. And it's why you have heard us talk so much about OptumHealth, OptumCare and you can see the growth potential. We are at that two million life level now. We clearly see the capitation strategy as a highly effective strategy to deliver both quality and cost management for patients. That movement is really significant and it's really moving strongly. And with the development of the diverse sets of clinics and skills, the development of the technology support that you have just heard refer to, we believe we are in a very strong position to be able to be the leader in ability to manage those patients in the best possible way and ensure that they get the kind of health care they deserve. So Josh, thanks so much for asking the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. If we think about the utilization, you gave us some data on how utilization is tracking. But can you give us little bit more details on how it's tracking across the different patient population? And also we talked about acuity levels, your expectations for acuity level to step up second half of the year. But from the experience to-date, as you are starting to see individuals that are coming back, what type of acuity you are seeing for those that haven't received care for the last year? And I think the final one there, if you can just remind us as you think about that guidance for the full year, are you assuming that utilization by year-end is going to be above the 2019 baseline?\nAndrew Witty: So great question, Ricky. I am going to ask Brian Thompson, who has recently been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare, to respond to that. So, BT?\nBrian Thompson: Yes. Thanks for the question there. When I think about baseline, what I can say right now is, what we are seeing is largely tracking to our expectations. And as we had signaled, where we see abatement in services, it's largely offset by the increase in COVID-related costs. And that's tracked as we had expected. When you back out the impact of some suppressed utilization, the underlying factor is associated with medical cost trends largely look like they did. We aren't seeing significant upticks in services in specific areas out of the norm. So I would say, it looks a lot like utilization prior to the COVID implications. And when I think by line of business, I would say, generally tracking a little below baseline in both our government programs, closer to baseline inside our commercial business. But largely in track with what we had expected. And where it's a little out of line again where perhaps infection rates were higher, we saw that naturally offset with greater utilization. So first quarter, I would say, largely as expected.\nAndrew Witty: John, do you want to add?\nJohn Rex: Yes. Ricky, good morning. It's John Rex here. So as Brian noted, one of the aspects we look for is this rising acuity from patients that have deferred care or missed treatments. And at this point, we don't have evidence of that occurring. And it could be just that it's still too early on to have enough evidence to see it. But we have not yet seen that rising acuity in the populations that we serve. Your point in terms of how we think about as we get later into the year and why that moves like it does and you heard my commentary that a significant majority of the $1.80 we have layered into the second half of the year. That is largely because of the assumptions around those elements that we see that people are increasingly able to get the care they need, the amount of care deferrals declined meaningfully as you get into that latter part of the year. They are accessing the system. And we do get into these elements where we see rising acuity coming in. So those are the elements that are premised in terms of that expectation at this point. But really and the other element that Brian touched on also just in terms of your populations, you have commercial, a little more access to the system versus the public program members. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And thanks, Ricky, for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nDave Windley: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask a question about integration and longitudinal care and data versus fragmentation. And the question is this. So Andrew, over many years, Optum has really invested a lot of money in kind of aggregating data about the patient status, care and services delivered, so that touchpoints with United or Optum could have all that information at hand. I guess what I am interested in around kind of your build-out but specifically the comments you have made about telemedicine is, how important is it for telemedicine to enhance and augment the longitudinal and integrated nature of care versus fragmenting that by having it kind of siloed as a separate benefit? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Right. It's a great question. So I think our bias is increasingly and I think rightly toward driving a more and more seamless, simple, easy to access care environment, both for the patient and the provider actually. So what that speaks to is, trying to avoid the fragmentation of the interface and definitely trying to avoid the fragmentation of the information that then sits behind it. So we want to really try and create much more seamless opportunity. So for example, I would give you a real example in Optum Virtual which is, you have heard a little bit on the call already today. So of course, patients are looking for a way to engage with the physician. They actually want to talk to their physician. So one of the things that we are doing is building that platform. But then there might be situations where the physician wants to bring in a specialist into that conversation. Now in a multi-disciplinary clinic, they might be in a position in normal times to go down the hall, get somebody to come down and visit. Now in Optum Virtual, they are able to do that kind of thing. So that's an example of trying to bring that integration, even within the virtual space. So it kind of replicates a little bit more what you might expect in a physical environment. And so, we definitely see the need to try and drive toward that. And we definitely want to try and create the fluidity of the information to ensure that physicians have what they need when they are in front of the patient, when they are talking to the patient so they can make the best possible choices. So we want them to be as highly educated as possible in that context. So we are leaning very much towards the idea of integrated seamless and that's true whether you are in the physical or the virtual space and we want the two to sit together. Thanks for the question.\nDave Windley: Yes. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Next question. Thank you.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. A lot of good topics already covered here. So I just have a few quick follow-ups. First, the detail on OptumCare was very, very helpful. I was hoping I could ask for one more piece of information here which is, so it sounds like you are going to have 18 million people out of 20 million that are still not capitated. Wondering how many of these are sitting in Medicare Advantage plans that aren't capitated, given this is where most of the capitation happens? Just trying to think about the potential kind of pent-up growth there. And then on Medicare Advantage, it sounded like your health assessments are going better in 2021. Should we expect that you should get a significant amount of that risk or headwind that everybody saw for 2021 to reverse next year and get those revenues back? And then lastly, could you give us an update on earning seasonality for the year versus a 50/50 split you talked about on the last update? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hi Justin. Thanks so much for the questions. I am going to ask in a second, John to talk to the earning seasonality and for Wyatt to address the degree to the population we have within the MA plan. Let me just touch on the health assessment. You heard in the prepared comments the very strong performance of the HouseCalls program, actually higher than last year, record quarter actually in terms of performance at HouseCalls. And you are quite right, that makes us feel pretty optimistic that that headwind that we saw is going to dissipate pretty rapidly as we rotate into 2022. And that gives us kind of a rise in optimism that much of that kind of the negative headwind that characterizes the emergence of the pandemic starts to mitigate at least on that dimension. Obviously, we don't know what's going to happen in the next few months with this disease. But as we sit here today, that would be the right kind of expectation to look at. Let me go to Wyatt first. And then John, if you pick up from Wyatt on the seasonality. So, Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. And of the individuals that we serve that are not in fully capitated programs, about a third of them are seniors. And so you can think of that as the Medicare population that we serve through a variety of touchpoints in our care delivery assets. And then as you would expect, a subset of those are already in MA plan, which is to your question. And so, we see, again, a great potential to continue to capture and enroll and care for MA patients through OptumCare's delivery capabilities. And you will also see us going deeper in the markets that we are in and bringing our very mature risk-based platform in established markets to new markets where today we are primarily fee-for-service. So expect both geographic growth and increasing depth and penetration in the markets we serve today. Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Justin, good morning. This is John. In terms of the seasonality, so historically we have been at, what I would call, a kind of 48/52 split in terms of first half, second half. I would put that probably more in the zone of first half being in the 52, 53 zone this year. That is really due to how we are tracking in the $1.80 per share impact on it that the majority of that is occurring in the second half of the year. So that would be really the reason for the seasonality looking different this year than it has looked in other years. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And thanks, Justin, for the questions. I appreciate it. We just have time for two more questions, operator. So let's go to the next one.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your question, please?\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Maybe drill down a little bit on OptumInsight. Obviously, it had a really good margin trend this quarter. I wondered, because I know there was discussion last year during the pandemic that some of the John Muir type of deals were somewhat on hold as it was tough to sell a health system on that, given social distancing and so forth. Since the fact that you don't have investments for those, is that helping you on the margin right now? And are those now basically reopened that you can go out and bid? And maybe another aspect of the OptumInsight story, as you think ahead now to Change Health coming on board, should we assume that there is a pause in selling activity of some sort while you integrate that and position the company to be even stronger and that business to be even stronger? Or I know there's a lot of synergy assumed to be coming online with that? So how should we think about how Change Health coming online affects the trajectory of that business?\nAndrew Witty: Hi A.J., thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Robert Musslewhite to make some comments in a second around the progression of the margin in the quarter, which obviously we are very, very pleased to see that. And it was due to a ton of hard work on a number of different dimensions that Robert can describe to you. Just on those large contract agreements, like the one we have with John Muir. Yes, there was a bit of disruption last year. But I would say that is absolutely back on stream now in terms of a line of business for us. And we have a very, very exciting pipeline. And that pipeline exists both in the short, medium and longer term. So that's an area you are going to hear more from us on and is absolutely back in full swing. In terms of Change, obviously we are very keen to continue to work through the regulatory process. We expect this to close in the second half as we have previously indicated. And you should not expect any disruption from us bringing Change onboard to really anything that we are doing and especially not in terms of our selling activity. So we absolutely continue to operate OptumInsight fully as if we were not in a transaction. And even post-transaction, I would fully expect the ongoing sales energy of the company to be not disrupted. So nothing. I really would not lead you to expect anything on that front. With that, Robert, would you go into a bit more detail, please, around the evolution of the margin during the last quarter?\nRobert Musslewhite: Sure. And hi A.J. Listen, we are pleased with the quarter. It was a really good quarter on the topline and that of course profitable growth that contributed to margin. But specifically on margin, we also are really seeing the results of a lot of the modernization work we did across 2020. So last year, we undertook a significant review of the business across the operations and drove to find some multiple ways to drive stronger and more efficient performance and help ensure that the investments we are making were invested appropriately against our key growth opportunities. And so if you look at those initiatives, multiple automation initiatives using advanced techniques in AI, MLP, machine learning, it really drove a lot of short-term productivity. But it also drives a situation where we feel like we have made sustainable margin improvements for the longer term. And that puts us in a position to be more competitive. And that actually rolls over to exactly what you are mentioning, being more competitive on the large engagements. And as Andrew said, we feel really optimistic about that pipeline and where it's headed. The disruption was more in timing and not really an interest during the pandemic. In fact, during the pandemic, I think there was growing recognition among our health system relationships that this was a very productive way to work with Optum and a really important need for them as they face some disruption even coming out of the pandemic to their finances in ways that we can sustainably support them in a really holistic way. So we feel like that's a great path forward. We are excited about the business and feel like we have made some important changes that put us on a really good track going forward.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Robert. And A.J., thanks for asking the question. And Insight, I think, is really on the cusp of a very exciting few years, thanks to the significant work that was done last year, the increasing rate of opportunity that we see to bring in new significant contracts and then obviously the pending Change acquisition creates some really exciting momentum for this business. So this is an area I fully anticipate us looking to for material growth going forward. Operator, last question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche. Your question, please.\nGeorge Hill: Hi. Good morning guys. And thanks for squeezing me in at the end. Andrew, I would just be interested to hear your commentary about the outlook for commercial bundles. I know we are all talking a lot about risk-sharing and what I call risk syndication in the Medicare Advantage space and the bundling of risk in the Medicare Advantage space. But I would be interested in the company's outlook for the commercial business and if you are seeing increased uptake of kind of more risk-sharing tools in that market? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Great. So listen, I think in the commercial space and I am going to ask Bill Golden to come in here real quick. But I think in the commercial space, it's just as possible for us to start to design innovative products and we have already begun to do that between Optum and UHC. Let me ask Bill to dive into that in a little bit more detail. Bill?\nBill Golden: Yes. Thank you. And thanks for the question. Yes, I would say, we are in the early stages of provider-aligned products where we are taking advantage of that risk base. As an example, in our Southern California OptumCare partnership, Harmony really continues to be a cornerstone of those offerings. We are learning a lot with that product, not only regarding how it's priced, but more importantly the actual experience for the members. And so we are using that as a cornerstone and as a program to continue to roll out throughout the country with other areas. So we are very optimistic about the opportunities that that will show in the future. But still in the very early stages of our global cap with the commercial business. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Bill. And George, thanks so much for the question. That's clearly an area we expect to see more in the future. But as Bill says, it's early days and we will see how that progresses. With that, everybody, thank you so much for spending the time with us this morning. As we move through what we all hope are the latter stages of this pandemic, you can expect us to continue to focus on the areas where UnitedHealth Group can do the most to improve healthcare, including adding even greater value at the intersection of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, applying our technology and expertise to create a better functioning, more responsive and cost-efficient healthcare system and making healthcare work better for consumers. We look forward to connecting with you again on these priorities in the weeks and months ahead. And once again, thank you for your attention this morning. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentleman, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."}], "2023": [{"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-01-13 11:58:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial & Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com.  Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 13, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the course of the past year, the extraordinary and dedicated people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered strong, well-balanced growth, progress in developing our consumer-orientated capabilities and strengthened the many ways in which we deliver value-based care in multiple settings. Each of the five growth pillars we discussed with you at our November investor conference are powerful sources of opportunities on their own within large and expanding addressable markets. Yet what really unlocks the potential value we can provide to those we serve is the connectivity of capabilities across our enterprise. For example, this year, we expect 4 million people will participate in fully accountable value-based care provided by Optum Health, almost 1.8 million more than we served as we entered 2022. We're achieving this by connecting benefits, care and other services to support our patients. Many of these patients will have a Medicare Advantage plan offered by UnitedHealthcare, or one of the many other payers who are accessing Optum's expertise and capabilities in delivering this kind of comprehensive care. We will serve these patients in clinic settings, in their homes, integrating behavioral care, supported by our data-driven clinical incidents and next best actions, and all coordinated to provide the right care when and where they need it. Pharmacy is another area in which we are more deeply connecting consumers with our services. We engage 1 million people every day, finding the lowest cost options, managing their specialty drugs, offering vital in-person clinical advice at our community pharmacies, providing complex medication treatments right in their homes, or simplifying access through digital solutions in order to make the process uneventful for them. We believe this connectivity is a path to better outcomes for people and lower costs. It's also driving growth. By the end of 2023, we expect to have more than 750 community pharmacies, nearly 200 more than we had at the beginning of 2020. We continue to see the impact these services have at a very local and personal level, helping providers deliver more complete care and better outcomes, including medication adherence rates, which are about 90% compared to the 50% U.S. average. Our pharmacists are able to take the time to get to know their patients' treatment plans and support their medication management, collaborating with other care providers. We're guided in pharmacy by the principle of getting to the lowest cost for patients and clients. A good example, as more biosimilars come to market, we're positioned to offer patients their care providers and payers significantly more choices in how to secure the best prices for the therapies they need. In addition to biosimilars, we're driving affordability and prescription benefits by combining formulary and cash market pricing to ensure consumers will always get the best economics. Our life-saving drugs program has made very significant progress since our announcements last year. This program offers zero dollar out-of-pocket cost to consumers for drugs such as insulin and epinephrine. Our goal has been to make this available throughout the U.S. And as of today, we've been approved in 48 states for our fully insured business. Moreover, 1/4 of our self-funded employers have now chosen to add this offering for their employees, and we expect that number to rise. Getting to this point in such a short period of time was only possible through the work not just of our teams, but of state officials and others in the broader healthcare community and we're grateful for their support.  Looking to the year ahead, let me focus you on a couple of themes you can expect to hear from us. One is continued scaling of our commitment to American consumers. You should and will have -- who should and will have an increasing influence over their care experience. Through our core innovations, product design, enhanced digital offerings and partnerships such as RVO Health and Walmart, you will see us driving this more broadly across the enterprise, becoming closer to the consumer, helping simplify their experiences and empowering their decision-making with greater transparency, speed, convenience and support. You will also hear how we are amplifying our technology capabilities.  2023 will see the emergence of an enhanced OptumInsight, bringing to life the opportunities that the legacy organizations from Optum and change creates, an acceleration of how technology can be used to healthcare providers and ultimately patients within the overall health system.  We start this year well prepared to deliver upon the objectives we shared with you in late November, and with a deep sense of responsibility to do so on behalf of the people we are privileged to serve. With that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. While the calendar shows we are two weeks into the New Year, our team's 2023 started many months ago; and in some cases, years ago. We have been laying the groundwork necessary to execute on our growth strategy and sustain our momentum heading into this year and beyond. To give you a sense of how this develops, I'll step through some of the work that has been longue dur\u00e9e to ready our organization to serve even more patients and customers in this new year and provide greater value for consumers across a broad range of initiatives. Take the many new patients we will serve under value-based care arrangements in 2023, deepening our presence in existing areas and adding new regions. Our team's preparations are extensive. That's because the transition to fully accountable care is not simply a matter of downloading a new app. The preparations include significant investments in clinical training, technology, network coordination and other activities to make certain we are ready to serve. These critical investments help us support both our current year needs and establish foundations for the growth into 2024 and beyond. Our ability to serve people effectively has expanded beyond the four-walls of the clinic with the rapid development of our in-home clinical capabilities. These services complement our clinic-based and digital offerings and bring high-quality care access to some of the most challenged and often underserved patients in this country. For instance, for value-based patients, our in-home services have reduced hospital visits by 15% versus fee-for-service, delivering comparable health outcomes and achieving an NPS of approximately 80.  Within health benefits, you've heard us discuss how our innovation in commercial products is adding new growth opportunities. One of those is Surest, a unique solution to employers and employees who are looking for first dollar coverage and high transparency into quality and cost. The momentum behind Surest is strong and building. Just two years ago, one in 25 national accounts offered Surest as an option to more traditional plans. Thus far in 2023, it is one in nine, and we expect it will continue to rise. Our offerings for seniors are another area in which we plan, invest and build capabilities to provide new and valuable offerings for an extended period. For example, we continue to expand the range of clinical services we provide via our HouseCalls initiative. In 2023, we will increase the types of vaccinations offered, expand testing services and deploy even more real-time resources to address social determinants of health. Seniors place high value on being able to get care in their home. It comes with an NPS of 75 and is helping to drive improving retention levels as we head into 2023. In addition, our advocacy service solutions help members achieve better health. Our solutions led to a 42% increase in closing gaps in care, up to 15% lower ER visits and an over 10% increase in clinical program enrollment compared to customers who utilize standard offerings. Turning to health technology, let me offer a few early observations on our progress and long-term growth opportunities we see in this area. With the completed change healthcare combination, we are accelerating our investments to bring this vision of a more intelligent and simpler health system to market as rapidly as possible. We will continue to innovate in and deliver the software, data analytics, technology-enabled services, revenue cycle management and advisory services our customers expect. And we are executing on the synergies of this combination with most of the financial benefit coming from complementary growth. OptumInsight is uniquely positioned to offer integrated, end-to-end technology analytics and services across the entire healthcare value chain. Along these lines, we recently reached two new comprehensive health system partnerships, with Northern Light Health in Maine and with Owensboro Health in Kentucky. The services we provide typically feature a full breadth of our advanced solutions, including information technology, revenue cycle management, analytics and supply chain tools. The key here is that our comprehensive technology solutions are resonating in the market, and we expect to see increasing momentum across all of OptumInsight as we invest in and finalize our integration activities. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. The investments and innovations Andrew and Dirk described and that we shared with you in November, speak to a company that has tremendous growth potential as we head into '23 and well beyond. The opportunities to serve people more deeply are tangible and accelerating, building upon a foundation of strong growth in recent years, including our 2022 performance. Revenue in '22 of $324 billion grew by more than $36 billion or 13% over the prior year, with well-balanced double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.34 grew 19% and brought full year adjusted earnings per share to $22.19, growth of 17%. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flow from operations in '22 was $26.2 billion or 1.3x net income. We returned $13 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, and deployed over $20 billion in growth capital to expand our capabilities for years to come. Turning to the performance of our businesses. OptumHealth's revenues grew by 32% in '22 to $71 billion as we expanded the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 1 million. Revenue per consumer grew by 29%, driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we are able to offer. Consistent with our comments in November, OptumHealth is off to a strong start in '23 and will organically grow to serve an additional 750,000 value-based patients this year. OptumInsights revenues grew 20% to $14.6 billion in '22. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $30 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion over last year. As Dirk noted, we are advancing our investments to more rapidly unlock the positive impact OptumInsight can have for care providers and patients. We expect to make a significant portion of these important investments in the first half of the year. Optum Rx revenues grew 9%, approaching $100 billion for the year, driven by continued strong sales and the expansion of our pharmacy services businesses. Both customer retention and new customer wins were among the highest Optum Rx has ever delivered, laying a strong foundation for continued market-leading growth. At UnitedHealthcare, full year revenues of nearly $250 billion grew 12%. Our strong 2023 Medicare Advantage member outlook is consistent with the objectives we shared with you in November. We expect to serve up to 900,000 more people in '23 across our individual, group and dual special needs offerings, our 8th consecutive year of above-market growth. This consistent performance underscores the product innovation, benefit stability and high-value seniors have come to rely on from us. Our Medicaid growth outlook for '23 incorporates an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations early in the second quarter. Our objective is to ensure that people will have continuous access to benefits. And when all redetermination activities are eventually completed, we expect to serve even more people than we do today across our state-based commercial and exchange-based offerings. Within our commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1 million additional people in 2023.  Our new and innovative products continue to gain momentum with employers and their employees, which will lead to increasing growth in this market over the next several years.  In sum, while this year is just getting started, the early performance we are seeing across our businesses further validates our confidence in the 2023 growth and performance objectives we shared with you just six weeks ago. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. As we head into 2023, we're determined to build upon the momentum we've just described this morning, further advancing our mission and delivering sustainable earnings growth of 13% to 16% over the long term. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice : The company seems to be taking a lot of momentum across the board into '23. I wonder when you step back and look at the swing factors that say would push the company towards the higher end of the range that you've offered in EPS or towards the lower end, what are some of the biggest swing factors in your mind, potential positives or challenges?\nAndrew Witty : A.J., thanks so much, and Happy New Year to you as well. I appreciate the question. Yes. So first off, we do feel that we're bringing a ton of momentum into 2023. We feel across the board last year, very strong performances. Most of our businesses closed out the year actually a little ahead of where we were anticipating even when we were at the investor conference. So strong from that perspective. As we look into this year, I think real standout for me maybe call out just two or three points. One is just the membership roles and just the scale of growth in our membership. If you look at UHC performance during '22, you heard us talk about that just now, we're anticipating, frankly, another 1 million plus. I wouldn't be at all surprised if we didn't exceed '22 numbers by the time we get to the end of '23. That is a huge plus and signals a tremendous amount of engagement from the marketplace in our product set across all lines of business, whether that's in the government books of business in the MA platform, our determination to make sure that we look after folks in Medicaid as they go through redetermination cycles and, of course, in our commercial books where you've seen tremendously strong growth. So that's really an area which I think is building for us a lot of confidence as we go forward. And then you go across to Optum, and let me just call out record selling seasons coming through from our Optum Rx platform. That's building a tremendous amount of pipeline growth for us within our business over the next several years. OptumHealth, of course, really rapid growth of value-based fully capitated lives. You'll see by the end of '23, we'll be looking after -- well, more than double the number of folks we were looking after at the end of '21. That's an extraordinary expansion, and we expect that to continue to grow hard. OptumInsight, this year will be an emergence of a new OptumInsight. That's a business where we know we can do better. We've known that for a long time. We've been itching to get going on the integration of change and OptumInsight, which we've now been able to do. We really leaned into that in the fourth quarter. You'll see that flow through very rapidly in the first couple of quarters of this year. That's going to give us a whole new cycle of product innovation. We expect that to be a big source of lift as we go forward, backed up by an increasing momentum of being able to sign up these very large health system partnerships. You've seen us do two since the investor conference in November in addition to the ones we already have. I remind you, these are very large scale, very sticky, multiyear relationships, really substantial sources of energy for the organization. So that really drives all of our momentum. I think where we land in the ranges we've given you is all about our ability to execute and making sure that our organization is focused on every single day, making sure we get every transaction right. We look after every patient in the right way. We make sure that we're looking after every consumer approach that we received in the right way. And so execution is going to be what determines where we come out. The raw material in terms of the momentum for the company is just extraordinary as we look into 2023.  A.J., I appreciate the question. And maybe next question, operator, please?\nOperator: Yes. The next question is from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill : Great. I was wondering if maybe you could just comment on the RADV expectations for February 1. We just had our conference this week, and there was a lot of talk about this and just what managed care is generally expecting out of that ruling?\nAndrew Witty : Lisa, thanks very much for the question. Yes. I mean, we're not going to get into a ton of speculation because obviously, it's very, very potentially imminent. And so not sure there's tons of value there. But I would like to ask Tim Noel looks after our M&R business to maybe share some of his perspective on that. Tim?\nTim Noel: Great. Thanks for the question, Lisa. We talked about this a bit at the investor conference and don't have a lot of new information to share this morning, but let me revisit a couple of the key elements that we discussed a couple of weeks ago. So first, risk adjustment is really critical to providing broad and equitable access inside the Medicare Advantage program. Also a really important part of ensuring there's no disincentives for caring for the most vulnerable. We also continue to remain very supportive of additional transparency. And here, that takes the form of more timely and consistent reviews. And a few of the key elements that we're thinking about with respect to these audits is it's very important for CMS to include a fee-for-service adjuster to make sure that we're comparing original Medicare and Medicare Advantage on the same basis. And also, very important that we don't conduct these audits decades in arrears. That comes with some challenges, of course. That said, without the final rule set, as Andrew alluded to, hard to get really narrow and specific, but we feel really good about how our results validated. Some of our sample sets were above, some of our sample sets were below. But likely more specifics to discuss at next quarter's call. Thanks, Lisa.\nAndrew Witty : Tim, thanks so much. And Lisa, thanks for the question. I mean I think as you just, again, just maybe step up a little bit in the broader position, obviously the whole MA program is unbelievably successful and popular program for seniors across the U.S. And of course, the biggest proof of that is the number of folks who every single year volunteer to sign up to be part of this program. And we're seeing another record year of enrollment coming through as we speak. It's super important that any changes, whether it's in this particular circumstance or any other circumstance, it's super important that folks are thoughtful about collateral consequences, making sure that what is really impressive program in terms of quality of care, reassurance provided to seniors, ability to deliver good value for the senior, good value for society, making sure that any changes are made thoughtfully and holistically is what we would be hoping to see. And obviously, we look forward to working with the administration when and if any further updates come forth.  With that, Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And let\u2019s go to next question, operator.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin : I was wondering if you could speak to the progression of earnings when you add physicians or large physician groups in OptumCare and how that changes over time. I'm specifically looking for sort of margin ranges as you first get started in the first year. When you break even, how long that takes? And then how long it takes to get to the ultimate margins? And I'm curious if the scale that you've got now, half of this book is new in the last three years, does scale accelerate some of that opportunity?\nAndrew Witty : Josh, listen, thanks so much for the question. It's a really -- that's a big question. Let me just give a few thoughts toward that. So one of the key capabilities you need to be in value-based care at scale is patients. Patients because it takes three or five years of getting to know medical practices before they become part of our network and as we go through our expansion. Patient then in terms of how you go through the process of building the capabilities and skills within the clinical practices to move from fee-for-service to value-based care. And of course, that patient size is reflected in how long it takes to go through this from an economic and financial perspective. And that's why as we see this rapid development now, it's kind of -- OptumCare, value-based care is kind of an overnight success that took 15 years to build. And that's -- it's really a truth. And we're seeing that scale now come to life and all credit to the teams who are doing that. In terms of what helps here, I think it's really building a muscle within your organization to continuously test, learn, correct, test, learn, correct in terms of how we work. This is a very -- so very -- it's a somewhat delicate system because what you're dealing with, obviously, highly professional clinical decision makers on the front line who are absolutely, ultimately responsible for every decision they make in front of every patient. But you're also trying to make sure they have the right information to be able to learn from the whole system, the information we know about those folks and what's likely to happen, what could happen, what might be the best practice. And how can we get the whole of the system to operate at a higher level. Those sorts of pieces of progress, those areas where we relentlessly invested, give us opportunities to improve the clinical care. If we can improve the clinical care, the economics follow. So within this whole model, getting the clinical care right, getting people in the right facilities, making sure people don't spend too long in care facilities when it's unnecessary, making sure that illness is delayed, deferred because they're treated well that prevention is the priority, that's what drives all of the economics. What we're seeing, Josh, is that over the last three or four years, we are indeed being able to bring our more recent cohorts to a better economic position more quickly. That's allowing us then to continue to invest more aggressively in bringing new patients into the system. And that -- it's really that mechanism, which you're seeing come to life at the moment. Hopefully, that helps a little bit. And next question please.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake : Wanted to touch on cost trend. MLR was in line with your expectations for the quarter. But wanted to hear -- there's been questions about the impact of respiratory in the quarter. There's even been some discussion around a pickup in just overall utilization in December. So would love some comments on those to it, maybe just a little on how trend looked between the different businesses, commercial, Medicare and Medicaid?\nAndrew Witty : Yes. Justin, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Brian Thompson to respond to that, please.\nBrian Thompson : Yes. Thanks, Justin, for that question. Throughout the pandemic, we've been making these references to baselines, et cetera. I think, now being three years into this pandemic, I'd like to just ground an anchor more to our expectations as COVID has waned. And what I'm most encouraged by is that the fourth quarter played out as we had expected. And what we had set out inside our pricing trends are lining up really nicely as we look forward to 2023. To your comments around the flu, as I had suggested at our investor conference, we certainly saw that spike. We have now seen that start to wane for, I think, five consecutive weeks here as we're moving forward. So to put it out like we had expected, really not a meaningful impact as I'm looking forward versus what we've planned for. So what I'm most encouraged by is we're sort of out of that zone of the unknowns around comparing to baselines, et cetera, and really managing a book of business with greater predictability back to sort of the expectations that we had well pre-pandemic and encouraged about how all of those elements, including flu, are lining up as we look forward. Thanks, Justin.\nAndrew Witty : Thanks so much, Brian. And Justin, thanks for the question. Next question please?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes : Yes. Could you talk a little bit about the employer segment? And what I'm interested in is what was pricing like in 2023? If you think of the 6% commercial trend that used to be your pre-pandemic sort of levels, what was that like? And for those employer customers, how are they kind of waiting the need to get employees in the war for talent versus focus on maybe higher premium costs and how they're trying to control that?\nAndrew Witty : Lance, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to kick off on that.\nBrian Thompson : Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll hand it off to Dan Kueter. I'll start with the conversation around trend. As you well know, we used to share trend information back in the day, and stopped doing so simply because it became less instructive as we were pacing through this COVID environment. What I can share, and I think once we get to this zone of consistency, we'll return to those metrics, we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing on the utilization front. I think we are seeing some durable shifts. We've seen it with respect to ER moving into urgent and in-patient to outpatient. But on the flip side, as we all know, in these labor markets, we're seeing stronger unit costs. And as we all know, unit costs still comprise the majority of the overall trend. And as I had suggested earlier in the year, we did have a higher trend planning for 2023 than 2022. But in reality, that was really a function of the first half of 2022. And again, I want to give that thought and belief that we are largely back to normal levels. And I think once we pace through 2023, we'll get to that zone where we can share those pricing trends. So with that, maybe a little bit more on the competitive dynamic, Dan.\nDan Kueter: Yes. Thanks, Brian, and thanks for the question, Lance. The competitive dynamics in the commercial market remain the same as they've been, always competitive. We continue to price to our forward trend, and we have continued to do that. As Brian indicated, there has been some modifications to that, but all within the range of what we've expected and all within the range of how we've priced. So we don't see any material deviations at all from what we've expected in our plan, so.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Dan. Thanks, Lance. Next question?\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley : In OptumHealth as you have added or about to add behavioral and home, more substantial home care opportunities and have talked about those in the context of value-based care. I'm wondering what influence those have on the trajectory of revenue per member served? That's already rising at a pretty rapid clip due to the full cap that you're transitioning lives into. So the home and behavioral adds to that.\nAndrew Witty : Yes. So I'm going to ask Dr. Wyatt Decker to make a couple of comments in a second on that. But maybe just before he does, and I think we don't particularly break out what's driving the elements of that kind of consumer served number. But you can imagine that the move to value-based care is a big driver of that. Now one of the pieces within the home platform, just to pick out one of the two areas you called out, David, is, of course, within there, you have a substantial amount of D-SNP population, right? So that particular part of the business helps us do a much better job of looking -- giving a much better end-to-end wraparound care for complex folks often found in the D-SNP population. And of course, they represent a different type of revenue profile compared to more of a community patient. So I just make that point. So within the home piece, it kind of a derivative phenomenon that home creates a capability, which allows us to serve D-SNP folks better. That, of course, is going to be an accelerator to the metric you were focused on. And maybe ask Wyatt to go a little deeper though, around how you're bringing behavioral along as well as home please?\nWyatt Decker : Yes. Well, thank you, David, for the question. And it's very timely. We view home health as one of the new frontiers of providing value-based healthcare because of the convenience it provides and the ability to access people, like dual special needs patients that often have very difficulty leaving their home to get care. So you will see us both developing if you will, the platform of home care increasingly in a comprehensive fashion, as well as integrating home care with our clinic-based care model. So it really creates two growth vehicles for us, if that makes sense. And similarly, with behavioral, as we've seen during the pandemic, the need for behavioral care is immense in the U.S. market. And our ability to embed behavioral healthcare services within our primary care and value-based care offerings has been differentiated and will continue to grow, as well as our utilization of virtual behavioral care solutions in both the home and clinic environments. And so we're pretty excited about how this is coming together, and we're creating a differentiated offering that helps accelerate value-based care growth and provide that comprehensive care that people made.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Wyatt. Next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor : Just looking for a couple of numbers. One, just going back to respiratory. Our recollection was maybe 4Q for you guys was about 30 basis points of MLR from respiratory. I know Brian said not meaningfully higher. So I'm assuming that means there is another 15 bps or 20 bps or something from respiratory this quarter. And then just secondly, on the investment gain, about $400 million above The Street, about a couple of hundred million above the '23 guidance run rate. So just wondering, was there a realized gain in that quarter that's kind of above recurring or how we should think about that number?\nAndrew Witty : Thanks so much, Gary. Let me ask John Rex to respond.\nJohn Rex : Gary, good morning. I will go back in order here. So just in terms of -- it\u2019d be very similar with Brian Thompson's commentary in terms of what we were seeing in the quarter and I think forward. So those -- that incidence was modestly elevated in the 4Q, but I'd call it modestly elevated, but very much in line with what we would have expected -- and when we were in front of you back at the end of November in terms of flu and respiratory. Let's put those two together in terms of just combining that whole view. So elevated, when you take it into materiality in terms of the $50 billion of medical costs in the quarter, I wouldn't call it immensely material, though, in that element, but very consistent. In terms of investment income, probably wouldn't be very similar to what we reported 4Q a year ago in terms of the absolute level of investment income in there. I wouldn't -- just kind of like last year, probably wouldn't use that as my run rate stepping out into next year though. So we're still comfortable with how we established and guided for 2023 from that perspective also. So very consistent with that 4Q of last year, too.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. And thank you, Gary. Next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : Just interested if you could summarize your key M&A priorities for 2023, and whether there's any sort of shift at all in sort of the key trends that we've seen over the last few years, which have been a big focus on adding the clinical capabilities and the scale at both OptumHealth and OptumInsight. Should we think about that continuing to be the core area of focus or any other additional elements that are worth considering?\nAndrew Witty : Thanks so much, Scott. Before I ask John Rex to make a couple of comments on this, I'll maybe just make a few introductory notions. I wouldn't go into a ton of detail about where we're looking, but I would continue to say we fully anticipate continuing to deploy our capital effectively into the marketplace. You know that a hallmark of this company has been its ability to effectively and efficiently utilizes capital to supplement its organic growth, and that's been a big part of the success of the organization. We'll continue to do that. We have a substantial number of transactions in process as we speak. As you well know, we're obviously in the process now of bringing to life the Change OptumInsight integration, which is super important for us. As we look forward, it's a very interesting marketplace. I mean I would say that John will probably confirm this, I think what we see the pipeline of opportunities we see is probably bigger, deeper, more diverse than we've ever seen. That's been a trend that kind of picked up probably early last year, certainly continued. We'd expect to see this year to be a pretty interesting year for us. And it's -- you know our five growth pillars. You wouldn't be at all surprised to expect us to obviously align our M&A capital investment around our growth pillars. Beyond that, I'm not sure it would be necessarily wise for us to go too much more detail. But certainly, John, I'd love you to give a bit more perspective on how you're seeing the landscape and the environment.\nJohn Rex : Absolutely. Scott, yes, so I'd start with just echoing what Andrew mentioned there, the way we approach this very much aligned with our five growth pillars and how we evaluate, how we look for opportunities, I should say, and where we think we should be pursuing investments and relationships. I'd point out that these are certainly very long-lived in terms of the investments that we make, in terms of relational investments we make, in terms of understanding markets, particularly as we've heard us talk about before within the care delivery businesses and such as value-based care that these are. Most of the markets that we want to address are aren't established the way that we would like them to be established, so it's very greenfield in terms of our approach to M&A as we look at marketplaces and bringing together the capabilities that we would pursue. The environment itself that echo what Andrew previewed there, certainly a strong environment in terms of opportunity sets that we are seeing in the broad marketplace, in terms of the types of capabilities that are there, how they might fit within this enterprise and the potential. I think you would expect us to see like where we've been focused. Certainly, over the last number of years, you've seen us do a lot of development as it relates to components of value-based care. And you know we define that very broadly now in terms of how we think about capabilities within value-based care to bring in new capabilities also and across all the other elements. But I\u2019d overall characterize the environment as strong and the opportunities as among some of the most interesting, I think, that we have seen as a company.\nAndrew Witty : Yes. I'd agree with that completely, John. And I certainly, over the next several years, see this part of the agenda being a key part of our continued support of our long-term growth goals, and you should expect to see us be -- continue to be active in the space. Thanks so much, Scott. Next question please?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter : I wanted to follow up on the home component of the value-based care opportunity. Wondering if you'd say potentially you're further along in the penetration with the home model inside the UHC book than other payers? Any color there would be great. And then, any sense of how the 4 million fully accountable lives break out by clinic versus home model with the primary care setting, or also how the 750,000 member growth breaks out for 2023 would be great?\nAndrew Witty : Stephen, thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me just reiterate how important we see the development of the home model, the home care platform, and we've seen that grow very substantially over the last couple of years in particular. Super important though, to recognize that it kind of -- so of course, sometimes folks can be essentially managed within just the home environment or the home care platform, and that certainly happens sometimes. But of course, what always happens, what very often happens is the clinic environment, the home environment are connected together, which is really what we're building here. So it's not super instructive, I think, to think about folks who are just kind of clinic nominated or home nominated. That can happen. But not really, I think, necessarily the right way to look at it. I wouldn't look at it that way. I'd see -- I really think about it the way we've built the home capabilities as a substantial extension of what we're able to do in the clinical space. And it speaks to the reality of care. People -- a lot -- not everything happens in the 20 minutes you're in the clinic, right? A ton of things happen when you're at home, and making sure that we've got care capabilities there, especially for folks who find it difficult to get out of the home or for whatever reason, find it difficult to engage with the system. That's a super important part of the environment. What I'd say is that, that is resonating super strongly, not just with UnitedHealthcare, but with other payers as well. And there's no doubt that this side of the agenda has caught the imagination of other payers, and we're delighted to see the continued extension of the multi-payer dynamic of OptumHealth and Optum more generally. And this is one of the drivers of that. In fact, during Q4, our external growth rate -- revenue growth rate was analogous to our internal growth, or i.e. Optum was growing just as quickly with non-UHC payers as it was with UHC. And that's a super important signal for the strength of the company. So important area, you'll continue to hear more about home as we go forward. But I would look at it more as a strengthening as a whole rather than a kind of separate stream in which we would be thinking about it that way.  Hopefully, that helps a little bit, Stephen. And let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich : The advance rate notice for '24 will be out in the coming weeks. It's clearly been well noted that the past few years have kind of been above the historical trend, and know that at some point we could see some moderation. I'd just be curious what your expectations are around that and how you view its relative importance in the context of your overall outlook for the MA market?\nAndrew Witty : Nathan, thanks so much. Yes, as you rightly say, obviously, we're getting close to when we would likely hear the rate notification. And obviously, we don't know what that's going to be. I think where we would sit is -- we think MA is an incredibly important program for seniors. I think it's been demonstrated now repeatedly the value that delivers to the individuals, the value it delivers to society. And of course, the way in which seniors are essentially voting to become part of this program just signals how effective it is. We believe that one of the key elements of that effectiveness that we certainly focused on is our ability to deliver stable benefits year in, year out. So I mean bottom line for us is we hope year in, year out, that the rate notice essentially facilitates that and it allows us to continue to deliver that stability. And we look forward to seeing what that will be, and we'll work with that once it's communicated to us. Not much more we can say on that, to be honest, until we obviously get the right notice. So thanks for the question. Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright : On Optum Rx, your near-term Optum Rx targets do imply passing on the savings from biosimilars, but can you detail some of the other levers you have here to drive the strength you're anticipating? How should we rank those drivers across pharmacy services, versus biosimilar benefits over the next, let's say, 12 to 18 months?\nAndrew Witty : Great question, Erin. Before I ask Heather to give you a few more details, I think we're super pleased with the progress we've made, particularly on the biosimilar innovation that's coming this year in the next few weeks. And the work that's been done within Optum Rx to deliver a contracting strategy, which ensures that everybody who wants to use a HUMIRA molecule, whether that's the brand or whether it's a biosimilar, gets access to lower cost right out of the gate has been a super important innovation in terms of our contracting strategy.  So without folks having to be shifted from drugs or dislocated in the marketplace, we found a way to bring lower cost to everybody in that environment. And I really want to give credit to Heather and her team for the work that she's done to lead on all of that. As you rightly say, we're passing those benefits directly back to the payers and the folks themselves. And with that, Heather, why don't you pick up and describe what else is driving the Rx growth this year?\nHeather Cianfrocco : Sure. So first, let me give you just another sense of maybe next phase when you think biosimilar and then let's hit the strength of the earnings for us in '23. So as Andrew said, we intended to set up the biosimilar strategy to allow the most value to pull through in year one that we can to clients, and we're proud of that. But this is a multiyear strategy, and the markets dynamic will continue to watch it. What's important here is creating a marketplace for competition of the originator with a biosimilar in the specific unique environment with HUMIRA and so many manufacturers coming to market. But over a period of maybe, say, the next 18 months with different attributes, our strategy allows them to compete based on their clinical criteria and product attributes, how the manufacturer support the product and then, obviously, the economics and the pricing. So that's the goal. We'll see that play out over the years. And the goal was to provide choice, not a lot of disruption and be able to extract value without restriction or exclusion. So we'll watch that play out. But when I think about the earnings and the strength of the position we're in or what we hoped to be by the end of '23, think of it as some of the stories you've heard us building and what we've been talking about for the last couple of years, and that's strengthen our pharmacy services. I'll give you an example. Yes, the community pharmacies are growing. They're expanding quickly. But our specialty pharmacies, our Frontier Therapies where we serve some of the more rare disease and orphan drugs are growing as quickly. And in many of those are getting scale. So for instance, the community pharmacies are scaling to the point where we're allowed -- we have central fill supporting because we have the volume of scripts going to those community pharmacies. And we're getting better with negotiations, we're able to negotiate harder on some of our procurement in those businesses. But also look at the PBM. You heard strong selling season again. We hope to have another strong selling season. The pricing is dynamic. We moved quickly with our pricing, with our product attributes. Our product adoption is up 40% year-over-year in our PBM products. And then we've got some return on some of the investments we made in the last year or two, Optum Frontier Therapies, our partnership with RVO. So that, I think, is when you look towards the next year, focus on those areas and look for us to drive earnings growth in those particular areas.\nAndrew Witty : Heather, well said. And again, you've seen a real transformation of the Optum Rx platform. If you look at five years ago, about 1/3 of the revenues in that business came from non-PBM pharmacy services. Now it's at half. As a tremendous shift on the business' scale, really is significant. And I'd say one of the key themes, which is driving a lot of that is a relentless shift was the consumer in the way in which that business is orientated and building its product. Real focus on delivering the best possible deal for consumers, making sure they get the lowest net cost. And then you'll see through, as Heather just mentioned, partnerships like RVO Health, you'll see us to continue to innovate the way in which we engage with consumers to make that much more modern, much more as U.S. consumers should get and should expect. Heather, thank you so much. Next question please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette : so regarding the acuity level of the elevated flu and respiratory costs in the fourth quarter, is there any sense for just how much of the elevated cost for, hate to call it, tripledemic, let's just call it that, I guess, for the quarter, how much of that was related to the hospital inpatient setting in particular? And then from your data, was there any sense that there may have been any slightly lower elective procedures or traditional non-COVID and non-flu-related care in the fourth quarter in light of the elevated flu and respiratory cost and utilization?\nAndrew Witty : Stephen, thanks so much for asking that. Listen, I think -- listen, of course, it was Q4. There was a bit more flu and respiratory. But really, I'd say immaterial in the scheme -- in the grand -- in the way I'd say in the grand scheme of the healthcare costs of the U.S., almost not noticeable. I mean, almost nothing to see. And I think I wouldn't -- much as I think there was a lot of anticipation around what could be coming in this notion of different viruses all come, somehow creating this, I think you said triple pandemic, really not there. And the little elevation we saw was somewhat within the ranges of what you typically would expect in a normal Q4 early flu season, which, as Brian mentioned earlier, looks like it's -- we've seen the last five weeks coming down. That's pretty much it, yes. So I really wouldn't guide you to characterize this as a big deal within the overall mix of the total healthcare costs that we're dealing with. It really isn't. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck : Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for redeterminations that you talked a bit about how you see that as a membership opportunity, but some more focus on the MLR implications. I guess, if you think about the potentially significant change in the membership of the Medicaid program and the implications for the risk pool there, how are you thinking about potential margin compression and how quickly rates might be able to reflect that, if it does play out?\nAndrew Witty : Kevin, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who looks after our Medicaid business to talk to that. And maybe Tim, as you do that, you could also maybe just allude a little bit on the degree of visibility you have for your book of business as you roll into 2023. That might also be helpful.\nTim Spilker : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. So certainly, a number of factors in play as we look ahead, certainly, the change in membership that we'll see as redeterminations resume. And then also acuity utilization, all of the factors really as things return to normal.  So at this point, from where we look, we've got visibility at around 75% of our revenue for the year. And states, as they set that revenue, have taken all of those factors into account when setting their rates, and that revenue is in line with our expectations and consistent with the outlook that we shared in November. So we're appreciative of the balanced rational view that our states have taken as they've looked ahead, knowing that we've got many factors coming forward. Maybe one last thing, just as we look ahead, the redetermination process will be extended. We know it will take 10 to 12 months depending on the state. And that will give us opportunities to provide data, feedback and insights to our customers, work with them to adjust as things develop. So really no changes from what we communicated in November and with a little bit more certainty now in terms of our revenue.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thank you, Tim. I appreciate that, Kevin. Thanks for the question. Operator, we just have time for one last question, if we could go ahead, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill : I wanted to come back to the specialty drug and pharmacy initiatives. And I guess, can you talk about what percent of these drugs are going through the mail channel versus the retail channel now? Kind of how do you expect the share to shift away from retail to mail? And then I'd tack on kind of how should we think about what the earnings power of the shifts can look like as you capture more of the specialty drugs in owned channels versus third-party channels?\nAndrew Witty : George, thanks so much for the question. Let me hand it straight to Heather, please.\nHeather Cianfrocco : Sure, great question. As we continue to see the pipeline in specialty drugs, I hope you can feel the urgency around us driving. And you can see it in our growth, but also in our patient care and our clinical program. So our Optum Frontier Therapy, I think, is actually a good model. I know it serves only sort of rare disease and orphan drug, but we talked about the investor conference. It's got a comprehensive clinical model wrapping around it that supports not just the patients, the caregivers, the prescriber, the family, but also helps pharma to deliver the best service in those drugs. That is the model we're using to inform how we serve clients and how we serve patients in our specialty business as well. So think about that holistic support, patient advocacy, patient support, caregiver support, prescriber support, all while investing in automation. So even in our pharmacy -- in our specialty pharmacy today, our automation is up. We're actually seeing over 30% higher self-service in the specialty pharmacy. That's not just mail and maintenance, that's specialty. So we're investing in the automation. For those that have simple transactions and want to interact with us with these, but those that need more comprehensive care with complex conditions that need the value of our 24/7 pharmacist support, our team is there to help them. So we will always continue to work with our retail partners. We are -- we've got a very strong network of that. But we want to be able to serve our consumers and our clients with best-in-class specialty service.\nAndrew Witty : Thanks, Heather. And George, thank you for the question. Listen, we come to the end of the call, I hope very much you leave the call with a sense of our optimism and focus on continued growth for the year ahead. We remain intent on expanding our ability to help improve healthcare at the system and individual levels and executing with excellence for all those we serve. We look forward to sharing our progress on this journey with you again in April. And in the meantime, thank you so much for your attention this morning. We appreciate it.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-14 12:44:03", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be followed in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 14, 2022, which maybe accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we approach the final stretch of 2022, let me start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare who continue to work diligently day in and day out for those we serve. Their efforts allow us to deliver durable and balanced growth and to increase our 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.85 to $22.05 per share. As an enterprise, we remain focused on our mission and on advancing our growth strategies. Our aim is to serve more people through value-based care and expanded health benefits offerings, a robust foundation on which to consistently drive strong growth into 2023 and beyond. Consumers want value, especially in the current economic environment and that means high-quality care that is more accessible, more affordable and more responsive to their individual needs. In the past quarter, we have accelerated efforts to deliver on this critical consumer proposition, launching several initiatives to reach more people in more communities while deepening relationships with those we already serve. For example, in September, we announced a long-term collaboration with Walmart to provide Optum technology and expertise that will enable America\u2019s largest retailer to provide value-based care to consumers in its clinics. Starting in 2023, we will jointly develop 15 Walmart health clinics in Florida and Georgia and will extend into additional geographies over time. As we expand the collaboration, there will be broad opportunities to address social determinants of health by improving access to benefits such as healthy foods, medications, dental and vision services and more. We also launched a distinctive partnership with Red Ventures, a digital media company connecting tens of millions of consumers each month to its clients\u2019 products and services, through a broad portfolio of proprietary digital content platforms. This partnership called RVO Health combines Red Ventures popular health and wellness platforms, including health line and health grades, with Optum\u2019s consumer marketplace, the Optum Store and the Optum Perks prescription discount card. RVO Health will enable us to engage with more than 100 million active monthly visitors seeking the health advice and insights they need introducing them to relevant products and services through a customized end-to-end digital platform. Affordability is an essential component of value in healthcare, especially when it determines access to the life-saving medicines people need for themselves and their families. In July, we announced zero consumer cost share on drugs for diabetes, severe allergic reactions and other emergency situations starting in January for those we serve with commercial insured benefits. Now, we are working with self-funded employers who are exploring how they can provide these vital medications for zero co-pay. So far, this benefit will be available to more than 1 million additional people and we are actively engaging with many additional employers. We are also improving access to essential medicines for those even without health benefits coverage. For example, Optum Store launched a new partnership with Sanofi to help consumers without insurance obtain insulin for $35 a month and they will be able to have it delivered to their home. Turning to health benefits, today, nearly half of American seniors are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans compared to about 25% a decade ago. And MA plays a vital role in serving those consumers who are significantly more diverse, have lower incomes and more complex care needs than the average senior. There are compelling reasons why seniors increasingly choose MA. Through Medicare Advantage, people are experiencing better health outcomes than in traditional fee-for-service Medicare across a wide spectrum of measures. For example, MA members with diabetes have over 50% lower rates of any category of complication and over 70% lower rates of serious complication. This is due to our ability to provide deeper, more coordinated levels of care, and this is accomplished at lower cost. People served by MA spend as much as 40% less compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. And this high value for people is delivered at a lower net cost to the government. We are confident our differentiated offerings will once again this year resonate with consumers who are even more focused on affordability, value and simplicity given the rising cost of daily life. Today, in the United States, more people than ever have access to health benefits, an important milestone on the path towards universal coverage, an objective we have long supported. Much of this expanded coverage has occurred in Medicaid. Looking to 2023 and given the potential resumption of eligibility redeterminations next year, a high priority for our team is assuring continuity of access and care for those we serve. The initiatives our team is pursuing to help assure continuous coverage include launching direct outreach and partnering with states and community organizations to identify those at risk and help them retain their benefit coverage, partnering with national retailers and pharmacies to educate consumers about available coverage options and assistance while they are shopping in store and engaging with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive education efforts to employees who are eligible for coverage. Underpinning our growing consumer agenda is an ambitious multiyear effort to deepen and expand our enterprise technology capabilities. The recent combination of OptumInsight and Change Healthcare reflects our accelerating efforts to help create more effective and simple experiences for consumers, payers and care providers while lowering costs across the health system. I want to formally welcome our newest colleagues, the talented and compassionate team at Change Healthcare, with whom we have just started working to build upon our shared vision for a more effective and adaptive health system for all participants. With that, I will turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. As Andrew just mentioned, we are very excited about the recent combination of Change Healthcare and OptumInsight. With a grand total of 11 days of integration work behind us, I thought I would provide a bit more commentary on how together we can make the health system simpler and more efficient. Overall, Change brings a robust transaction network built on strong payer and provider connectivity. Together, our focus areas include: first, improving the quality of health care delivery by offering critical point-of-care insights aligned to evidence-based medical standards within the workflow of physicians; second, simplifying administration by fully automating claims transactions, including editing in the EDI stream, improving claim accuracy; lastly, we are reducing friction in the payment process by providing patient benefits and payment obligations at point of service and applying payment integrity at its upfront. Our teams have started out of the gate working intensively together to make these visions a reality and to create the next era of growth for OptumInsight. We are very confident that our combined capabilities will enable us to better serve all healthcare constituents. Beyond OptumInsight, as you might imagine, I spend a lot of time engaging customers of all sizes, operating in almost every sector and representing diverse employee populations. Across these customers, no matter the person or the industry, I hear the same consistent message. The need for deeper levels of support and more resources to comprehensively meet health needs in both the traditional, but also increasingly focused on behavioral health. Companies want to provide a broader range of resources and deeper levels of support for their employees and their families and the groundwork we have been building is resonating in this rapidly evolving area. Here is what we are doing about it. First, we are tackling access. We have expanded our behavioral health network by 25% over the last couple of years, including a growing complement of behavioral clinical practices owned and operated by Optum. And as many of you know, behavioral health is a 24/7 challenge. So we are continuing to expand our portfolio of digital offerings supporting a range of needs, allowing patients to get resources when they need them. We have also made significant improvements to help consumers access vital information more easily through improved navigation tools, guiding consumers to the appropriate condition-specific level of behavioral health is a challenge we are prioritizing. These new experiences have improved customer satisfaction and we are getting people to the right care more quickly. Behavioral health plays an integral role of the overall health and well-being of the people we serve. So you will all continue to \u2013 so you will continue to see us increasing access, quality and affordability in this clinically important and sensitive area. Another tenet of our consumer focus is meeting people where they are, which includes expanding our clinical capabilities to care for people, more holistically, in their homes. We know that at home care settings, especially for people with mobility challenges and highly complex health needs can improve outcomes, elevate patient experience and result in better care. So we bring together teams with medical, behavioral and palliative experience in addition to our home infusion capabilities of OptumRx. By doing so, we help patients and their families keep multiple chronic conditions in check while significantly reducing the need for care in acute and post-acute settings, a real positive for them. The expanding clinical breadth and deepening integration of our value-based care offerings are moving us beyond the confiance of traditional clinical settings, creating an opportunity for us to serve more people more effectively. With that, now I will turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. As those of you listening know well, numbers can tell a story and the story our numbers tell is one of broad-based growth and substantial near and long-term potential. So, let me walk through some of those numbers with you. In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group revenues of $81 billion grew 12% or $8.6 billion, highlighted by broad-based double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Care patterns in the quarter remained similar to those of the second quarter and our planning for next year anticipates care patterns continue to normalize. We are encouraged to see people obtaining preventive screenings at levels broadly consistent with longer term norms. And we are maintaining our focus on getting people the care they need. And acuity patterns remain stable, but as always, we are highly respectful of and watchful for evolving medical cost trends. Looking now at the performance of our specific businesses. OptumHealth\u2019s third quarter revenue increased 34% year-over-year as revenue per consumer grew 31%. Growth continues to be led by the increasing number of patients served under value-based care relationships and the expanding types of care settings offered by Optum from meeting behavioral needs to comprehensively serving people in their homes, to higher acuity ambulatory surgery. OptumInsight\u2019s revenue grew 18% in the quarter, led by continued market growth across payer and provider services. And the revenue backlog increased by $1.8 billion year-over-year to $24.1 billion. OptumRx revenue grew 8%, reflecting growth in people served and continued expansion of the pharmacy care businesses, including specialty, home delivery and community pharmacies. Pharmacy care services revenue growth continues to show momentum growing double-digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. And new customer sales and retention have been strong. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, revenue grew by 11% with all businesses contributing. The number of people served domestically by our commercial insured offerings increased by more than 100,000 over the past half year as we continue to experience strong growth in our newer, more affordable consumer-centric offerings. Products such as Surest, which provides consumers with greater certainty and choice over their health benefits and also our virtual first health offerings. People served by our Medicare Advantage offerings continue to grow strongly, increasing 800,000 so far this year. The recently released 2024 plan year star ratings were consistent with our long-term planning expectations, with 81% of our members in 4-star or better plans, a level we expect will rise as planned refinements are finalized. UnitedHealthcare enters 2023 and serving more people in 4 and 5-star plans than any other health plan. The number of people we serve through our Medicaid offerings has grown by 350,000 year-to-date. Most recently, we were awarded the opportunity to continue to serve the people of Nebraska in TANF, CHIP and long-term care programs. UnitedHealthcare achieved the highest score both overall and in each of the individual categories, reflecting our ability to deliver differentiated solutions aligned to our state customers\u2019 needs. And we continue to see strength in our dual special needs offerings with exceptional consumer satisfaction, demonstrated by a net promoter score of 80. Our capital capacities remain strong. Year-to-date, adjusted cash flows from operations were $21 billion or 1.3x net income. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38%, providing ample ability to continue to further build upon vital capabilities, which benefit both the people we serve and the broader health system. And we have returned $10.5 billion to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year through dividends and share repurchases. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance this morning, we updated our 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.85 to $22.05 per share. So we think these numbers are telling the story of an enterprise striving to conclude a strong 2022, a year broadly featuring diversified growth today and making foundational investments for our long-term future. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. As is customary with the close of a third quarter, we will offer early observations about next year. While reserving most of this conversation for our November 29 investor conference. Our businesses are growing and operating well with strong momentum and a keen enterprise focus on executing on our strategic growth priorities. Among a few highlights. The OptumHealth care delivery businesses are rapidly advancing their value-based capacities, expanding the scope and settings of care offered and creating a long runway for growth. And we see our innovative and consistently highly valued Medicare Advantage plans as well positioned to grow strongly again next year. At this distance, we view a majority of the 2023 analyst estimates as reasonably reflecting performance levels we would expect to offer in November with the current consensus at the top end of our likely initial earnings outlook range. And as you have come to expect, we continue to strive toward our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth goal. We look forward to discussing this with you in much greater detail in person at our investor conference in New York. I hope you\u2019re getting a sense of an organization that has long been the case is focused sharply on executing with excellence in all we do, so that we can meet and exceed our commitments to our customers, clinicians, consumers and the communities we serve and, of course, to our employees and to you, our shareholders. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions, one per caller please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will first hear from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the comments. As you think about \u201823 and you\u2019re going through the process of pricing discussions with your commercial employer groups and so forth. Is the basic concept \u2013 I know, John, you said continue to return to normal utilization. Is the basic view is that we would project a medical cost trend off of this year that\u2019s more in that traditional 4% or 5% range mid-single digits. And we\u2019ve heard some discussion about maybe there being an unusual bump up in addition to the medical \u2013 traditional medical cost trend to allocate something for providers dealing with their labor issues. Is your discussion with employers, is that something you\u2019re seeing getting put in place?\nAndrew Witty: So A.J., thanks so much for the question. And obviously, a key aspect of planning for next year that you\u2019re focused on. Just let me make a couple of broader comments and I might just ask Brian Thompson to reflect a little bit more detail on that as well from the UnitedHealthcare perspective. Obviously, for the last couple of years, there has been a lot of focus on the effect of COVID as you think about impacts on medical cost trend. I think as we\u2019ve rolled through this year, honestly, I think it\u2019s become much less about COVID. There is now I think there is a blend of possibly a little bit of COVID effect in the system, but cost of living effects, things like inflation, things like capacity constraints in the system as the labor market tightness has affected different parts of the system at different moments. So I think this whole issue has become actually more complicated in some ways because there is more influences on what you need to think through going forward. With that maybe sort of high-level perspective, maybe, Brian, you might just go a little deeper in terms of how you\u2019ve been translating some of that as you\u2019ve been thoughtful about pricing going forward.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, Andrew. Thank you, and thank you for the question, A.J. Brian Thompson here. As we do look forward, I would say that we have planned and price for our cost trend a little higher than historical norms. And I think to some of the points that Andrew made, some of them are pretty obvious and inevitable. The first just being the reality that 2022 is a lower starting point. In addition to that, contributing is labor and inflationary costs. And just being respectful of what we don\u2019t know, again, probably the pacing of care patterns and how they return to normal, certainly included in that. I would certainly suggest though at the same time, we\u2019re working really hard to manage down the impact of these trends on both our consumers and employers alike. And you mentioned how we\u2019re negotiating with our provider partners. I would say we\u2019ve really seen emergence of value-based arrangements at a faster pace than perhaps historically. So we\u2019re not just seeing unit costs accelerate at a higher rate. And in addition, just more product designs that are meaningfully lowering those price points for end consumers, whether it\u2019s virtually enriched products, we mentioned that a little bit. We\u2019ve talked a lot about surest and how that consumer choice model is really driving not only a lower price point. But first dollar coverage is really emerging as a priority for those folks that we support and serve every day. So those are some elements and dynamics not only in the product side, but how we\u2019re looking to our forward view of costs.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Brian, thanks so much. And I think, A.J., one of the key points, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have taken away from what Brian is saying there is, look, there is a degree of \u2013 there is some unavoidable pressures in the macro environment that everybody is well aware of but we\u2019re really doing something about that on behalf of our members and our clients and our customers. Our focus is to bring innovation into the marketplace, whether that\u2019s through the way we design plans like surest in UnitedHealthcare, the way we develop the value-based platform in OptumCare, all of which are designed develop to deliver high-quality care at more affordable levels for folks and then to ensure that, that is something that can rely on year after year after year. So a stability of confidence in the healthcare that they can come to expect. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re really viewing this. It\u2019s obviously a dynamic environment, but we\u2019re extremely focused, as you can tell, on making sure we have strong responses to it. Thanks, A.J. And next question please.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you refresh us on the components of OptumHealth and sort of how much of that revenue is now coming from OptumCare? And then how many of those consumers are within OptumHealth or actually OptumCare consumers and maybe how many are in some form of risk arrangement and then how many are full capitation? I think you\u2019ve given some of those numbers just looking for a refresh.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Josh, good to hear your voice, and thanks so much for the question. So a very good, very strong quarter, continued strong performance from OptumHealth overall. I\u2019ll pass in a second to Dr. Wyatt Decker to give you a little more flavor on that. Just let me pick out one of those aspects, which is a question you asked about the fully capitated lives within there. So if you think about OptumCare, obviously, a subset of OptumHealth has about 20 million or so folks who we look after through that platform. Probably, you\u2019re still a little under 15% of that number in fully capitation arrangements. So that really tells you \u2013 despite the very strong impact that\u2019s having, you can see the way that\u2019s reflected through this sustain 34% growth in average revenue per consumer served in OptumHealth. A lot of that is influenced by the capitation shift, but it\u2019s still a really small fraction of the total number of lives that we look after in that part of our organization. So a lot of runway there, and that\u2019s what really underpins our long-term confidence in sustained growth, particularly in OptumCare, which is a key piece of OptumHealth and maybe now pass to Wyatt to give you a little bit more context of how it all fits together. Wyatt?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thank you, Josh, for the question. Absolutely correct is the importance of capitated and value-based care to both our strategic business model to continue to offer comprehensive healthcare solutions to our nation citizens as well as to our optimistic outlook on growth. Today, over two-thirds of our revenue are derived from value-based care constructs, and that will continue to grow. As Andrew pointed out, we have ample pathways for growth. You\u2019ll see us going deeper and broader in the markets that we serve today as well as going into new markets like the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast. And what I am excited about is increasingly \u2013 we\u2019re bringing together the platforms that we have talked about historically and that Dirk touched on today. So think of home and community is helping us bring value-based constructs to a broader set of populations and servicing more comprehensively those we serve in OptumCare. So you\u2019ll hear me talking a lot about OptumHealth and our capitated and value-based risk labs because increasingly, we\u2019re bringing all of the services, behavioral, virtual, financial as well as clinics to bear to grow our value-based population. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Wyatt. Josh thanks so much. Next question please, April.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think non-COVID utilization has been running a bit below baseline this year, but you mentioned kind of care pattern is continuing to normalize. How are you thinking about that concept of normalization for both the fourth quarter? And can you maybe just talk about the factors that you think could have the biggest impact on the recovery in non-COVID utilization volumes as we get into next year?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Listen, Nathan, thanks for the question. As I said a little earlier, I think a good way to think about this is what has historically been a COVID narrative becomes much more a blended narrative around things like capacity constraints in the system, the cost-of-living folks\u2019 ability to \u2013 or desire to access the system right now, which is an area we are working super hard to try and ensure is sustained. Plus, of course, volatility in things like COVID and flu, particularly as you go through Q4, Q1 over the next few months. So I think all of that is essentially in the mix. We\u2019re taking, I think, a reasonably balanced view of how this is going to play out. We\u2019ve seen now for the bulk of this year, a reasonably stable pattern of care utilization across the portfolio. We are taking a normal year view for flu. So we\u2019re not particularly staking ourselves out to say flu is either going to be very low, as we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years, all very high. We just don\u2019t know. There is really no evidence to support any decision at this point in time. So we\u2019ve taken a very balanced view as we look forward into flu, which, as you well know, can affect Q4 or Q1 differentially year-to-year. And that\u2019s essentially how we\u2019re tackling all of this. We feel very confident about the way we\u2019re planning for the next quarter and particularly as we roll into next year. And obviously, we will course correct as things like flu reveal themselves to us. Thanks for the question. Next question.\nOperator: Justin Lake, Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of membership questions. First, I would love to hear your thoughts on the potential for what happens with Medicaid membership in your mind post redeterminations kind of starting? And then any kind of early view on Medicare Advantage, given the open enrollment kicked in here, what do you think for 2023 in terms of the market? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Justin. So I\u2019ll ask Tim Spilker and then Tim Noel to comment in a second. Just a couple of kind of introductory thoughts really on your questions, as I said in my prepared comments at the beginning of the call, Justin, redeterminations is a really important potential issue for next year and is something that, as an organization, we are going to \u2013 we are really leaning into. We\u2019re very focused on, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re concerned that through a redetermination cycle during \u201823 and \u201824, depending on when the public health emergency comes to an end, could lead to a situation where folks get dislodged from their coverage. And that would be a huge setback in terms of the progress that\u2019s been made over the last many years to extend cover. So we are really focused on how we can ensure that people are retained coverage. Tim will talk in a second around some of the ways in which we feel confident we can help but it is a really important area, and it\u2019s an area where we hope the entire industry and its participants all lean in to make sure that people don\u2019t get lost in the system as things go through a redetermination cycle. So that\u2019s going to be a super important area. Let me ask Tim Spilker to go a little deeper on that and then pass straight to Noel to talk about open enrollment. Go ahead.\nTim Spilker: Yes. Thanks for the question. So first, maybe just some of the numbers, so we\u2019re assuming the PHE will end in January and redeterminations will resume in Q1. And we will share more detail in November around the specifics, but we\u2019re very respectful of a variety of factors that are in play. Certainly, the pacing that will vary by state and then, of course, how consumers respond and behave in terms of the change. So as Andrew mentioned, we\u2019re working hard with our customers. This will be a big lift for states, a really long-term effort over the course of 12 to 14 months. So we\u2019re trying to do our part through data sharing, through outreach to consumers, engaging communities, engaging providers and then really connecting with individuals where they access care, so places like pharmacies. So we\u2019re proud of that work, and we\u2019re proud of our ability to be able to support members as they go through this change. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Tim.\nTim Noel: Yes, good morning. Justin thanks for the question. Tim Noel here. So first, if I may start just with kind of an end cap on 2022, John mentioned in the opening remarks that right now, we\u2019ve grown about 800,000 Medicare lives and that\u2019s consistent with the guidance we gave at our investor conference last year and we are on pace to end this year \u201822 with full year growth of 900,000 lives. So feel good about the way our value proposition has resonated in \u201822 and feel like that momentum will head into 2023. So, great feedback from the broker community around our product positioning, how we are investing, our emphasis on investments in the most utilized benefits like drugs and like dental benefits. So, feel very good heading into AEP tomorrow. With respect to the industry, over the long-term basis, we have kind of guided to 8% to 9% Medicare Advantage industry growth. I don\u2019t have any reason to see it differently from this vantage point for 2023. And once again, I like my chances to outperform the industry in \u201823 and have share gaining growth.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Tim. Next question please.\nOperator: Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Wanted to ask about OptumInsight, as you work to grow this business and add new anchor partners, I would love to hear what you are hearing from your health system customers given the challenges they are facing. How is the pipeline developing? Can you remind us, I guess how much revenue coverage you have for next year at this point? And then just lastly, any update on expectations for change accretion post the divestiture of claims expense. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Hi Stephen, thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Dan Schumacher to respond to the first part of that question, and then John Rex will pick up the point on the change accretion piece. So Dan, go ahead.\nDan Schumacher: Sure. Thank you, Stephen. Appreciate the question. Obviously, health system partners are under a lot of pressure. And we talked about some of them from the macroeconomic backdrop in terms of shifting side of care and labor shortages, wage inflation, things like that. So, as we engage with the market, we find that health systems are very responsive because we present an opportunity to be able to address some of those short-term needs, but then really importantly, on the mid to long-term, we become a key accelerant in some of their transformation initiatives, things like their preparedness for value-based care as an example, or how they engage digitally with patients. And so those are some of the areas that we have been expanding our reach. We have a robust pipeline, and that pipeline has been growing and conversations have been advancing. And what\u2019s been really encouraging is from our existing relationships, we have been able to drive really strong outcomes, and that gives us confidence around the performance. And so we are excited to see how that develops over time and that will continue to be a contributor. In terms of \u2013 our backlog, it represents about a quarter of our backlog and not surprisingly less in terms of current revenue contribution. And as it relates to coverage into next year, we have well north of half coverage on revenue as we look into next year.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Dan. John?\nJohn Rex: Yes. On accretion for change, so yes, it will be accretive next year. In terms of the magnitude of that, really, the important factors and considerations are when it closes within the year, certain expectations in terms of the integration costs that we will \u2013 and investments we will like to make in the business and when we get that done earlier in the year versus later in the year for a close and then what it has in terms of impact on the out year an important consideration as we bring that in, I think a full out year view. Also, as I am sure you are very aware, the divestiture that occurred in terms of \u2013 with the closing also having an impact on the magnitude of that. So, two important things there. Maybe just actually knowing that you have got models to do here also and as you think about it, 4Q and how that might play in the 4Q. So, we wouldn\u2019t expect a change to be additive to OptumInsight\u2019s operating earnings in the fourth quarter. A few elements on that. One, the second half for changes. I know you understand well, is it\u2019s lower half seasonally in terms of earnings. First half typically considerably stronger than the second half. So, the impact there and how that comes in. Clearly, there will be transaction costs that we will be incurring here. So, really, as you think about your modeling purposes, roughly in the zone of $800 million of revenue coming in to the OptumInsight segment without any impact on operating earnings. And of course, coming back on my comments is how we think about impact going forward. We will look to the point \u2013 to the extent possible, do any acceleration on other important integration activities. So, we can bring the potential benefits of the combination of OptumInsight and change to the health system more quickly, could see that potentially in the over $100 million in terms of incremental cost that we might look to do and pull that ahead. But all of that is incorporated in the 2020 \u2013 in the outlook that we provided this morning, the \u201822 outlook and our \u201823 observations also. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And I think John tees up a really important point that I just want to reemphasize, which is within the guidance we have given you today for the closeout of \u201822 and \u201823, not only are we anticipating obviously continued very strong growth in revenues and the consequential flow through the business. But you are also seeing us create the space to make sure we can make the right investments. So, whether that\u2019s in making sure we get the integration of change done as promptly as we can, whether it\u2019s how we invest in our consumer capabilities, which really started to get going in Q3 and will continue through Q4 and beyond or whether it\u2019s increasing our investment in our employees to make sure that we are responsive to the cost of living pressures. So, really important that you see that and very much taken into consideration as we thought through our work going forward. The other thing I would just also add is that I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I think you all understand how important the change integration is for OptumInsight. This is \u2013 it\u2019s a great moment to bring together tremendous complementary skills, capabilities, technologies, perspectives on the marketplace. And so as we roll through the next two quarters or three quarters, we really anticipate a kind of new OptumInsight emerging from this integration. And we are very excited to have Neil de Crescenzo as well as Dan Schumacher working together to lead these two organizations as this work goes on. So, a lot of energy potentially being released in this space. And as John said, we have incorporated into our guidance points the space to potentially make the right investments going forward. Next question?\nOperator: Scott Fidel of Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I know that continuity of care has been a big focus here, especially with redeterminations coming back. And just interested in that context how you are thinking about potential footprint expansions in the ACA exchanges for 2023 and beyond. It looks like also there has been some favorable policy developments and then some competitive changes to that could be positive for the market. So, just interested in your thinking on exchange strategy for both next year and longer term. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: I really appreciate that question. As you know, this is an area where we have been building up very substantially over the last couple or 3 years and maybe ask Brian to give you a little bit more detail on that.\nBrian Thompson: Sure Andrew. Thanks for the question, Scott. And we agree totally. We see the exchanges is really emerging as a meaningful place and a broader coverage criteria across this country. And it\u2019s certainly important to us to be more relevant each and every year. In fact, while we are expanding into four new states in 2023, our footprint is expanding meaningfully. I think we are going from around 40% of the addressable market here, leaving 2022 to nearly two-thirds by the end of next year and again \u2013 or by the start of next year, I should suggest. So, again, reasons aligned with yours. It\u2019s important that we are where folks are. And as we manage through this redetermination process working not only with our employer partners or distribution partners in our states, but making sure we have product ourselves to make sure that these folks can get enrolled in. And we are encouraged by our progress. We like how we are positioned here, leaving 2022 both from a footprint and receptivity and growth and a performance perspective and looking forward to expanding again in \u201823.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Brian. Thank you for that question. Next question please.\nOperator: Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I want to go back to trend, again, if I can. Can you give a little more color in the quarter about how trends looked across the three different payers? And when you talk about normalization in 2023, should we expect all three of them to be kind of back to normal, or do you have a view that the government, which has been lagging a little bit, will still kind of take a little bit longer to get back to normal. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Maybe I will ask Brian to make a couple of comments on that.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Hi. Thanks for the question, Kevin. Maybe I will start with service type, and it\u2019s really a focus on inpatient, that has been the driver, and it really was the driver last quarter as well. So, when I look at third quarter, it\u2019s largely a repeat of what we saw in the second quarter. Beyond inpatient, some variation, I would say, all other service types to largely near at or even slightly above normal levels. To your question, though, on lines of business, I might just suggest other than inpatient commercial, pretty much at normal care patterns. Medicare is seeing some interesting developments. I would say maybe signs of more durable shifts inside of service, particularly urgent care is a little lower, excuse me, a little higher, but ER is a little lower, and that\u2019s certainly a good trade for the system overall. Outpatient surgeries in Medicare seem to be back to normal. But again, as I had mentioned, inpatient a little bit lower. And again, Medicaid, consistent with the other lines of business, lower in inpatient and physicians starting to trend back. So, again, that\u2019s largely a repeat of what I had suggested last quarter inpatient really being the most notable element inside it.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much, and thank you for the question Kevin. Next question please.\nOperator: Next we have from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much for taking my question. When we think about membership in the commercial market, I am just curious how employers are currently talking to you about that trend going into \u201823. And if you can just give us an update on your thoughts around if we move into a recessionary type of environment what that could mean for the health plan business?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And I will pass that actually to our new Head of ENI, our commercial insurance business, Dan Keuter. Dan, would you like to answer that?\nDan Keuter: Yes. Thanks Andrew for the introduction. And Lisa thanks for the question. As you know, at this point in the year, our national accounts business for 2023 is largely resolved, but the other segments of our business are not resolved. As we look at that national accounts performance, we are very pleased with what we have seen in terms of a very strong renewal year and also a strong sales year, which leaves us I am confident in a growth year for national accounts for 2023. The other lines of the business are yet to resolve. Specifically related to your question about recessionary impacts, we are certainly well aware of those. However, I would note at this point, based on our Q3 performance, we have seen net hiring among our customers. So, we have not yet seen an emergence of recessionary impact in our commercial book of business. Looking forward to 2023, we will assess the continued evolving economic situation and provide additional guidance as that becomes more clear. Thanks for your question, Lisa.\nAndrew Witty: Dan, thank you very much for that and Lisa, thank you for the question. So, last question, please, operator.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our final question for today will come from Gary Taylor of Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. I just want to come back to \u201823 for a moment. I think the current Street consensus is about 13% earnings growth off your updated \u201822 guidance. And I was hoping maybe this would be a year where you wouldn\u2019t have to say initially that look to be at the high end of the initial range. And obviously, I understand guidance has often come up over the course of the year. But when I think about \u201823, I just want to make sure I am capturing what you are saying. You talked about redeterminations. You talked about some incremental investments in consumer and employees. And you also talked about, I think, just sort of healthy respect, as you might call it, for maybe utilization continuing to normalize. Could you rank those for us in terms of how you are thinking those headwinds weigh on \u201823 a little bit? Is there anything else you would say is material enough to add to that list?\nAndrew Witty: Gary, thanks so much for the questions. I mean if you kind of just think about the blend of headwinds, tailwinds for 2023, in terms of headwinds, I would probably say the external environment, the inflationary pressures, obviously, in among that mix. Question on whether or not we see any kind of economic slowdown as you just heard, we are not really seeing that yet in terms of our marketplace, but we have got to be thoughtful about that, and we want to make sure that we go into the year, not assuming anything overly optimistic. It would be great to have pleasant surprises on that dimension, of course, utilization levels, I spent a lot of time on this call talking about that as we start to see that continue to normalize. And then the investments, I mean those are really the four areas of investments in our business and you recited those very nicely. Now on the other side, you think about the tailwinds for the business. Very strong income and momentum for the organization. OptumHealth\u2019s growth in patients served, the evolution of the at-home platform, which has got over the last 2.5 years, 3 years, has moved to a very significant scale, complementing our clinic platform, strong capabilities that we are demonstrating in Medicare Advantage. You look at those really driving tailwinds for the organization, very substantial. The scale of those organizations and what we are able to do very material. And then I would also say our ability to continue to deploy capital effectively in the marketplace is another one of the things to really think about. And it\u2019s interesting, actually, just to pause for a second today and contrast where we are today versus where we were a year ago. So, year-to-date 2021, we have deployed about $5 billion of capital in M&A, which was about the full year number in the end. As of today, we have spent $20 billion in 2022. So, in terms of our ramp-up of capital deployment, and you heard from John Rex earlier, we have very substantial continued capacity. And obviously, the marketplace is getting interesting around that space. We have talked several times to you in the past about the diverse pipeline of opportunities that we see probably as diverse as we have ever seen. Very much opportunities we see across a number of our key growth platforms. And as we all know, the market is beginning to be very discriminating in terms of value. So, we will see how that plays out for us, but I think you have to expect that to be a tailwind for us as well going into next year. With that, Gary, thanks so much for the question. And thanks, everybody, for your time and questions today. We do hope you are taking away the impression of a company confident in its opportunities and ability to grow. Deeply aware of where and how we need to continue to build and improve and fully committed to our mission of helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. I want to thank you for your attention and we look forward to meeting many of you in person in New York later in the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-15 11:53:10", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under the U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial and Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 15, 2022, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Katy, thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. UnitedHealth Group ended the second half of the year with sustained momentum as we execute on our objective to serve more people more effectively with connected high-quality care. For that, I want to thank our 360,000 colleagues. It's their unwavering commitment to our mission and their hard work and support of the people we serve that makes all of this possible. As a result of the strong performance at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Comprehensive value-based care is a central theme of our growth strategy, helping more patients and care providers transition from traditional fee-for-service to a value-based orientation. We aim to drive better and more consistent care outcomes at lower overall cost, often for people who are among society's most vulnerable with multiple chronic conditions, limited income and unmet social needs. Optum Health and Optum Rx's clinical platforms span a continuum of care settings, from virtual to post-acute, in-clinic and at home, enabling our care teams to meet patients' unique needs by providing personalized connected care. Our approach helps patients stick with their prescribed care programs, allowing them to spend more time in the comfort of their own homes. The high consumer satisfaction with this comprehensive and consumer-focused approach is evidenced, for example, by a Net Promoter Score of 80 for the 1.5 million people served by our Dual Special Needs Plans. We again delivered growth across our health benefits offerings this quarter. As you might expect, right now, our Medicare teams are finalizing offerings for this fall's open enrollment, focused, as always, on delivering more value, stability and predictability for seniors. Throughout the year, we gather extensive consumer broker and market feedback to continually improve our products. Our approach is grounded in providing deep customer engagement, high-touch service and access to the best care. The benefits of this approach are striking. People served by Medicare Advantage spend about 40% less out of pocket than those participating in fee-for-service, which translates into savings of about $2,000 each year for seniors, most of whom are on limited income. And compared to traditional fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage plans devote up to 30% more in resources to primary care and perform up to 50% more preventative screening and testing services for their seniors. The response among seniors in our plans is positive. Plan satisfaction ratings have risen by 450 basis points over the past 5 years, nearly twice that of the industry. Consumer satisfaction is best demonstrated by the almost 3.4 million additional seniors who have chosen our plans over the same period. Meanwhile, in our domestic commercial health business -- benefits business, over the past 12 months, we have grown to serve over 250,000 more people as a result of innovation in and expansion of our products, including our digital-first offerings. To continue driving affordability in areas of greatest need, we are announcing today an important initiative from UnitedHealthcare, supported by Optum Rx. Starting in 2023, there will be no co-pay, $0 out of pocket for several critical medicines on our preferred drug list for UnitedHealthcare Group fully insured members. Included are medicines such as insulin, epinephrine for severe allergic reactions, and albuterol for acute asthma attacks. While this is an important step for vulnerable people's health, the larger and longer-term cost containment of drugs depends upon manufacturers restraining and lowering the list price of their products, which is a fundamental driver of costs. We will continue to use our capabilities to do everything we can to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, building on past actions, including point-of-sale discounts. Stepping back and looking across each of our 5 growth areas, you'll see a common theme: The deepening of our relationships with the consumers served by Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Throughout 2022, we've been rapidly expanding and accelerating investments in capabilities to reach and serve a broader base of consumers ever more effectively. This includes further enhancing our digital experiences to help consumers find trusted, health-related information and drive greater engagement with our direct-to-consumer platforms. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to share more about these efforts. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. Picking up on Andrew's comments, I want to provide you with a little more color on the progress we have been making on our growth strategies. This progress is evidenced by -- is evidenced in our work to serve more people through value-based arrangements and to deliver better care. We are well along in our goals for the year. This expansion has significant implications for clinical quality and consistency. MA patients in value-based arrangements with Optum Care physicians are more engaged in their care, with adherence to wellness checks running 5 points higher than Medicare fee-for-service patients, helping to deliver a nearly 20% lower hospitalization rate. Further, Optum Care COPD patients served in our value-based arrangements have 80% higher medication adherence rates than Medicare fee-for-service patients, contributing to about 60% fewer respiratory complications, enabling people to avoid emergency room visits. Clinical results like these are a small part of the track record we have built in delivering value-based care at a substantial scale for years now, and what gives real urgency to our work to expand access to such care. We also remain committed as an organization to improving access by driving down the cost of healthcare through applied technology. For example, we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance the technology backbone of healthcare. Areas such as platform rationalization to reduce unnecessary complexities, greater end-to-end eligibility management for a more seamless customer experience, and a common platform to facilitate a consistent clinical experience for our consumers and providers. These investments will ultimately lead to an enhanced end-to-end service experience, lower overall operating cost and greater value for people we serve. A simpler experience is at the center of our work on the integrated consumer card developed by our Optum financial services team. We have seen great consumer response within our initial pilot groups. The simplicity of combining all benefits, even healthy food purchases onto a single widely-accepted card has been a differentiator with consumers. Based on this initial work, we intend to introduce the card to all our individual Medicare Advantage members in 2023. Another key element of our work to improve experience is the optimization of consumer transactions. We know members need and expect timely information at their fingertips, and I'm pleased to report they are responding well to our digital offerings for everything from understanding their coverage to completing a virtual visit. Digital engagement has jumped 170% among Medicare members during the last couple of years. Lastly, in pharmacy services, we are very focused on improving quality of care and access for consumers by driving pharmacist-led offerings. We are on track to have nearly 700 community pharmacies by the end of the year and continue to increase the integrated community pharmacy footprint in our clinical locations. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. As Andrew noted, we entered the second half of this year with strong growth momentum. First half revenues of over $160 billion grew 13% compared to last year. Performance was well balanced, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. To begin, let me touch briefly on the care patterns we have observed so far this year. Principally, we have seen what had been a balanced relationship between COVID and non-COVID care activity over the past couple of years diverge modestly, with the latter not returning quite as rapidly with lower levels of COVID care. We also continue to see some variation in underlying care patterns, with certain areas remaining below historical levels. For example, pediatrics and emergency department. And others coming back more fully, such as the levels at which seniors are obtaining important preventative care. In recent weeks, we are seeing rising COVID-related hospital admissions but with a lower average length of stay compared with earlier periods. As always, we watch closely for longer-term health impacts on people due to care, which might have been deferred during earlier periods. Thus far, we are still not seeing patterns, which indicate shifting acuity. There are, of course, many reasonable theories about what is driving the current environment, and they are all no doubt interesting. But here is what we are actually doing. Consistent with the long-standing practice at UnitedHealth Group, our primary intent is to ensure people are getting the care they need and to help them in that process as much as we can. We remain, as always, highly respectful of medical cost trends and how they can evolve rapidly, and we will continue to position our offerings accordingly. Moving now to the businesses. Optum Health revenue grew by over $4 billion or 32% in the second quarter. Revenue per consumer increased 30%, led by growth in patients served under value-based arrangements. Earnings from operations rose 24% even as we accelerated investments in our care delivery practices to support value-based expansions. We also saw strong contributions from Optum's ambulatory surgery centers, which continue to advance the scope and complexity of procedures performed in these optimal settings, all while delivering a superior patient and surgeon experience and high-quality clinical outcomes. Our centers have nearly tripled the number of high-acuity joint, spine and cardiovascular procedures performed compared to just 2 years ago. Care providers increasingly recognize the benefits these centers offer, and consumers place high value on the care quality and experience, with an NPS consistently in excess of 90. Optum Insight revenue grew 11% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $23.6 billion, growth of $2.3 billion compared to last year. We continue to drive technological advancements, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning more deeply in high-value knowledge-based services, including an expanding suite of information technology and data analytics offerings. Optum Rx revenues grew 10% to nearly $25 billion, reflecting continued strong sales results and execution in the core PBM as well as our growth in our pharmacy care services. These vital and expanding care offerings serve and improve the health of people, including in such areas as our high-touch specialty services where we tightly monitor and track the effectiveness of complex treatments. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue grew by a strong $6.6 billion or 12%, with contributions from all our businesses. In our offerings for seniors, we continue to expect to serve up to 800,000 additional people within Medicare Advantage this year. About 3/4 will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in Dual Special Needs Plans. This puts us on track for our seventh consecutive year of share gaining growth in Medicare Advantage. People served by our Medicaid offerings grew by 180,000 in the second quarter. At this point, we anticipate the impact to Medicaid enrollment as a result of state redetermination activities will be experienced next year. We continue to prepare resources to help people find uninterrupted access to appropriate coverage as this transition occurs. We added 80,000 new people in domestic commercial plans during the quarter. Within that, fully-insured commercial offerings grew by 60,000 from the first quarter of this year, with balanced growth across group and individual fully-insured offerings. Of note, some 90% of the growth within our individual and family plans was among people who chose a plan featuring convenient and cost-effective access to virtual visits. Our capital capacities remain strong. Second quarter cash flows from operations were $6.9 billion or 1.3x net income, and we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion. In the first half of this year, we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. In June, our Board increased the dividend by 14%, and we deployed more than $7 billion in capital to enhance our care delivery capacity and consumer strategies to improve outcomes and experiences for the people we serve and for the benefit of the broader health system. As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today, we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $21.40 to $21.90 per share. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Before the Q&A, let me underscore a few key points. First, the strong momentum throughout our business. The people we serve are continually seeking value, high-quality care at fair cost, and our colleagues across Optum and UnitedHealthcare are raising the bar every day. You see that manifested in our business performance and the strong growth in our core platforms, double-digit growth across the Benefits businesses, a growing revenue backlog in Optum Insight, robust growth in our pharmacy services and expansion across Optum Health. We see tremendous opportunity ahead, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective and further advance our mission to help people live healthier lives and to help make the health system work better for everyone. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator:  We'll take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice : I wondered if maybe we could ask you to comment a little bit more on your discussions with the employer groups as we go through the selling season on the benefits business. I have 2 open questions. It seems like to me there's this sort of back and forth about need to retain employees, a tight labor market in many industries. But alternatively, concerns about the recession, and how is that coloring conversations? And then also this issue of pressure on some of the provider areas from their tight labor markets, how is that impacting discussions with employers about their benefit outlook for next year?\nAndrew Witty : A.J., thanks so much for the question. So first off, before I hand this to Brian Thompson to give you a few thoughts, we've been super pleased with the progression, particularly across the benefits business, as you've seen in the report this morning. But certainly within our E&I business, the commercial business had a very strong year. And I think the team have worked extremely hard to understand the kind of pressures you're describing as employers are obviously concerned about managing their own cost environment and how we make sure that the benefits availability for their employees are appropriate. Really, I would say, take just this opportunity just to emphasize how important the role of a company like UnitedHealthcare is here. Because as we all know, we're in a more inflationary environment. The role of UnitedHealthcare to help deliver affordability, affordable healthcare coverage to the employees of all of those companies that rely on it is super important. And maybe with that, I'll hand it to Brian to give you a little bit more sense of how things are playing out.\nBrian Thompson : Yes. Thanks for the question, A.J., and I appreciate that lead in, Andrew. Most of these conversations have been around innovation and how do we continue to drive value-based solutions in the form of product design. That has really been the central theme throughout. We have showed up to the market with some new ideas around virtual care. You've heard about that with our partnership with Optum, both in terms of product design, as well as broader access beyond medical integrated with behavioral, et cetera, and how we really enable the consumer. High deductibles have - often have been a part of the equation for a long time, but Bind really puts that consumer in the driver's seat where they're able to choose what coverage they want with pre-service guaranteed costs. And that really resonates in the marketplace. And most importantly, for employers, it not only provides great quality, but lower price points. So I would say the conversations have been less around staffing and employment levels and more around value. And these examples of products have really resonated.\nAndrew Witty : Brian, thanks so much. And A.J., thank you again. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. A question on cost trend. One, it'd be great if you could just run us through what you were seeing by business segment? And then two, in terms of thinking into next year, one, are you starting to price for some level of COVID kind of being normal? So I know you've always guided above for normal plus COVID. Are you starting to price that COVID in pricing above normal for next year? And two, what are hospital unit costs looking like for next year versus the 4% to 5% that we typically take in terms of new contracts? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty : Justin, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask John to maybe comment a little bit on the business cost evolution and then Brian, I think will give you a little bit of perspective of what they're seeing in terms of hospital conversation, just a couple of step back observations maybe I would offer here. First off, as we look across the overall business, we are seeing tremendous growth opportunities and tremendous potential for us to invest behind those. And you see that picked up in some of the increase in investment levels that you see in the quarter this time around. I think that's an incredibly positive sign of the forward potential of the overall organization. John will talk a little bit more to some of those in a second. I think in terms of 2023, we are not going to get into a ton of detail on how we are thinking about pricing. But as always, we are very, very respectful of the kind of underlying phenomena within the cost trends of the environment. Of course, that includes a sense of where COVID may or may not be. And I think we have all learned to be deeply respectful of something like a pandemic and the uncertainties it can present. And even in the last few months we have seen that play out a little bit. And of course, respectful of things like inflationary trends in the environment and all of that plays into how we think about these things. Maybe just to give you a little bit more depth on the first part of your question, I'll pass it to John, and then maybe John, you could pass it to Brian, just to finish off on the second part.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Good morning, Justin. Just a few thoughts, and in particular, maybe we will look at some of the observations really from the quarter from the first half and what we have seen because this influences really what you are getting at and asking how our thinking is developing. So, you heard in my prepared comments talked about that we typically seeing a very balanced relationship between COVID care and non-COVID care over the course of the last two years, and that's what shifted a little bit here in recent months that the lower level of COVID care. And let's put that in the second quarter, probably about 1/3, the number of inpatient admissions as compared to the first quarter. It was not as quickly accompanied by a higher level of non-COVID utilization. So, that was an important kind of underlying factor here that we saw in recent months. I think the other important thing here is, and as you look across care broadly, we've gone longer really between intervals and COVID hospitalizations that any other point since the pandemic now. So that further illuminates the core underlying non-COVID care patterns that we are seeing also. So helping illuminate what's going on underneath all of that. I think the other point that I wanted to speak to that we are seeing, we've been very encouraged that we are seeing some pockets of care moving towards more normal levels. Ones that we would say are kind of bellwethers for future care, an important -- for example, super important for us. Annual wellness visits among our Medicare patients, they're back at pre-pandemic baseline. That's very important for us in getting them the care they need. First fill prescriptions are trending above baseline a little bit, so we're seeing people get some care they need. We're seeing important pickups in some preventative care such as colonoscopies, also those now getting back to baseline. So all that kind of influencing in terms of how we think about the future. We got to make sure people are getting the care that they need. We've seen the greatest response really in our senior populations. I think some of that is our ability to get into their homes to influence that care and to get them into that. And certainly, back to your kind of core fundamental in how we think about the future, yes, enormously respectful of the outlook for future impacts from COVID hospitalizations. Here we are sitting in a period where we're seeing COVID hospitalizations rise again after kind of pausing since January. So super respectful in our outlook towards how that might progress throughout this year and next, and the potential for that to continue to be somewhat variable and to accelerate again. Brian?\nBrian Thompson : Yes, John, I think you summarized that well. I might just add on inflation. Obviously, as you well know, Justin, we priced to our forward view of cost, that includes inflation. We're certainly respectful of what we're seeing in terms of labor cost with our provider partners. And as you might expect, obviously, with long-term agreements, there will be more impact in 2023 than 2022, just as a function of time and how we renew these contracts. So certainly respectful of that dynamic and environment. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Justin. Appreciate it. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser : Yes. I'll focus on Optum Rx. So when we look at Optum Rx, clearly, you've seen very strong top line and growth and membership growth, but we haven't seen necessarily the flow-through on the margins. So what kind of like trends are you seeing just in terms of mix that have impacted results? And how should we think about the progression for the rest of the year for Optum -- for Optum Rx?\nAndrew Witty : Ricky, yes, great. Ricky, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Heather to make a few comments on that, I think one of the overwhelming census that we see around Optum Rx is the really strong growth and the bringing on board of very significant new clients. And of course, that, as you know, brings with it a kind of front-loading investment phenomenon as you gear up for supporting that, and that's one of the reasons why you see this lag between the revenue growth and the earnings growth. And maybe to give you a little bit more of a sense of all of that and other aspects, Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Yes. Thanks. So as Andrew said, really strong growth this year, and you see that as a result of new client growth and the membership that we've brought in and the direct Optum Rx as well as the UnitedHealthcare book. And you're seeing that in the revenue, you're seeing that in the scripts volume, we see strong utilization, and you also we're seeing that in the earnings growth. With respect to investments, which do impact margins in the quarter, but we will see a return on those through the year and in our long-term plan, I point you to actually 4 things. Number one, those client investments that Andrew talked about. Number two, we talked to you about the new businesses. We've referenced Genoa that we continue to expand into new sites so we can serve more individuals in underserved communities. But I'd maybe point you to 2 additional ones that I think provide some great context where we're investing for the year. That's, number one, with our existing clients and even being responsive to those or prospective clients in our PBM, it's moving very urgently with innovation, like Brian's seeing on the UnitedHealthcare side. To develop products today that address specialty drug costs that are high and rising in addition to consumer affordability. Building on the tools that we've already, I think, delivered significant value. Our specialty tools has delivered over $1 billion of value over the last 2.5 years, and we're not done. We're working urgently to bring more services and products. So that's happening real time in the quarter, and those investments will pay off. And then the last one I'd point you to are those -- are our pharmacies. So our pharmacies are fast growing. We're seeing that impacting our top line growth and in our earnings. But you'll see us not just invest in our operations, and we've talked to you about that before, and in our digital experience. But I'm most excited about the fact that we're also integrating the service. So putting the pharmacist first. We have over 7,000 pharmacists that work hard every day not just to serve and sync meds, but to help our individuals navigate, educate and guide people through our best-in-class capabilities. And so really, integrating those pharmacies with the pharmacist-first and a service-first model is one of our biggest investments in the quarter, and you're going to see a return on that through the rest of the year, but I think it's also going to pay off in the growth of those pharmacies and better service to individuals that need us most.\nAndrew Witty : Great. Thanks, Heather, and Ricky, thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatt Borsch : Yes. If I could ask a question about the -- I think it was about a month ago that the U.S. Supreme Court elected not to take up the case that had gone through the district and appellate courts regarding the CMS rule on risk coding, if I'm referring to it in the right way. Can you just help us understand anything you can say about implications, or at least maybe next steps in that process?\nAndrew Witty : Matt, thanks very much for the question. I mean, I think not to be too disappointing too, but I don't think you'd be too surprised that we don't generally comment on ongoing legal processes. And I think in this case, that certainly applies. So not really in a position to be able to give you too much information on that, but certainly appreciate the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : Just had a question just around the LHCG pending acquisition. And clearly, just recently, CMS put out their Home Health Proposal for 2023 and with a pretty disappointing rate cut that they're proposing for next year. Just interested in how that rate cut may influence your thinking on the financial impact of the LHCG acquisition in 2023? And then also whether that influences how you think about deploying that asset potentially in different ways if CMS does end up going through with the rate cut in the final rates when they release those?\nAndrew Witty : Scott, thanks so much for the question. And listen, let me start off by saying we really believe that enhancing and building high-quality care provision in the home is going to be a key feature of the future. And the more that that can be linked to other aspects of care, so for example, physician clinic, virtual and the rest, it's very much a central focus of our Optum Health development. And so the bringing together of LHC within the overall Optum organization is really important to us, and we're very committed to that transaction. We believe it really is going to be a significant enhancement of the quality of care that can be delivered. And we think we can really -- it can really contribute towards improved value-based delivery for patients. I think, as is always the case, making sure that the incentive system is appropriate to drive the right kind of care is really important. So I hope very much over time that CMS and others continue to see the value of home care and that, in fact, the support is given and the signals are given to continue to increase the development of high-quality care in the home environment. And so we'll see how that plays out. Honestly, we are committed to this agenda very much because we see it as a strategically critical way of extending better care to folks in homes. And you have to remember, Scott, some of these folks can't get out of their homes. I mean, this is really -- this isn't kind of elective for them. They need -- we need to find ways to get more help to them. And as you know, we've got a long history in this in areas like house calls, which have delivered amazing health assessment and preventive direction to millions of people, and this is another big step for us to extend. So we're optimistic about this. We hope very much that CMS and others will continue to send signals of support through the way in which they choose to invest in this arena, and we'll see how that plays out during the rest of the year. Thanks so much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill : Andrew, I appreciate your comments on Optum Rx and what you're doing for 2023 around the no co-pay, $0 co-pay. But I'm wondering if you or Heather could maybe comment on 2 things. One, the 2023 selling season? And then secondly, I know you and I have talked in the past about shift towards value-based care within Rx. Are you seeing new programs for 2023 beyond what you talked about as we think about value-based care?\nAndrew Witty : Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And I think UHC supported by Optum Rx are doing the completely right thing here to bring $0 co-pay and $0 out of pocket on some critical meds. And you've got to think about the consequences of folks who are unfortunately affected by the conditions that these meds address. If they don't get the meds when they need them, they're going to end up in the emergency room or worse. And that brings with enormous personal human consequence and, of course, cost. And so we believe this is a really appropriate place for us to lean in and to address that. In terms of -- before I go to Heather to talk about specifically Optum Rx selling season, I just want to step back for a second. I just want to let you know, Optum is in the middle of a record selling season across the board. If you look at the first 6 months of Optum, it, of course, including Optum Rx, but also the other 2 businesses, that we are in a record selling season. So this is a really significant period for us in terms of the fit of the products and services that we're offering across the marketplace. One of the reasons why you've seen a step up our investment profile in the business is because we're seeing such a strong pickup in our services. And maybe with that, Heather, you could address specifically what you're seeing in Optum Rx as you think about selling seasons into '23? And maybe also just touch on the value-based care aspect that Lisa described.\nHeather Cianfrocco : Absolutely. As Andrew said, strong selling season across Optum Rx is enjoying that as well. And the way I think about that, first of all, it came off a really strong '22 season. Sitting where we are today, 2 ways to think about it. The first is client retention. We're going to be in the high 90s again this year with most of the book in right now. With respect to new business activity, based on sales activity, including finalists and win rates right now, we're ahead of where we were at this time last year. And I really think that's the result of the real-time innovation. We're working again with our clients now to bring them services today. We're not waiting. We're not waiting for other market factors or the environment to make us innovate and drive down cost, and that's showing up. I think we have the best client management team and responsive client management team in the industry, and that's paying off for us. So I think we're going to be very busy again in 2023. That's going to require some investment. But we're going to be very busy with another 2023 year serving our clients. With respect to value based, I guess, I think about it in 2 respects. We're seeing better -- we're seeing definitely more interest and pressure from our clients. And we're also seeing more engagement from our clients to engage in the elements of value-based care and to incorporate pharmacy, including specialty pharmacy, into those constructs. The role for us to play is, number one, to ensure that our pharma partners are bringing the most affordable value-based and clinically appropriate drugs to drive those results. But the other thing is that we bring tools real time that integrate products, with treatment protocols. We work very closely with Optum Health, and particularly with most -- with many of our Optum Care prescribers and providers, to experiment with these tools and services that will help prescribers make the right choices. Our plans and plan sponsors to be able to have more predictability in their services and for us, to be an important piece of that value-based shift. So you'll continue to see us invest there, and I think we'll see even more -- the PBMs being a bigger piece of driving value-based care and integrating pharmacy.\nAndrew Witty : Heather, thanks so much. And Lisa, I think you're really right to focus us on this value-based piece. And as Heather just said, rather than it being an Optum Rx kind of standalone agenda, it's very much an Optum agenda, right, in terms of how we build value-based care propositions. And of course, you've seen that very substantially within -- in the primary care, kind of holistic approach that Optum Health is leading on. You'll continue to see us prospect experiment and invest in areas like behavioral health and in areas like oncology, and these are going to be important areas for us to solve. Right now, I'd say those are early day opportunities. But as you think about where the burden of cost and complexity sits in the healthcare environment, those are the kind of places where we need to make progress, and we are. And you should expect to hear much more from us on that over the next 2 or 3 years. Lisa, thanks so much. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin : As you look at the senior market over the next couple of years beyond the obvious primary care services that you're building out, are there other capabilities that you think you need to develop or acquire things that are now emerging in the market that you think are going to be even more important in the future?\nAndrew Witty : Yes, Josh, great question. Really appreciate it. And we continue to see a very strong performance in our senior book of business. You see that continued progression toward 800,000 folks joining us this year for the first time. That's really important, continued market share growth. And all of that is built on the stability of the service offering that we're giving. And I think the experience that the seniors are taking. But you're totally right to ask the question about where next. And maybe Tim Noel, you could speak to that?\nTim Noel : Hey, good morning, Josh.  selling season for Medicare Advantage. Throughout the selling season  number and also seeing, as John talked about, really great engagement. I think about senior market  continuous agenda of innovation is super important  Dirk talked about the UCARD, which is something that makes our benefits easier to use, more simple for members to understand on and experience. But beyond that, we'll continue to bring forth consistent innovations that make the member experience easier for people. Things like the digital experience, more personalized member experiences as well. I think another theme for the senior population will continue to be to -- on expand at-home services. That's really important. I think we've historically thought of the center of care for seniors to be in the physician's office. More and more, though, that's becoming something that needs to occur out of the home given mobility channels, challenges for folks, the vulnerability of this population, bringing care into the home is absolutely essential to the delivery of high-quality care. So those are the big themes. For me, looking forward is continue to advance the at-home capabilities for seniors and continue to innovate, make using benefits easier, more understandable, simple, affordable.\nAndrew Witty : Tim, thanks so much. And I think maybe there was a little glitch with Tim's mic at the beginning of his comments. So I hope very much you were able to hear him, and certainly hear the latter part of his commentary. And I think the sense of urgency and depth of thinking around innovation for our senior members and where that service can go over the next several years is really substantive, and you should continue to see us be super active in that space. Josh, I really appreciate the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck : Great. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the capitated physician growth in the quarter. How you think about the ability to continue to add doctors at this rate, the competitive landscape? And how should we think about where the margin and the capitated physician business compared to Optum Health broadly and where that segment could go over time?\nAndrew Witty : Great questions, Kevin. I'm going to ask John in a second to talk to the margin progression opportunity. But maybe first, Dr. Decker, Head of Optum Health, might speak to the whole dynamic around physician recruitment?\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Kevin, thanks for the question. Absolutely, we are seeing continued growth of our physicians in Optum Health and Optum Care. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found is that physicians are increasingly attracted to the value proposition that we offer them, which is less clerical burden and more focused on doing the work that they love, which is providing clinical care. Moving physicians to value-based care paradigms is especially appealing. So you're seeing us appeal to large groups like Atrius and Kelsey that have recently joined Optum Health, as well as doctors coming straight out of residency. So we're tracking nicely towards our growth agenda of adding 10,000 physicians and advanced practitioners during the year, and look forward to following up with you at the investor conference to share those numbers.\nJohn Rex : Good morning, Kevin, it's John here. So considering the growth in Optum Health and the earnings progression that you should expect out of that, the primary focus continues to be on expanding our capabilities for value-based care, that build out. These investments, as you know well because you've looked at this for a while, are made well in advance of any revenue impact that we get from bringing those physicians on. As we look at our pipeline, so when I talk pipeline, there are 2 ways to think about it. It's both potential future ads. But when I'm talking about it now with you here, I'm talking about even our existing base of clinical care delivery capabilities and where we have to build out that capability in terms of future value-based expansion. We're still quite early stage in that, which is why we hang in this 8% to 10% margin range for Optum Health, view being here that there is a decade ahead of build for us, so. And just when you look at our existing pipeline and what that can drive in terms of strong double-digit top line growth for many years as we bring this on. And the importance, in particular because of the value it brings to the patients we serve, of continuing to invest in these value-based capabilities. So as we build along this, you'll see as we try to do this, we try to -- we look to deliver in this 8% to 10% margin range. And I expect that to continue just because of these deep investments and still considering this very early innings, third inning in terms of the build that we'd like to see looking ahead for care delivery.\nAndrew Witty : John, thank you very much. Kevin, I appreciate the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Whit Mayo with SVB Securities.\nWhit Mayo: I would have thought that investment income would have been a little higher this quarter. Were there any write-downs on Optum Ventures, anything that would negatively impact that? Just wondering how you're marking some of those investments that you've made in recent years.\nAndrew Witty : Yes. Well, thanks so much. Let me hand it straight to John.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Whit. Yes, within the quarter, we actually took -- we realized some losses as we reposition the portfolio a bit here, looking out to the future, try to get that all teed up for the environment we're in right now. And so when you look at that, the quarterly progression, which I believe that's what you're focusing on, I'd call it some of the realized losses we chose to take in this quarter.\nAndrew Witty : Thanks, John, and thanks, Whit. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen and Company.\nGary Taylor : I just wanted to follow up on the Kelsey-Seybold and Atrius commentary just a little bit. You spent just under $6 billion on acquisitions this quarter, which is about what you've spent annually each of the last 5 years. So just wondering, given the size of that, if you could give us any more color on kind of where those organizations are fee-for-service versus capitation? How they might impact Optum Health margins in the second half? And then just broadly on the environment, are the valuations that you're able to garner still far below public company value-based care valuations even after they've corrected? Or is there anything there that becomes more intriguing?\nAndrew Witty : So I'll ask John to make a few comments on this in a second, but I'm glad you saw that substantial continued deployment of our capital to grow the business. As you know, a key part of our long-term growth strategy is, of course, organic and complemented by bringing on board new businesses and teams who can supplement what we have. And there's nothing more powerful to that agenda than building out the value-based care piece. Now we believe in both Atrius and Kelsey-Seybold organizations. We have amazing teams, people, organizations which have got real character, history, personality of themselves that we think is going to really add to the diversity of the company and bringing with it a tremendous amount of skills and perspective. And as you know, a number of them already -- in both cases, they have developed themselves some significant thinking around value-based care, so the fit is really good. Of course, when you bring in new organizations, there's typically a further in process before they fully contribute, and I'm sure that will be the case here as well. But really, we continue to be extremely active in how we sensibly think about deploying capital, and we remain very optimistic about our ability to do that. But maybe go a little further around valuation perspective, John?\nJohn Rex: Yes. As it relates to valuation perspective, I mean, our pipeline and our conversations as we expand in care delivery, these are multiyear conversations that we have. Often by the time we are able to partner with another care delivery organization, we've probably been in conversations with them for 5 years. Super long pipelines, development processes, relationships, understanding the organization. That is us understanding their organization, them understanding us. These go on for quite a long period of time. So with that perspective there, there's probably a little bit less volatility than you might expect in terms of as we pace out and we think about valuations in this business and where we would have stepped into it maybe a number of years ago where we are now. And even if you look towards a public market and such, this just don't manifest quite as quickly. But they also kind of on the other side, they weren't manifesting as quickly. So I would call it a little less impactful at this point and juncture, but the key point that I think we focused on is, these have been multiyear conversations and relationship builds for us as we move into these, and typically not a 6-month process.\nAndrew Witty : Absolutely. Gary, thank you so much for the question. We just have time for one last question. So final question, please, operator.\nOperator: We'll go to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich : I wanted to ask on utilization in the current inflationary environment that consumers are facing. If, given the greater consumerization of healthcare in today's market, how do you think consumers might change how they utilize the system given some of the pressures that they're facing? And have you seen any signs of changes in behavior so far?\nAndrew Witty : Nate, thanks so much for the question. I'm maybe going to go to Brian in a couple of minutes just to give you a little bit of what he's seeing and what is kind of reflected in his membership. But listen, obviously, we all see the inflationary pressures around us, and we all know that that has -- that really focuses people's minds on how they prioritize their spend and investment. What it really means for us is we have to double down on getting a great deal for them. We have to use our capabilities to get the very best quality care available at the most affordable cost. And whether that's through the PBM, whether that's through the UnitedHealthcare negotiations with the rest of the medical environment. That's a really important role we're stepping into play, and we're going to continue to lean into that very much. Now then, it speaks to really being astute around understanding how within the consumer experience, some things are more problematic than others. And I'll call out one of the things we're announcing today to eliminate those co-pays on for people who are in really vulnerable situation. This is the right time to do that, to help those folks who are struggling, and we know that we need those folks to make sure they fill their prescriptions properly. And if there's anything caused by the inflationary environment that might hold that back, there's going to be really bad downside there. And we don't want that to happen. So we will lean into that. I'd call out things like virtual, call out things as you think about much more digital engagement. Call out choice. I mean, giving consumers more choice. The more pressure there is in the environment, you've got to lean into it. And that's why, as an organization, we have over the last 2 years really doubled down on our commitment to consumer strategy across the board. Core capability of this company going forward will be consumer capability. And that's an area where you will see us continue to talk about, invest in, build, innovate and we hope really lead in terms of moving the consumer to the center of thinking in healthcare. And maybe just to finish off, Brian, would love to get your perspective on what you're seeing from your very significant membership.\nBrian Thompson : Sure. Thanks for that, Andrew. Maybe to put it in 2 zones. Macro, I think Andrew hit it right in that macro environment. It's really around virtual care and around emergency department use. We've seen, obviously, virtual care increase and emergency department use go down. As I think in the particular, again, back to that concept of consumer and choice, it's around product design, Bind being our best example when we can put that consumer in the driver's seat where they can choose site of service and optimize both their cost and quality, they do. And when you couple that with a high-performing network, obviously, you get the benefit both of the unit cost as well as that consumer choice. So those are the greatest examples that I can see really emerging in this environment.\nAndrew Witty : Thanks so much. And Nate, thank you very, very much for that question.\nAndrew Witty: We certainly appreciate your time and attention today. And I hope what you heard is the story of growth and focused execution. As our strategy continues to generate momentum across our businesses and advance our mission on behalf of every person and every community, we're privileged to serve. Really grateful for your attention this morning. Thank you so much for your questions. We look forward to following up as usual with any further questions you might have offline. Thanks so much, and have a great day.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-14 10:18:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts, a recorrelation of the non-GAAP to the GAAP amounts available on the financial and earnings report section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning in our Form 8-K dated April 14, 2022, which will be assessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to Chief Executive Officer of the UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Coming into this quarter, we set clear objectives for the year to drive strong execution of our long-term strategy and deliver high-quality diversified growth, pursue excellence in every consumer experience and at every touch point and apply technology to help all stakeholders to improve access, affordability, outcomes and experiences. As our results show, we're delivering on these objectives. I would like to start this morning's call by thanking my colleagues, the 350,000 people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Their dedicated work gives us the confidence today to increase our 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $21.20 to $21.70 per share. At our November investor conference, we described five key areas to drive our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth rate. In the first area, value-based care delivery. OptumHealth continued its robust momentum into the first quarter, characterized by its integrated approach and high clinical quality. After a strong start to the year, we now expect to add 600,000 patients under value-based arrangements during 2022 compared to our initial estimate of $500,000. Our approach focuses on providing quality care in the setting that makes most sense for the patients we serve. Our pending combination with LHC Group will reinforce our ability to deliver care and support in the home, as well as in other ambulatory locations. Within the second growth area, health benefits, we're rapidly advancing the quality, innovation and consumer appeal of our plan offerings and bringing value-based care to scale. In Medicare Advantage, our strategic balance of benefit stability and enhancements once again helped to deliver strong growth. We remain well on track to serve an additional 800,000 people in 2022, consistent with the expectations we set last November. In the commercial benefits market, our innovative offerings such as physician-led and virtual first plans have grown to serve 350,000 more people over the past year. This underscores the consumer appeal for these high-quality primary care-based coverage options. Nearly 90% of newly enrolled people in our individual exchange offerings, selected plans with significant virtual components in the most recent open enrollment period and nearly 30% selected a virtual-first offering. You'll see us expand such offerings as we look forward to 2023. In our third growth area, Health Technology, we continue to execute on the major new health system partnerships initiated last year, including a broad relationship with SSM Health and its 11,000 providers caring for people throughout the Midwest. We are helping our health system partners alleviate administrative burdens and create an operational capacity for these organizations to focus on delivering high-quality patient care and experiences. These partnerships move far beyond traditional revenue cycle management with both clinical and technology features becoming important. Fourth, our developing efforts in health financial services, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers, and consumers, while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience, consider our new integrated consumer card, which we introduced in January. Many people typically have separate cards for clinical care, pharmacy benefits, food assistance programs, fitness, rewards programs and more. We've combined these benefits into a single card vastly simplifying the experience for consumers and providers, and we plan to do even more in the future. And finally, pharmacy services. The high cost of specialty drugs is one of the most pressing issues for our health plan partners. Drawing upon all of Optum's advanced analytical capabilities, we're collaborating with health plans to provide clinicians access to real-time medical and pharmacy analytics, which are coordinated with a patient-specific benefit plan design, enabling clinicians to determine the most effective and appropriate therapies at the point of care. Our initial results are highly positive, helping to lower specialty costs by over 15%. Overall, OptumRx's performance in the quarter, healthy strong sales pipeline provide a great foundation for growth. These efforts from expanding in-home and broad value-based care offerings to enhancements to Medicare Advantage to simplifying how to finance care are designed to create greater value for consumers and more broadly, have a profound impact on the lives of families and individuals and communities with all levels of need across America, which is a powerful motivation for all of us at this company each and every day. Dirk McMahon, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will now share more about these efforts. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. There is no more important aspect of the consumer experience in health care than convenient access to quality care, not theoretical access but care when and where people need it. Testing, for instance, is an area where we see significant opportunity to improve the consumer experience. It can be a burden for people to test for conditions such as colorectal cancer. As a result, too often, people just won't deal with the hassle early-stage condition, and as a result, early-stage conditions go undiagnosed and people don't get the care they need until things get really serious, which is bad for their health and results in unnecessarily higher intensity treatments and costs in the future. Like many of you, we have observed more willingness by patients for trial and adoption of in-home testing for many types of chronic conditions. However, it can be challenging for people to first, find test and then make sure the results get back into a doctor's workflow. Patients need to call providers for a prescription, go to disparate locations to pick up the test and then somehow get the piece of paper with a test result into an already busy clinic operation. At UnitedHealthcare, we've introduced an integrated solution that addresses all of the tasks that need to occur sequentially for test results to get into a clinic system. This digitally enabled solution is resulting in nearly 10% increase in people obtaining necessary screening versus a multi-step process. We are expanding this vital capability to more people and making additional types of tests available as well. As many of you know, the first quarter tends to be the most impactful in setting us up for operational success for the remainder of the year. The ease of that initial experience for people has a lasting impact on consumer and customer perceptions and buying decisions, not just for the next three months, but often for years to come. So we thought it would be timely and helpful to provide a bit of a performance report card for the quarter. A short version, this is where we owe a great thank you to the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Perhaps nowhere was this more apparent than in the onboarding of the many new people served under value based arrangements within OptumHealth. Investing in the preparation of systems and training in physicians and staff was critical in laying the groundwork to provide high quality care for these new patients and expanding into new geographies. For example, in Ohio and New York, we are observing early improvements in post-acute trends such as skilled nursing facility admits declining 25% in just the first quarter of operation. It's a testament to the deep integration of our post-acute capabilities for transitioning patients to the most appropriate setting for their needs as well as a patient-centric orientation of our local care delivery organizations and their vigilance on care continuity. At UnitedHealthcare, our digital investments are continuing to serve our care providers and helping advance our efforts to move to a paperless experience. In the first quarter, visits to our digital portal continued to increase, while provider support costs declined about 12% from historical averages. Importantly, we have driven a 38% increase in providers using digital documents instead of paper in just this first quarter compared to last year. We expect the efforts we have taken in this quarter will save 80 tonnes of paper over the next five years. Before handing off to John, let me briefly -- let me turn briefly to our pending combination with Change Healthcare. By now, it should be clear we are deeply committed to helping achieve a simpler, more intelligent an adaptive health system for patients, payers and providers. The combination of Optum and Change Healthcare will connect and simplify core clinical, administrative and payment processes, health care providers and payers depend on to serve patients. Increasing efficiency and reducing friction will benefit the entire health system, resulting in lower costs and a better experience for all stakeholders. Our extended agreement with Change Healthcare reflects our firm belief in the potential benefits of this combination to improve health care and in our ability to successfully overcome the challenge to this merger. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2022 performance positions us well to deliver on our full year financial and growth objectives. Revenues grew by $10 billion or 14% to $80 billion over the year ago first quarter, with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This strong diversified growth was largely organic with balanced contributions from across both our services and benefits operating platforms. Compared to a year ago, we are adding over 1 million more people to OptumHealth, supporting 30% more patients in value-based relationships, providing over 20 million more prescriptions and serving 1.5 million more people across our health benefit offerings. I'll start by providing a little color on care patterns over the course of the quarter and then turn to our individual businesses. As you'd expect, there was considerable variation in care patterns due to the COVID incidence peak early in the quarter. For example, in January, we had about 40,000 COVID related hospitalizations, the highest of any months since the onset of the pandemic. By March, these declined to around 2,000. Overall, care in the quarter was about at baseline levels though we observe pockets that are modestly below historical baseline, such as emergency department and pediatric visits. However, we are not assuming this is a permanent shift in consumer behaviour. As it relates to potential longer term health impacts on people due to care which was deferred during the height of the pandemic, thus far we are not seeing the increasing acuity that many expected. For example, initial oncology related diagnosis levels are consistent with historical averages. Of course, our core focus remains on getting people the care they need and we are encouraged that critical screens are occurring at normalized levels. Moving now to business performance. OptumHealth revenue grew 34% in the first quarter, and earnings from operations rose over 40%. Revenue per consumer grew 33%. This was driven primarily by the increasing number of patients served under value-based arrangements. Continued augmentation of our value-based care offerings, such as expanding digital care and our services into the home, the opportunity to serve more people, much more broadly and deeply. And we expect to grow strongly for years to come. OptumInsight revenue grew 13% year-over-year. The revenue backlog was $22.8 billion, growth of $2 billion or 10% over the prior year. Our expanding health system partnerships are contributing to this growth, and we expect the number and breadth of these partnerships to continue to grow. OptumRx revenues grew 11% to $24 billion, reflecting the strength of new business relationships secured over the course of last year. We typically incur significant investments in the early months of these expansions to assure strong performance and value for our customers. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Revenue growth of 14% was driven across the businesses. Our Medicare Advantage offerings remain on track to add up to 800,000 people. About three quarters will be an individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. New seniors aging into Medicare are increasingly selecting Medicare Advantage based on the value it offers and the 5-star quality plan performance we achieved this year enables us to enroll people in our plan offerings through the year. People served by our Medicaid offerings grew by over 150,000 in the first quarter and is now approaching $8 million. Our growth outlook for the remainder of the year continues to incorporate an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations when the public health emergency lapses, resulting in modest net attrition. First quarter commercial enrollment was in line with our expectations. The decline in people served under fee-based arrangements was driven by three previously known customer transitions, which were offset by core growth. We see the number of people served overall increasing as we progress through '22, driven by the strong market response to our more recently introduced innovative offerings, as well as the continued recovery in the total number of people covered by employer health benefits, which typically lags reported job growth.  Our capital capacities remain strong. First quarter cash flows from operations of $5.3 billion or 1x net income were consistent with our expectations. And we continue to expect full year cash flows of about $24 billion or 1.2x net income. We returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases, and ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38%.  And as we look toward completing both the LHC and change combinations this year, we will continue to have ample capacities to expand upon the ways we can serve people and help them to live healthier lives. As noted earlier, based on this growth outlook, today we increased our adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.20 to $21.70 per share. And we continue to expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience with just under 50% of the full year earnings in the first half.  Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, John. I hope that you will recognize the consistent themes that we laid out last year as our guidepost for sustainable growth. Our focus on execution and continuous improvement across our businesses is a characteristic that we're going to sustain as we build upon this strong start to 2022.  And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator:  We will now take our first question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nLisa Gill: Hi, thanks very much good morning. John, I just want to go back to your comments around utilization trends. You talked about hospitalization now down to 2,000 here in March. But baseline somewhat moderating back, but you talked about ER&Ps. But can you maybe just talk about the difference of what you're seeing in commercial versus government? And then secondly, it sounds like you are not really anticipating that there's still a lot of pent-up demand. Am I hearing that correctly? And how do I think about the trend as we move here towards the back half of the year?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Let me ask John to respond to the first part and then Brian Thompson, maybe you could just speak to a little bit the demand piece and maybe Brian pick up within that any sense of acuity shifts. I think that would be helpful for the folks who are listening. John, first.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Lisa, it's John. Yes, so in the first quarter, still seeing similar trends in terms of utilization across the different categories you talked about. A little bit higher in commercial. A little bit lower in government programs. But everything kind of trending back more to those baseline levels, overall. And pointing out, as you appropriately noted here, we were still seeing some pockets here of differentiation, such as impedes and emergency department. That's been a trend we've seen, not to the point yet where we'd expect that to continue, but a consumer differences that we've noted. Also on your comment, and Brian will go into this much more deeply, but as it relates to the potential for acuity, this is something we talked about very early on in the pandemic, as people were missing treatments and how might they come back into the system. It's still something we're extremely watchful for across very -- a lot of categories. I spoke specifically to oncology and what we're seeing in those areas. So good to see people getting their screenings. What we haven't seen, though, is this expectation we had for the incidence rates might actually come up because of missed treatments over their earlier period. And, Brian, could you offer a little more commentary.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks, John, and thanks for the question, Lisa. I think John summed it up nicely. As you expected, the quarter was odd in that, obviously, there was stronger levels of hospitalizations and infections in January, and that clearly deteriorated down to a lower level in March, so kind of a tale of two stories inside the quarter. As John alluded to, commercial, a little more close to baseline, with Medicaid being the lowest and Medicare in between. When you think about service type, inpatient running slightly above baseline, but that was really a function of January in those higher hospitalizations that we saw and really encouraged as we look at physician visits, because those accelerated through the quarter, sort of, offsetting and consistent with the reduction in infection levels. On strain dynamics, maybe another thing I'll point out, clearly, less severe in Omicron than what we saw in Delta. We saw hospitalizations at about half the level that we saw. But again, confirming what John said, really no signs of deferred care, and we've been watching this closely throughout the pandemic, looking at screens, diagnosis, severity, progression. And it usually cycles through pretty quickly after we've seen large infections within two to three months to get back to baseline. And that's where we're at right now, leaving the quarter. So feel good about where we're at as we pace forward into the next quarter.\nAndrew Witty: Great. John and Brian, thanks so much for that. Yes, it was a very -- it was definitely a quarter of two parts in terms of January and then how February and March move forward with the shift in impacts of Omicron during this quarter. And -- but I think what you've heard from both John and Brian really reflects the kind of movement back towards kind of baseline activities with one or two exceptions. Rest assured, we are really watching like a hawk to see any evolving trend around acuity shift. Obviously, that's super important from a patient welfare perspective. But so far, we haven't seen very many signals of that at all. But it's maybe still early days. Lisa, thanks so very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just thought I might ask, where, obviously, a lot of discussion in the broad market about inflationary pressures. And my sense is, you're pretty well matched, particularly on the insurance side, but I wonder if you might take a few minutes and just sort of think. I know there's a lot of different things going on in Optum. How do you feel as we enter a period where there may be a little more inflationary pressure that you're matched revenue versus cost? Is there any pressure points? Is there any places where it's actually helpful to you? Maybe comment on that.\nAndrew Witty: A.J., thanks so much for the question. I'll make a couple of comments and maybe ask Dirk a little bit to reflect on the broader perspective. And then, Brian, again, just to talk a little bit to within the UHC portfolio. I mean, generally speaking, I want to make it super clear. Our focus always is to try and get the very best value proposition for our clients, members and patients. And I think at the time of inflation, that responsibility we carry really seriously. So, making sure that there are advocates really in the system to get the best deal possible for the folks who rely on us to continue to get good access to health care services and the care they need when they need it is something we're very focused on. So, we're fortunate to have some very long-term positions in place with a wide range of inputs that we rely on, which is obviously important. Brian may talk a little bit to that in a second from a UHC perspective. But whether you look at our OptumRx portfolio where we're going to continue to focus on getting really the lowest inflationary pressures. As an overall agenda, this is a time where UnitedHealth Group in all of its parts is going to be first and foremost, do everything it can to protect the people who rely on us from the forces of inflation. With that backdrop, maybe Dirk, you could pick up a little bit more broadly some of the things we're doing in the company and then pass to Brian.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. So thanks, Andrew. Yes, hi A.J. So, first of all, yes, we're always sensitive to the challenges that people face in health care, specifically from a cost perspective. That's a big reason why we have affordability agenda that's really focused on total cost of care, lowering total cost of care for people, and also telling people in these inflationary times how they get more out of their benefits that they purchased from us. We've also done things we've talked before about getting really some good products in the marketplace, like our virtual products, which are 15% lower than other prevailing products in those markets. And as Andrew said, we're working really hard on technology to improve productivity. One of the things we're trying to do from a productivity standpoint is do that to enable us to make targeted investments in our people and to or otherwise pass that through in the form of premiums to folks. So, those are things from a productivity standpoint that on. From a labor strategy standpoint, more broadly, at the last fall as the sort of the great resonation progressed, we made some investments -- targeted investments in our people. In the first quarter, we had our normal merit review cycle with raises. So, we're trying to make from an internal perspective, the right thing to do. But as we look forward in -- for the remainder of the year, we're going to have to make -- continue to make targeted investments in areas like clinicians and in customer service folks where we see higher levels of attrition. So that's a broad brush as to what we're as to what we're doing. Brian, go ahead.\nBrian Thompson: Yes, thanks, Dirk. As you might expect, there are good disciplines in management inside UnitedHealthcare that I'm pleased with where we're at, pricing to our forward view of costs being one, including inflation, Obviously, we have some provider agreements that do offer multiyear predictability, but this is less about being insulated from the overall inflation environment and more about our responsibility to drive down that total cost is Dirk alluded to. And I'm more encouraged than ever on things like value-based care, consumer transparency to navigate the system to get to the appropriate side of service, having the tools digitally to ensure we can enable that virtual engagement and post-acute and home innovation to really avoid those expensive hospital stay. So, those are the elements that we can really drive to try to offset the overall cost.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Brian, very well said, I think. And our response to inflation is innovation. Simple as that. The way in which we're going to get the best outcome for folks who rely on us is to continue to innovate, how we work inside the company to deliver greater productivity, how we deliver efficient access to the system for members and patients, how we take advantage of things like virtual care platforms and how we truly bring to life the value of value-based care and all of the work that's going on between UnitedHealthcare and Optum, that is going to be a tremendous aid to us in ensuring that we can manage through this on behalf of the people who rely on us. So A.J., thanks so much for the question. Next question please operator.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks and good morning. I had a question just on the LHCG acquisition. And I guess, a two-parter. First, just as you've conducted a portfolio review of LHCG's assets. Just interested if you've made a decision yet on whether you plan to retain all of the key assets separate from home health, particularly thinking about hospice and personal care. And then we'll just also be interested just on some of the key synergies that you're seeing as you look out to integrate LHCG into Optum's broader clinical platform, particularly when thinking about some of the more adjacent assets such as Landmark and Navi Health that you already have in the home base care umbrella? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for the question. And I'm going to ask Wyatt Decker in a second to give you a little more response on this. LHC, we're incredibly proud of coming to an agreement with the LHC Board to bring together the two organizations. Obviously, it's a transaction, which hasn't closed yet. So I'm not going to go into too much detail about it. But let me say a few things. And I had a great pleasure, even on Monday, actually to spend some good time with the founders and the leadership team of LHC. Unbelievable positive culture inside the organization that's been built up by Keith and Ginger since they first founded it, really a company with a true heart and really puts patients first and their families first extraordinary impact in all of their lines of operations and how they can have a significant impact on the lives of people who very often are excluded from care. This is really about opening up access to a lot of people who would not otherwise find easy access to the system is really important. And I like very much all of the aspects I've seen of that organization look forward very much to successfully bringing it into the UnitedHealth Group portfolio. I would also say, and this is why I'm going to ask Dr. Decker to take a little bit more deeper dive, we're really moving at speed to bring together our home and community capabilities. And if you look at what's really driving alongside our value-based strategy for the clinics, the rapid growth of our home and community offering, which has brought together, the NaviHealth, Landmark will over time, align with LHC when it joins into the organization built on our original Optima Home product. It's an extraordinary set of capabilities and it's positioning us very well to, for example, serve the D-SNP population in a way, which historically would not have been possible. And that, as you've heard from John earlier, is a big piece of our growth in the first quarter. And maybe with that backdrop, I'll pass to Dr. Decker to give you a little more detail.\nWyatt Decker: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. And Scott, thank you for the question. We are very excited with the combination of LHC Group. I think Andrew said it well. They have a long-standing culture since they're founding in a small community in Louisiana 1994 of commitment to serve others and help people live their healthiest lives in a home care setting. They've developed multiple capabilities, which actually really nicely complement our growing home and community platform that Andrew touched on. So very excited about that. The quality of care that they provide is remarkable. It's a full 33% higher in the stars quality ratings than the national average for home health care just as an example. And we share this commitment to quality and service. So we feel it's a really good alignment. And then building on your question and Andrew's comments, as we weave home healthcare together with the more kind of complex offerings of post-acute care and complex care in the home that we've already brought into our home community platform, we see remarkable synergies, and this will continue to grow. It also begins to address the question of why has it been so hard to have home care be delivered in a value-based construct. And our vision is with these comprehensive set of offerings stitching it together in a way that is differentiated and helps people get better healthcare outcomes. Initially, we'll help deploy them in the post-acute care setting right out of the gate. Thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: All right. Thanks, Dr. Decker. And A.J., thanks so much for the question. I'll maybe leave you with one thought on LHC actually and just for your awareness, 85% of LHC providers are 4-star or better rating from a quality perspective. I mean that just tells you everything you need to know about that organization and why we wanted to be part of our family. We think it's going to bring great access, great quality to members and families across the country. A. J., thanks so much for the question. Next question, operator, please?\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Justin Lake, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask a question about value-based care. First, kind of with the improvement in the outlook for penetration there. I'm curious if you were to step back and look at the entire kind of value-based care operation you have and think about the penetration in terms of capitation, if you could share that number with us, meaning the total TAM there of your physicians and their patients, how many of them are already in value-based care and what's the potential still to come? And then just given all the competition in the space. I thought it's interesting, there's been some industry chatter that you made a large acquisition or might be making a large acquisition in Houston. Can you talk about the M&A pipeline there? And given the competition, do you still see it as being as robust as it was, let's say, three to five years ago? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Justin, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask in a second, I\u2019ll ask Brian just to reflect a little bit on the kind of direction of travel for value-based care. I think it's super interesting to hear the perspective from a payer perspective because Obviously, what Brian and his team are looking for is how do they deliver the very best outcome and value for the folks who rely on him. But before I go to that, a couple of things. We probably I'm not sure we need to kind of go into a ton of speculation on what the potential would be. Where I would focus on is look at the rate of growth that's going on right now. So that movement in terms of growth of Medicare Advantage that Brian is leading that growth, 600,000 folks coming into the OptumCare value-based capitated environment under Dr. Decker's organization. We're focused on knowing that we are able to sustain that level of transfer and growth over many years to come. So what the ultimate ceiling is on that. I think actually is a product of our ability to continue to deliver a fantastically innovative and high-quality capability in the marketplace. And that's going to continue to attract very large numbers of folks who want to be part of and benefit from it. So I'm a little less thoughtful about what could the ceiling be? I'm much more motivated by and excited by the way in which we're at the 500,000, 600,000 rates moving across our ability to both move and grow and win external business as part of that agenda is going to be the thing that we're focused on. So maybe with that, Brian, I'd ask you to go a little further from your perspective.\nBrian Thompson: Yes. I think similar to what you said, for me, it's less about a number. I will say there's a lot of runway left. It's been about geographic expansion historically. Now it's much more than that. We've moved into duals, it's about complex care, it's about home. So, the breadth and scale is really at the core of it. And UnitedHealthcare is deeply incented to continue this journey with Optum. When you think about our best retention levels, when you think about satisfaction, when you think about where we have the lowest trend that drives the best benefits, the best quality and the best growth, all of those outcomes come when we partner with Optum. So, we're -- we have strong incentives to continue this, and I'm encouraged because there's still a lot of runway left.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And Justin, just to come back to your second question around pipeline, as you'd expect, we don't comment on transactions speculation. But let me just make a few general points. You saw during Q1, we successfully closed and announced the bringing of Refresh Health into the organization. great business built by Steve Gold and his team, helping us build out our behavioral delivery capabilities within OptumHealth complements super nicely.  Our largest behavioral health network that we already have across the country from the benefit side of the business, so continue to operate there. I'd say, overall, our pipeline of opportunities, I actually think is probably as diverse as it's ever been and probably deeper than it's ever been. So, I think from a potential capital deployment capability, I think we feel pretty optimistic about that.  We continue -- as you see, we continue to be extremely disciplined about ensuring of all the very many opportunities that we see, that we focus on the ones which, first and foremost nestle centrally within our core strategies, those five growth areas I touched on earlier, Refresh Mental Health is a great example of that. So it's right into that value-based proposition in terms of how we believe we need to bring behavioral health management alongside medical management.  So first off, we need to sit centrally within our strategic framework. We need to believe in the culture and the capability of the leadership teams that we're welcoming into UnitedHealth Group. And of course, the economics have to fit with our demanding expectations to support our long-term growth ambitions of 13% to 16% and also the returns that our shareholders rightly expect. So that drives us forward. I feel confident about our ability to continue to deploy capital, which has always been a key element of helping us deliver long-term growth. So hope that gives you a little sense of where we stand, Justin. And maybe with that and the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. \nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I just had a question. Now that we're thinking about OptumHealth, the type of growth, Andrew, that you were just talking about and really tens of billions of dollars of capitated risk, how do we think about the reserving, if OptumHealth was a stand-alone company, how do we think about reserving against that risk its taking? I presume capitate from UHC is an elimination, has all the other payer medical expense accrual, is that just rolling through your total medical accrual, John, or is there somewhere else on the balance sheet where there's payable numbers we should be paying attention to?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Gary, thanks so much. Let me go straight to John to respond to that.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Gary, it's John. Yes, it'll be rolling through in the by in the same place that you'd be seeing everything else in terms of how those occur. You're right in terms of how you think about eliminations with UnitedHealthcare business versus external business, which would not be eliminated, of course. But all in the same place in terms of how we would be appropriately reserving for those arrangements.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you so much, John. Gary, thank you very much. Emma, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please, go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the growth in OptumHealth for a minute. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that $100,000 higher number? Is that an organic number? Is that driven by deals? Is it direct contracting? Is it internally United? Is it external? Is there some way to kind of thing about that growth and what drove it? And then, I guess, just generally speaking, when you think about deals in that space, how are you thinking about multiples, either on earnings or on where you think the long term earnings can eventually be when you move that practice to capitation? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, could you just repeat the second part of the quarter? I just lost you in the middle of that just. Could you just repeat that?\nKevin Fischbeck: Sorry. Yes. Just the second part was just about deal multiples and physicians. So, I mean, I don't know how you think about it, whether it's on the actual earnings or whether it's on kind of a normalized earnings in five years, once you move that practice entirely to capitation, just trying to think about how we should think about the returns on the capital you're spending in this area.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Okay, great. Listen, Kevin, thanks so much. I'll hand to Dr. Decker to respond to you on the first part of where that extra $100,000 taken us up to $600,000 is coming from, and it'd be good for you to hear that from him. I think in terms of how we think about how we invest in this space, I'd say, each one is pretty much a unique situation, right? I mean, every doctor clinic, they're all different. They've all got tremendously different histories, situations, dynamics. And, obviously, we take a view within a broad piece of not just what have they achieved to date, but how alongside the rest of our capabilities can we build opportunities and value for patients and the utilizers of those environments. And that's what really drives our kind of economic assessment. Now, I think, what you can see is the way in which we understand and seek to continue to learn how to work better and better within the value-based envelope and how we can utilize the skills of these organizations, allows us be confident in being able to set very fairly, reward people who choose to join our organization, and that's what's driving our ability to be successful integrators of some phenomenal people and their teams across the country. And I'm so pleased they stay inside the organization. And it\u2019s super nice to be able to see OptumHealth continue to strengthen itself as a physician-led organization. And I think that is really contrasting to many others out there. This is an organization led by physicians at every level of the organization, and it makes a huge difference in terms of the way the heart and soul of this place is starting to be. And, I think, that's what underpins a lot of our contribution and competitiveness. With that, Dr. Decker, as the physician leader of the organization, maybe you could just reflect a little bit on how you're successfully driving up that growth rate.\nWyatt Decker: Sure, Andrew, happy to do it and, Kevin, thanks for the question. What you're really seeing is a result of almost 10 years of building a flywheel that now has significant momentum. We've invested in people, in technology, in data and building out networks and deepening in our established geographies as well as going into new geographies. All of that continues to yield benefits and, frankly, growth. Your question is rate. Is it organic growth that added that additional $100,000? And the answer is, yes. We saw strong results in open enrollment, member retention. And we, of course, have not only four-star plants, but five-star plants that are able to enroll patients year-round. That's also true of duals. And one final point that I'll note is that we are now -- a third of this growth this year is in the dual special needs population. And these are individuals that have difficulty accessing care, and we're able to provide care with home and community, meaning wraparound solutions in their home. So it's another model that helps us grow. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you so much. Kevin, thanks so much for the question. Much appreciated. Next question please.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thank you. Just a follow-up on a previous question. I wanted to ask a little bit more directly about significantly higher interest rate environment we're currently experiencing. Was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you expect this will impact the investment portfolio over the next couple of years as your investments mature and reinvested at higher rates. And I guess also, how should we think about this as impacting EPS growth rate you target? Is this potential upside or tailwind is going to be used to offset inflationary pressures elsewhere or maybe a softer economic backdrop, or is this something you think could actually be a net tailwind to our earnings growth over the next few years? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Stephen, thanks so much for the question. John?\nJohn Rex: Good morning. Yes, certainly, anything more than 0% interest rates is going to be helpful to us overall as we move in that environment. But it does take some time, as I think as you're accurately pointing out here. So, maybe a few perspectives I could offer on that. Roughly 40% of our $70 billion in cash and investments is tied to floating rates. So, that would be the first cut you'd want to take of that. The other 60% would be in the fixed rate environment. So, as you are alluding to, those will mature and be reinvested at higher rates over time. But not much of that piece would have any year one impact call it, in terms of how 1 would think about that. So, maybe just to give you a hypothetical here. Say you had a 100 basis point increase in interest rates. So, that would impact that 40% or call it roughly $28 billion of cash investments that are tied to floating rates. So, that would be the first place you'd see that. So, put that in the zone of it's really about $28 billion in that component. So, $280 million impact on investment income. Important to note on that, we also have about $10 billion of floating rate liabilities. So, think about the swaps floating the rest of commercial paper. So, that would also have about $100 million offset to that $280 million. So, that would be the zone I'd put you in, if you think about getting 12 months out from a first 100 basis point increase, that would be the zone. The rest of that portfolio, the other 60% will roll off over a period of years, call it, think of that probably maybe $5 billion a year rolling off as those things mature, and that would be the pacing that you should expect.\nStephen Baxter: Thank you\nAndrew Witty: John, thank you very much, Stephen thanks so much for the question. And the next question please.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Josh Raskin from Nephron. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak to the local market strategy, more on the Optum side in markets like New York or Houston or maybe Houston soon. I'm specifically curious about how much of the delivery system you feel you need to employ, control, own, and how we should be thinking about sort of long-term success and growth. Is that on the delivery side? Does that manifest on the benefit side as well? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks so much. It's a great question, actually. And I would say -- and again, I'm going to ask Wyatt to go much deeper for you on this. I would say that over the decade or so that this has been developing at Optum, I think our views are probably -- it's fair to say evolved quite a bit in terms of what the right way to operate. And not only in terms of what might be the right blend of relationships with ourselves and the physicians Also, the role of physicians versus advanced practice clinicians and others and also the role of what happens in a clinic-based environment versus a home-based environment. And I'd say particularly over the last, I don't know, maybe the last 24 months, I think that has moved on quite a lot in terms of how we're thinking about this. So I would just frame it. I'm going to hand right now to Wyatt, but I would just frame it, maybe, Josh, in those three dimensions, right? Location, kind of, relationship between and then type of clinician are, I think, evolving dynamics around, which we're becoming more and more opinionated. Maybe on that, Wyatt, you could go a little deeper.\nWyatt Decker: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, Josh, for the question. Andrew framed it up very accurately. And so our thinking and frankly, the practice and value-based medicine is evolving as we're able to go into the home, provide virtual care and behavioral care and comprehensive services even that overcome things like social determinants. So in markets like New York state that have primarily been fee-for-service, we do see an opportunity to move to value-based care. And it's a blend of employed physicians and affiliated and contracted physicians. But increasingly, it is bringing all of the solutions that we offer within Optum, including OptumRx and other places in the enterprise and OptumHealth to bear on helping people get the best health care outcomes possible, lower the total cost of care and actually make care very convenient for health care consumers. And that's a differentiated in the marketplace. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Wyatt, thanks so much. Josh, thanks for the question. Next question please, Emma.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. So OptumRx grew EBIT mid-single digits. Should we think about this as a steady state based on growth, and if we think about  coming to market sometime next year, is high single-digit EBIT growth a reasonable place for us to model on top of what we've seen this quarter? And just one follow-up, I think, Dirk, you talked about in-home testing in your prepared remarks. Is this something that you're focusing on the Medicare and dual book, or is this also an offering to the commercial book? And is that -- and are you working with the national labs on that strategy?\nAndrew Witty: Ricky, thanks so much for the questions. Before I go to Heather, let's tackle your first question -- your second question first, and maybe I'll go to Tim Noel to comment a little bit from the perspective of the Medicare book that you're looking at in terms of the home testing opportunity and dynamic.\nTim Noel: Yeah, Ricky, Tim Noel here. Thank you very much for the question. In-home testing is certainly a huge area of focus for us. There\u2019s, obviously, a component of it that relates to some of the work that we do on an annual basis with respect to Star and closing some of those gaps related to the Star measurement methodology. But more recently, we've really been focused on reaching out to people that we know to be under-diagnosed for conditions like Hep C and diabetes. And in doing this, we've reached out over the last year to about one million members who we suspect to be under-diagnosed and offering in-home testing solutions that are then delivered by our health call partners over at Optum. I mean these completion rates have been really promising, 35% last year, and we'll continue to evaluate expanding this program. That will do a really nice job of helping us understand where conditions are under-diagnosed and can be better treated.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Yeah. So Tim did a great job explaining Ricky, and direct answer to your question, we have started with Medicare and we'll move to commercial as we proceed along. But this is a Medicare start was what I was talking about specifically.\nAndrew Witty: Excellent. Thanks so much. Now just before I hand over to Heather to go deeper on the OptumRx piece. Ricky, as you alluded to, as we roll into next year, in particular, we're coming into a kind of a bit of a new cycle for pharma in a way in terms of the biosimilar opportunities and obviously, you refer to one very significant one, really an important one. So it's clearly going to be a super dynamic environment, which we're Heather's team is absolutely engaged in and getting ready for. I would just say, as I look, very pleased to see that acceleration of growth rate during the first quarter, and that's down to a tremendous amount of hard work in terms of developing the right product and service driving our retention and, of course, win rate. And one of the things I keep an eye on is the number of bid opportunities that we have in front of us, right, in terms of what's coming in. It's been super interesting to see that ratchet up over the last 12 months or so. So the market -- the market is activating. I don't think you'd be super surprised to hear that given the last couple of years, but it is activating. So we're seeing more and more business come to market. Been super reassured by our sustained very, very high retention rates. And Heather, now maybe can reflect a little bit on how she sees that all playing out over the next year or two. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Thank you. Thank you. Yes, maybe I'll just build on what Andrew said, just first, maybe, Ricky, to your question, you can see our relentless focus under just growth in the pharmacy benefit business, but also the pharmacy services and the direct-to-consumer. So that will continue to support our top line growth. That will support that retention and continued growth -- membership growth in the PBM. But in addition, those pharmacy services become increasingly important as we look at the future in these coming years, you're right, there's -- as we look long anticipated introduction of multiple opportunities in biosimilar and other specialty services for our members. The services that we offer through our pharmacy services programs are really, I think, going to drive not just the growth in our -- the top line of our business, that continued push in our earnings, which as committing to our guidance for this year, which you see it as a mid- to high actually single-digits. And then longer term kind of moderating in the mid-single digits, and that's really that relentless focus on pushing the value and from the pharmacy services into our clients and into our patients and our clients' consumers and making sure that we continue to drive the tools and services that our clients will pay for. Those are our clients, our external book of clients, our UnitedHealthcare client, and that's also our pharmacy services clients like our community pharmacy clients, which really need services and offerings like our behavioral health services that really integrate a fragmented system. So I look at the whole thing. And as we move forward, the tools like our clinical analytics, our PBM, our specialty program management services that were referenced in by Andrew early in our script this morning, as well as our continued push to transform using our pharmacists as the way we're really going to grow our business.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Heather, thanks so much. And Ricky, thank you very much for the question. We just have time for one last question. So Emma, maybe go to the last question.\nOperator: Certainly. We will now take our final question from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks and good morning. So just to tie a lot of things together that have been talked about on the call, with the $0.90 increase in EPS guidance for 2022, just wanted to ask for a little bit more color on how much of this better outlook is driven by the Optum segment in particular versus the UHC segment versus any other factors at the corporate level? I'm guessing it's maybe mostly driven by Optum and maybe OptumHealth within that, but also what else ex Optum is maybe performing better, that's worth calling out as well? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Steven, thanks so much. I think maybe you misspoke. It's a \u2013 we increased our guidance range this year by $0.10, both at the top and the bottom of the guidance range just to reconfirm that. But listen, that raise is essentially based on the strong performance of Q1, good start to the year. We feel good about that. While -- as always, there's a lot of moving parts in our world and you've heard from people like Brian in some detail about some of the dynamic of the first quarter, actually, as it all comes together, the year is kind of shaping up pretty much in-line with the expectations we were laying out to you all in November last year.  Strong performance is supported by execution across all of our businesses. I would say, all of the core businesses of Optum, of UnitedHealthcare have started the year well. We continue to be very focused on the execution of those within those businesses, of course and I think what you're continuing to see, and I hope you've heard some of that in the conversation today and it's certainly reflecting through the results. is the synergy opportunities, which are coming to life between the two organizations, you heard a lot about value-based care, now that whole value-based care model, which we believe is truly capable of transforming experiences, not just for patients, but for physicians and payers. That's a product of the two organizations working together.  The development of in-home care, same thing, very much being led by the two organizations working together. And increasingly, what we're seeing as we strengthen our capabilities in areas like that with our deployment of capital and some of the acquisitions we\u2019ve been making. So for example organizations like naviHealth, Landmark and others, that's then driving strong external growth as well.  So really, really demonstrating how building these kind of fundamental innovations in the way in which care can be thought about, can then not just be attractive to UnitedHealthcare, of course, but also to many other payers and completely reinforces our deep commitment to be a multi-payer organization, building products and services in Optum which work not just for UHC, but for payers across the spectrum. And that's what you're seeing supporting the business. And it supports our confidence in raising the outlook for the rest of this year.  So I hope that gives you a clear sense of that and very much appreciate that final question, Steven. And thank you to everybody else for joining the call this morning. We truly appreciate your interest and your attention. I hope what you heard in the call today is a strong sense of the confidence in our long-term strategy. And as I just said again, an intensely disciplined focus in its execution. We're aiming to create value for consumers, advancing our mission and delivering high-quality diversified growth in this quarter and for many years to come. We look forward to sharing that progress with you again when we next talk in July. Thank you so much, and appreciate your attention today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. You may now all disconnect."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2024-01-12 12:08:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings report section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call contained in the earnings release will be issued -- we issued this morning in our Form 8-K dated January 12, 2024, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you and good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we conclude 2023 and embark on a new year, I'd like to express my gratitude to our more than 400,000 talented colleagues who really were UnitedHealth Group. It's directly due to their tireless efforts over the past year that we expanded our opportunities to serve more people, more comprehensively. As I reflect on our 2023 performance, certainly, the shift in care activity among seniors was an important element for us to manage effectively, and the reduced Medicare Advantage funding outlook was a significant influence on how we prepared for 2024 and all the way through to 2026. Despite the shifting care patterns and the commensurate pressure felt during \u201823, we've been able to both deliver on our growth commitments and invest and prepare for reduced MA funding cycle over the next three years. Even considering these factors, 2023 marked the year of balanced, sustainable growth for UnitedHealth Group. Importantly, we also strengthened the foundations, from which we will continue to grow in 2024 and beyond. To illustrate briefly during 2023, Optum Health approached growth of 900,000 more patients under value-based care. UnitedHealthcare added over 1.7 million new consumers in its Medicare and commercial offerings. Optum Rx managed an additional 100 million prescriptions for people. Optum Financial handled more than $500 billion in consumer payer and care provider payments. And Optum Insights facilitated more than 23 billion electronic transactions. The increasingly impactful ways we can engage with patients, consumers, care providers, and customers resulted in revenue growth of over $47 billion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 13% in 2023. Looking to \u201824, \u201825 and beyond, we will continue to drive quality, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility to help improve healthcare system-wide, and we remain confident in and committed to our long-term 13% to 16% adjusted earnings per share growth rate. Having held our Investor Conference just six weeks ago, I'll take only a few minutes this morning to recap what you should expect from us this year, starting with our work in value-based care. Value-based care for us is a proven way of overcoming many of the widely recognized shortcomings of a fee-for-service-based health system such as fragmented consumer experiences and incentives, that can emphasize volume over quality. Our value-based offerings empower physicians to provide more connected, coordinated and comprehensive care, align incentives among consumers, care providers, and health plans, deliver better health outcomes, and improve costs. At the end of 2023, Optum Health served more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based arrangements in partnership with many dozens of health plans. By the end of this year, Optum Health will grow to serve at least another 750,000 patients, under such arrangements, for a total of more than twice the number of people we served just two years ago. Yet, even with the strong growth and significant investments we've made, our market presence is still quite modest and the opportunity expansive. 4 million patients served, just a small fraction of the many more people whose health ultimately will benefit from these models of care. And the total Optum Health revenue base, which today represents only 2% of the $5 trillion U.S. Healthcare System spend. We have a considerable distance to go, to achieve the broad positive system-wide impact for people's health we believe we can help drive. Turning to our consumer focus, we're working hard to help consumers more easily find experience and pay for healthcare, and that includes using their health benefits. One example of our progress can be seen in the results of UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits business. Most recently completed selling season was among our strongest in recent years. The majority of this growth will come from our relationships with large employers among the most sophisticated buyers of health benefits. Our customers tell us where we are focused on what their employees value most. Lower cost, simpler experiences, and adaptable benefits that meet their unique needs and circumstances. And the consumer NPS for these new innovative products is some 20 plus points higher than traditional health plans. We have more to do. Our goal is to become the trusted source for Healthcare information and advice, a go-to-market place for health services payments and benefits, all through a few simple taps on a consumer's phone. One of our larger consumer offerings is Medicare Advantage, which I'd like to touch on briefly. We're proud of our long track record of growth and delivering for the people who choose our offerings. During the recently completed annual enrollment period, we added about 100,000 more consumers and we remain committed to our full-year goal of 450,000 to 550,000. We believe our assumptions of ongoing care activity and approach to supplemental benefit management are entirely appropriate for the environment we are planning for and feel positive about our positioning for growth entering this three-year period. One additional item as we close out the year. To achieve our enterprise-wide long-term goals, we must consistently ensure best use of our resources, both time and capital to enable us to serve people more effectively and deliver value for our shareholders. As you likely saw, we recently agreed to the sale of our Brazil operations, where our dedicated colleagues serve people with care and compassion. We highly value the relationships we have developed over more than a decade in Brazil. After carefully evaluating our best course, we ultimately determined a sale was the right step for the people we serve and for us to best focus our energies on the many compelling growth opportunities that we consistently discuss with you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dirk McMahon, UnitedHealth Group's President and Chief Operating Officer. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thanks, Andrew. Our growth is rooted in innovation and our intense desire always to do better. We're investing heavily in ways to accomplish that, increasing digital engagement and using AI to be more efficient, and then measuring our performance through net promoter scores to be sure we're hitting the mark. The impact of our digital engagement efforts was evident in our one-one performance metrics. As Andrew noted, we brought on one of our biggest cohorts of new people served by our commercial offerings, and our technology played an important role in making the process work well. Since last month, the UHC mobile app consistently ranked number one or number two in the Apple App Store Medical Category and on Google Play. Through the first week of the year, mobile app installs were up over more than 100% year-over-year, and our chat volume was more than twice our historical average. At Optum Rx, digital investments enabled us to bring on a record number of new clients, who brought with them more than 3 million new consumers, on-boarded with improved customer service scores and at an overall cost, 8% lower than last year, more consumer served, higher satisfaction, and lower costs. Our investments in AI and other advanced technology play an important role in improving customer service and in productivity throughout the enterprise. For example, we are removing repetitive tasks from our workflows by using AI to help with tasks such as responses to consumer inquiries, updating provider directories, and summarizing interactions with customers and patients. This frees up our service staff and clinicians to focus on solving more complicated tasks for the people we serve. And recently we launched a new capability, where we use real-time admissions and discharge data to engage high-risk MA members immediately after an emergency department visit. Connecting them to follow-up care to ensure higher-quality post-admit outcomes and avoid readmissions. This rapid response, driven by timely clinical data has improved member engagement rates by over 300% and has an NPS of 83. NPS remains a vital way to measure how we're performing for our customers and consumers and how our digital initiatives and other efforts are impacting those measures, and leading to improved retention. Couple of examples, through digital optimization, we're providing consumers with on-demand access to care, highly personalized benefits information, real-time support, and integrated pharmacy capabilities. This is translating into significant NPS improvements in many of our businesses. And we removed friction from the system through expanded access to 24/7 virtual visits and UnitedHealthcare's efforts to eliminate nearly 20% of prior authorizations. Throughout \u201824, you should expect to see an even greater investment in our digital capabilities, as we continue to identify opportunities to, leverage technology to reduce administrative costs, improve productivity, and further enhance the consumer experience at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. And now, I'll turn it over to John Rex, UnitedHealth Group's, Chief Financial Officer. John?\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. Our colleagues' ongoing focus on further expanding and strengthening the foundations, which underpinned our growth pillars is paving the way for consistent growth in 2024 and beyond. Revenue in \u201823 of $372 billion grew by over 14% with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.16, grew 15% and brought full-year adjusted earnings per share to $25.12, a growth of 13%. As Andrew noted earlier, at the end of December, we entered into an agreement to sell our Brazil operations and expect to close in the first-half of this year. Upon closing, we expect to record a charge of approximately $7 billion, the majority of which is non-cash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over several years. The impact of this one-time charge will be excluded from our \u201824 adjusted earnings per share measure. For your modeling purposes, the full-year \u201824 outlook incorporated about $6 billion of revenue for Brazil or about 1.5% of consolidated revenue. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer some brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with those we shared with you in the first-half of \u201823. Activity levels continue to be led by outpatient care for seniors with orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories among the more prominent. As we've noted, our benefit design approach assumed these activity levels persist throughout \u201824. And the care patterns we observed exiting \u201823 reconfirmed that decision. On the margin, we saw some modest late-year seasonal activity, such as strong and welcome response from seniors to scheduled physicians at this to receive RSV vaccinations. In some cases, these were accompanied by additional necessary care being obtained, especially for people that had not seeing a physician in some time. A positive outcome for people's health. In some though, as we reflect on full-year \u201823 results, overall care activity was broadly in-line with the views we've shared earlier. And as we enter \u201924, we're confident in the response of pricing and benefit design actions we undertook. With care patterns, continuing to be supportive of our care ratio outlook of 84% plus or minus 50 basis points. Turning to the performance of our businesses in \u201823. Optum Health revenues grew by 34% to over $95 billion as we increased the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 900,000 to more than 4.1 million, expanded services in the home, and broadened and deepened the levels and types of care we offer. Optum Insight's revenues grew 30% to $18.9 billion. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $32.1 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over last year. This growth was driven by our diverse and expanding product portfolio, which connects many of the key stakeholders across healthcare, whether it's launching new decision support solutions for providers, claims editing software for payers, or simplifying the payment process for all, our continued investments are fostering the next phase of Optum Insight growth. Optum Rx revenues grew 16% to over $116 billion, driven by the continued addition of new clients, expansion with an existing relationship, and organic growth of our pharmacy services businesses. In 2023, both customer retention and new wins were among the best Optum Rx has delivered. At UnitedHealthcare full-year revenues of over $281 billion grew nearly 13%. Adding to Andrew's earlier comments, within Medicare Advantage, we expect a majority of our full-year growth outlook to be realized outside the annual enrollment period with the growth patterns consistent with those we have experienced over the more recent years. Our Medicaid enrollment outlook for 2024 balances two key elements. First is that, state redetermination activities will be largely completed by mid-year. And second, that growth within existing states such as North Carolina and other new opportunities will partially offset these impacts. Within our domestic commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1.5 million additional people in \u201824, a strong result. And we are encouraged by the continued positive customer response we are experiencing as we look ahead. Our ample capital capacities continue to underpin our long-term growth objectives. Cash flow from operations in \u201823 was $29 billion or 1.3 times net income. We returned nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends and deployed over $10 billion in growth capital to build for the future. To summarize our \u201823 performance and start to the New Year further solidifies and reinforces our confidence in both the \u201824 and long-term growth objectives we shared with you at the end of November. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John, and thank you, Dirk. Heading into 2024, I hope you all sense our confidence. We have talented people who are committed to our efforts, to help build a simpler and more consumer-friendly health system for the people we serve. And we are well-positioned to continue to deliver on the well-established commitments we've made. Operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to touch on the cost trend commentary, specifically between the Investor Day at the end of the year, looks like the MLR was a little bit higher, can you tell us what you saw there over the last month? Maybe give us some color, John, I know you guys did a great job in the second quarter of getting ahead of cost trend and utilizing some of those facility kind of insights that you have on scheduling et cetera. We're trying to figure out whether this is just seasonality or a further pickup in utilization given the Q3 to Q4 that you saw. So, maybe you could tell us what you saw -- seeing into January and just tell us where you think the Q1 comes in versus the full year? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey Justin, thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of comments, and I'm going to ask John Rex to give you a little bit more detail on the area you just talked about. So, you know, I think overall, as we look at '23, overall, it came in very much in the sort of zone we expected toward the top end of that zone, but very much within the zone of what we were expecting for the full-year and we signaled back in the middle of the year. And the bulk of that story is driven by the outpatient shift in behavior around seniors that we talked about back in June. You're right, though, post the investor conference, what we certainly saw was a click up in some seasonal activity, each of which individually are kind of pretty small. But added together just made a bit of a difference in that last run out of the quarter, around things like RSV vaccination, which has brought with it -- dragged with it, if you will, some extra utilization of services from seniors who've come in for their vaccine. Listen, to be clear, all of that is good news for healthcare, right? So these are seniors, many of whom had not been to the office for a long time. They've come back in and now got vaccinated. The physicians have picked up other things while they've been there. So a little bit of that going on combined with a little bit of heightened COVID activity just as we rolled out of the year. None of which we really think is durably impacting our outlook for \u201824. So we feel very solid around our \u201824 guidance point of 84, plus or minus 50 bps. Maybe, I ask John just to give you a little bit more click down kind of insight into all about them. Go ahead, John.\nJohn Rex: Yes. Good morning, Justin. You're absolutely right. So the prime factor here when we think about the full-year view and where we ended up being, what we talked about much earlier in the year in terms of the outpatient care activity among senior populations. And that continuing consistent with what we saw back much earlier in the year and very supportive of what we staked out in terms of the benefit design that we stepped into \u201824 with, in particular for senior populations in our Medicare Advantage products. So all those elements very much supportive of that view and the activities we undertook earlier in the year. As it relates to kind of where we landed the full year, so 10 basis points really above kind of what we indicated at the investor conference back in November of differential and Andrew hit on those items. Let me just kind of take it a little bit deep here. So, definitely some typical seasonality involved in there and the incremental elements were -- I point out a couple of items, seniors did really respond strongly to RSV vaccinations and scheduled physician visits. Sometimes those physician visits, what we noted were driving other care activity around that. So in some cases, seniors that hadn't perhaps been to a physician in a little while, and so they visited their PCP, got an RSV vaccine, and then in the meantime, their PCPs were able to close some additional care gaps as they were there, which is a great thing because some of these seniors hadn't been in for a while. So important activity to occur there in the fourth quarter. So that was one of the elements that we saw there. As it relates to kind of what we were seeing with elevated care costs for COVID, what we saw in the fourth quarter in particular in December. Overall, we've been noticing is that COVID admits for inpatient stays are running a higher cost per case than we traditionally saw. That actually kind of makes some sense. There are more intense cases typically that are going into inpatient stay. I will say we did notice in December that the total level of COVID admits were probably 50% to 60% above the October-November average that we had seen. So that was kind of the highest part of the year in terms of COVID inpatient admits. If I take those elements and sum together, that then more than accounts for the 10 basis points differential in our full-year view, Justin. As that pertains to your second question, as we look out into the next year and what we see in terms of patterns, I would call it patterns commensurate, kind of, with what we saw this year in terms of just the movement, with this kind of 84% view that we view for the full-year. As I step back and reflect and just kind of thinking about where -- broadly where the analyst consensus is, you picked particularly the 1Q. It's kind of in the right -- it looks like an appropriate zone in terms of staked out there for what one would expect. So thank you, Justin.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. John, thank you. And Justin, thanks for the question. Appreciate that. Next question, please operator.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Can you describe the competitive environment for Medicare Advantage? And I'm specifically thinking about how you've adjusted benefits in 2024 as part of a three-year process? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you're trying to adjust for the majority of the risk model changes in one fell swoop. And I'm curious how you think that plays out and positions you not just for \u201824, but then for \u201825 and \u201826 as well?\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Josh, thank you so much. Before I ask Tim Noel to give you more detail on your question, I mean, listen, I think the way we've looked at the shift in the rate notice is, it is a three-year set of adjustments, and that's why we've been very thoughtful about how we've planned, not just, frankly benefit design, but how we continue to accelerate our management of OpEx through the organization, how we continue to focus on eliminating unnecessary care and waste within the system through our various medical management capabilities. So it's really a three-pronged set of agendas, which we're going to be focused on over the next three years. And we've been very thoughtful about making sure that we are setting those tables in a way which we can be sustainable on through this cycle, so that we're not taking sharp left turns or right turns halfway through the period. With that kind of overall perspective, maybe I ask Tim to give you a little bit more deep dive on the competitive environment and how he is very specifically planning for this.\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks, Josh, for the question. So I agree with Andrew's comments and a couple of things to start with is, there's been a number of changes to the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs, over the last 18-months to two years that are really phasing in over multiple years. And as we plan for 2024, we once again took a very rational view to the environment and also a long-term view with always our overarching goal being benefit stability for our members. As we stepped into -- as we step into benefit planning in future years, we really feel like we have got a very thoughtful way to respond to all of those changes that will be encountered by the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs into 2025 and beyond. And certainly as we look forward, we don't believe that we have any material pricing catch up to do in future periods and feel like we've got a very thoughtful response to the changes that will be encountered by the program into 2025 and 2026. So we think the forward view of our competitive outlook is quite solid and quite strong as we think about growth over the long-term.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you very much. Next question, please operator.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just, I apologize, it's sort of granular, but we're getting asked a lot of questions about it. The two metrics, days claims payable down a couple of days year-to-year sequentially, some from third quarter. And then the prior period development being down $100 million, maybe accounts for some of the variance on MLR, I'm guessing. I don't know if that's what you were guiding for when you updated -- last updated your outlook, but any comment on that as well?\nAndrew Witty: Let me ask John to address that A.J., thank you.\nJohn Rex: Yes. Good morning, A.J. So first on the days claims payable, so 2.8 day sequential decline, two days year-over-year. So primarily the single largest factor would be exactly what you pointed to, the change in prior period development. So that has a significant impact, if you look about the year ago where we were in prior period development and where we were even the 3Q. So the significant impact on that part, that'd be the main factor. In terms of other contributing factors that we saw, we did see in the fourth quarter some modest acceleration in provider claim submission timing. So just speed up in terms of those submissions, how quickly we're receiving them from data service in terms of receipt. We also noted that as it related to the fourth quarter some higher claims intensity in the first part of the quarter, particularly October. So that's a factor that impacts the denominator, Medex per day in the day's claims payable metric. And that was a piece that was in that also. As it relates to the $100 million of unfavorable medical development in the quarter, put that mostly, the items that we were talking about in my response to Justin's question. So the respiratory-related activity that we saw in there, the modestly higher cost per case for inpatient, COVID admits, really kind of those were the main factors that we had in there in terms of contributing to the unfavorable development. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: It's a good question, A.J. And as John just said, even back in the sort of second-half of Q3, we saw -- we've seen subsequently that this RSV pickup and this phenomena of more services being delivered around the vaccination was already starting as we were rolling out through Q3, which is really what explains that. So in many ways, this kind of Q3 issue, kind of, Q3 issue of negative development and then this slight pressure at the end of the year, it's kind of the same story, and which is why we don't feel it has any real direct relevance in terms of thinking through 2024. Thanks for the question, though. I appreciate that. Next question, please operator.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. I want to go to Optum Health and just maybe talk about the medical cost trend there. John, just going specifically to the comments that you made, did you see something similar in Optum Health or we see anything different there? And then also, I just want to understand the claim lag there. We've heard from some others that there can be a pretty big claim lag when we think about the providers versus the payers?\nAndrew Witty: So let me ask John to start and then maybe ask Heather to make a couple of comments on the claim dynamic. Go ahead, John.\nJohn Rex: Yes, Lisa. So definitely kind of seeing seniors obtaining RSV vaccinations and some of the respiratory activity that was going on in the quarter. So broadly similar features. For Optum Health, one of the comments that we've made throughout the year, though, also has to do with the progression here of taking on a large block of new membership. So we took on about 900,000 new members as we started the year. And one of the comments we've made throughout the year is engaging with these members, because the most important thing we need to do is have the clinical engagement with these members in terms of start improving their health outcomes, getting them and to see physicians, having our clinicians interacting -- having -- interacting with them. And it's a comment we've made throughout the years, we've seen the Optum Health margin progression, so one of the great things. We probably started the year at kind of roughly at 20% engagement level with that 900,000-member block. We exit the year having engaged with about 80% of these members. Super important factor as we think about Optum Health, as we think about 2024 and how -- and that progression. And that's been a big focus of the team at Optum Health all year long of getting that engagement in. So we can have impact on their health. But far and away, especially given what this population is like, they typically have complex needs, that's important. Another really important market as it relates to the new membership patients that we're bringing into Optum Health for 2024 again. So I talked about that 20% engagement level we started '23 with. For 2024, we're going to start at a 50% engagement level with that new membership. So we're making advances in that and that's exactly what you should expect from the team. Their efforts have been really strong.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, John. Maybe, Heather, you could comment on Lisa's question around claims, and then I'd like to ask Amar also to follow up on your perspective on engagement and what's driving that. Please go ahead, Heather.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. So the only thing -- the thing I would add to, so I appreciate, on top of John's point, when you think about engaging the patient early, then it's really in the clinician's hands. And I think about the way we think about our clinicians is that importance to your point about visibility than to kind of action. And the way we think about our clinicians is, once we get that engagement, and as John said, early engagement is so important, then our clinicians having the tools, and I think we've been -- what's really essential for us is those 130,000 clinicians having visibility early, what to do next. And the first thing is that they've got the technology, they've got solutions around them, they've got referral management practices that they can engage with high-quality specialists when they need to for outpatient procedures. And then that they've got the supports in behavioral health and the home and community-based -- home and community services that we've been investing heavily in over the last year. And then the last thing I would point to is the contract protections that we've been focused on with our payers, to be sure that the structures are in place so that our clinicians can practice in a responsible way. They have got visibility into the dynamics that are happening with the patients, and then they've got the support in place with the payers.\nAndrew Witty: Amar?\nAmar Desai: Yes, thanks for that question. Look, I think I'd reiterate the point around our highest risk complex members, where we're engaging at a 2 times higher rate than the same time last year. And within engagement and our clinical programs, I'd focus around referral management and high-value evidence-based medicine programs, including our optimal care program, where a majority of our clinicians are engaged with these evidence-based programs are able to get patients the care that they need. And importantly, get the support with the provision of wraparound services, including specifically home-based services, so that the highest risk groups have their care connected from the primary care setting into the home. Thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Amar, thanks. And John, maybe just to tie up the whole question.\nJohn Rex: Yes, and Lisa, tying up just on the last part of your question here regarding visibility into care activity claims like, no -- we don't -- that's not a factor. Just given the model of Amar's business and how those groups run, we -- frankly, it's one of the areas where we get probably early sensing mechanisms in terms of the care activity that's going on, is one of the early sensing mechanisms from much earlier in the year when we were able to talk about what we were seeing in these senior populations and the care activity within these orthopedic and other procedures. So that's not a factor. In fact, if anything, it's probably a strength of the organization.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Thanks, John. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question. And we obviously just spent a couple of minutes there talking about engagement, and I hope that gave you a strong sense of some of the progress we've made over the last 12 months in this area. I would say we're night and day in a different position today than we were a year ago in terms of our ability to be engaged with these complex patients making sure our physicians are ready to go, that's a really important aspect of what's building our confidence for 2024. And make no apology for just spending a couple more minutes, making sure you hear some of the great work that's gone on over the last year to ensure that we've got these very high levels of engagement and real substance behind that engagement. So that these patients will be supported and managed really positively going through '24. That's what then underpins and unlocks the whole opportunity of value based care for Optum Health. Lisa, thank you for your question. And I'll move on to the next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little about what you're seeing for cost performance in the group commercial or exchange or Medicaid businesses? As you step back, is this still appropriate to attribute all the pressure really, you've seen in 2023 to seniors or should we be mindful of anything else there? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Stephen, thanks so much. Maybe I ask Brian just to give you a kind of overarching summary of what UHC has seen in its different books of business, Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Yes, I appreciate that. Thanks, Stephen, for the question. And I think I'll just lead with, I feel really good not only about how we finished the year in UnitedHealth Care 2023, growth at the top end of our ranges, performance run in positions across the board, but also as we step into the businesses for 2024, feel very good about the key assumptions that underpin our plan and very optimistic. And you mentioned a couple of areas. You're right, as we've discussed some of these elements with respect to cost trend, they are centered in our senior community. And I think the message around those other businesses, nothing to see here and really aligned with our expectations, some good stability and durability in the underlying elements, both utilization and unit cost of our trend outlook and obviously feel very confident in how we're showing up competitively when you look at our growth outlook. So very optimistic about UnitedHealthcare, durability in those other lines that you're suggesting and a lot to look forward to here in the year.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thanks, Brian. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Great, thanks. Can you talk a little bit about Optum Rx, the drivers of growth in the quarter, in particular topline? And then if you could comment a little on revenue per Rx? And do you have any programs that either in the fourth quarter or in '24 that you've been rolling out that are capturing some of the increased demand on topics like GLP-1s that might be contributors to some of the strong performance? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Lance, thanks so much for the question. Before I ask Patrick to start the response on Optum Rx. First off, I just want to note a super strong selling year for us in Optum Rx, probably our best ever. Extraordinary and across a wide range of categories, plans, public service states, as well as obviously commercial. And really, really pleased with the differentiated product offering, really built on transparency, choice, and of course cost. And so we feel we've built a strong momentum in \u201823, rolling into \u201824. Patrick, you may want to go a little deeper, maybe share a little detail on weight engaged, specifically around the question that Lance raised around GLPs?\nPatrick Conway: Yes, thanks, Lance, for the question. So, as Andrew said, really diverse growth, both new business and high retention rates. So one of our best-selling years ever. I'd also call out the pharmacy services expansion, the organic growth there across the diverse set of pharmacy services, cost management. And then last, as you mentioned, new products and services, just to call out one weight engaged. So comprehensive management, medication, provider support, client support, lifestyle modification, digital, so a comprehensive solution across Optum, not just Optum Rx, partnering with Optum Health and Optum Insights. Already live with clients and robust interest in the marketplace, because patients, members, employers want comprehensive solutions that demonstrate better health outcomes at lower total cost of care.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Patrick. And Lance, thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I guess, I'm still just struggling with the concept of 2023 coming in worse, but this having no impact on the 2024 outlook. I mean, are you saying that the incremental pressure is really just like flu RSV and therefore unlikely to replicate at these levels next year, because the negative development speaks to costs earlier in the year also coming in worse, which implies that the baseline is -- the core baseline is also higher. So can you just help me reconcile, you know, why this isn't raising the base for next year and I guess within that you may feel confident with the guidance range for MLR, but is there reason to be at the higher end of the range to start the year or is the midpoint still where you're orienting? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: So I'll ask John to go a little deeper. Obviously, as you know, Kevin, we've set an MLR target next year, which is in fact higher than the actual closeout for this year in any case, which takes into consideration some of that kind of elevation, which we've seen throughout the year. So I'm going to call it the core elevation associated with the outpatient senior behaviors that we've been talking about now for several quarters. And then as we've talked a little bit already, this end of Q4 type of a small seasonality variation, we don't think is really durable or relevant to the rest of the year. But John, maybe go a little deeper on that.\nJohn Rex: Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So yes, so the elements that contributed to the unfavorable development being around respiratory activity that was going on as the seniors came in to get vaccines, another care was being delivered and such. And that higher inpatient cost per case for the COVID admits that we're seeing. So those would largely be the prime contributors of the elements that we are seeing here in terms of that unfavourability. So you're absolutely correct in your assumption. That doesn't impact our run-in assumption as we think about our outlook for 2024, and which -- so keeps us right squarely in where we thought we'd be as we were at our investor conference, is taking out the 84% plus/minus 50 basis points. Really as we look across the scope of our businesses and we think reflect on how we performed in \u201920 and in \u201823, the scope of it being very much with what we saw back in mid-year of 2023, that this is -- that the running factors are about outpatient care activity among senior populations, which we incorporated into our bids. The elements that you're appropriately referring to in 4Q, again, not factors impacting our view at all in terms of how we staked out \u201824 and how we expect to perform in \u201824. Really good question.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. And I'd also just add, I mean, as you would fully expect, Kevin, we're reviewing the leading indicators of care activity, frankly, daily, weekly, monthly and have been all year. And we've also been investing significantly in increasing numbers of early warning signals, if I can put it that way, to strengthen our radar capability to see this. And I can tell you, we're really not seeing any deviation from what we've been telling you all year in terms of the core activities across the system. The seasonal bumps at the end of the year, obviously, a little different. But in terms of outpatient utilization, all of those lines of activity that we've been discussing at different times with you, the patterns there, very supportive of how we've stepped out for '24. Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. I was hoping to just hop back over to Optum Health for a second. And just as it relates, one, to the margin targets that you gave us at Investor Day for the 7.7% to 8%, just want to see if those are still the appropriate targets for 2024? And then maybe if we could walk through the sort of pacing exercise with OH margins, given the expected step-up from the exit rate in the fourth quarter, how you're thinking about those OH margins for 1Q, and then sort of pacing over the course of the year? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Dr. Desai to make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to talk about where we've staked out for Optum Health next year. A ton of work done during 2023 to strengthen the business. You saw that beginning to show through as we roll through the second-half. We continue to expect that to be a very strong driver of improvement as we go into 2024. A lot of that work we talked about already today around engagement is a key element of our confidence in being able to build our profile of that business. And Amar, maybe you could go a little deeper, and then John can close out with discussing on the progression.\nAmar Desai: Thanks for the question, Scott. We're confident in our 7.7% to 8.0% target for 2024. We've discussed engagement in detail. The second important piece is our medical management programs, which we've scaled effectively. I talked a little bit about OptumCare and evidence-based guidelines. What I would reiterate is the work we're doing across our network with payment integrity. Again, with the idea of being able to provide the right support services across our network. The last piece I would also hit on is our initiatives around OpEx, which have been progressing well and are on track, driving operating efficiencies and G&A discipline across the organization. And it really with focus on more consistency in our systems and unification of our operating platform. So we feel very good about the 7.7% to 8.0% as we go into '24. A - Andrew Witty Great. Thanks so much, Amar. John?\nJohn Rex: Yes, Scott. Good morning. So as Amar said, feel very good about where we established our margin objectives for 2024. The element super important here is, again, how these new patient cohorts progress as they come into our business, and we're able to engage with them clinically and improve their health outcomes, make sure we're able to close care gaps. And the progress that Amar and teams accomplished during 2023 in terms of getting those engagement levels will assist a lot in terms of the health of the people that we're serving here, and then particularly, this cohort from 2023 to 900,000 new patients that we're able to serve and how that business performs over the course of the year. So that's a big step into it. Another big step into it is this group of 750,000 new patients that came on to the business. The fact that we were able to. Yet engagement level is significantly higher than we were at last year, where the new cohort will help also. So it gives us a lot of confidence in where we're stepping out in terms of serving these people throughout the course of the coming year. In terms of your comment, you'd expect them typical than seasonality factors to weigh in how the quarters performed. So much more think about that as seasonality factors, so they're probably having impact here. So typical in terms of seasonal factors that we would have experienced this year, starting with a stronger base that sets us up well to reach our targets.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thanks, John. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So a question on Optum Rx. Over the past year, there's been some evolving dynamics around -- news flow around the regulatory changes for PBMs unbundling. There were some news flow there as well as pharmacy reimbursement model changes, such as cost plus type of approach? I guess how are you thinking about potential implications of some of these dynamics, if any at all? And do these dynamics have a material impact on Optum Rx? Or how are you thinking about those profit drivers remaining intact kind of going forward for the PBM? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Erin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather to give you some comments there. As you know, Heather's been very, very involved with the various legislative processes, and it'd good to get her perspective on that.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. Thanks. So maybe just quickly, I'll say, completely respectful of the evolving dynamic and just make the headline that our business is incredibly dynamic. I'd be remiss if I don't say, again, at this juncture, that we continue to engage because it's incredibly important to note that in a space where affordable drugs -- affordable prescription drugs to consumers is on everybody's mind, including ours, and that's what the PBM is built to do. We are really pressing to make sure that policymakers understand that it's important to preserve choice for clients. It's important to make sure that we preserve value-based structures, because we know that value base is the way to ensure that we deliver lower price -- lower-cost drugs. And we can't break that alignment of incentives where PBMs work with payers to reduce costs. And that it is incredibly important that discounts remain, because there's no indication that rebates drive list prices up. The PBMs work as a counterweight against high drug cost. That being said, you've seen in our model held diverse the business is. And across Optum Rx, across the PBM, across the pharmacy services, it's a multitude of businesses. And we really listen to our clients. We exist on behalf of our clients, and we compete in a highly competitive market. And we win because our model translates. It translates in transparency, it translates in innovation and it translates in partnership to our clients. So we'll follow the client will be incredibly respectful of the legislation, but I feel really good that we act quickly, we act responsibly, and we work towards value. And you see that in the results. You see that in the growth. But most importantly, you see that in the client validation of the model. So I feel good about where we're positioned. I feel good about the experience in 2023 as a guide to that, but really confident in the growth in \u201824.\nAndrew Witty: Heather, thanks so much. And Erin, thanks very much for the question. I'm sure there'll continue to be debate around this area. High drug cost, of course, is a big issue for everybody. First and foremost, we need to see list prices come down. That's the most important thing that can make a big difference here. I would say that as you look at all the different ideas, which float up from time-to-time around reform in this area, there really isn't anything that we don't offer in some form or fashion to our clients and our customers. And the reality is we think that's the right position. We think we should be offering a portfolio of different tools, different product designs, which allows people to choose what's right for them. Because what a state wants, what a union wants, what a corporation wants differs. And it's super important that their views are taken into account here. We believe we do that well in the diversity of our product offering, and that's what's underpinning our record growth and it underpins our confidence for \u201824. Appreciate that, Erin. Next question?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the Medicare AEP enrollment that you talked about, the 100,000 lives that you added. I guess were there any differences in terms of what consumers responded to this year or differences in the retention rate relative to what you're expecting? And just can you help us think about the drivers of membership growth over the year as you needed to get to the guidance that you gave for the full-year?\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Tim Noel to give you that.\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks for the question, Nathan. So once again, the Medicare environment, selling environment is highly competitive. And we probably saw one of the more aggressive years of pricing that we've ever seen in the 2024 session. We guided at investor conference to growth of 450,000 to 550,000 lives, which is a little bit more modest than we have grown in past years, but it's reflective of our response to the new risk model changes, what we saw in outpatient utilization patterns early in '23 and reflecting that into 2024 pricing. And as we close out AEP, I would say that we were a little bit light against what we were thinking, kind of, end of November. Most of that actually is in the group business, some of the very aggressive benefits, a little bit more switching, drove some of our term rates a bit higher in AEP than we were initially thinking. But we still feel like we're going to have a much heavier weighting of our growth outside of the annual enrollment period from February to December. And this is really just a continuation of a trend that we have seen play out over the last five years really. And in fact, last year, we drove 430,000 lives of growth or about 60% of our total growth in the period from February to December. This is a portion of the selling season that we really do well in given our large dual footprint and also the fact that some of the selling and AEP tends to be focused on some of those headline benefits that have been really aggressively positioned. And throughout the remainder of the year, there tends to be some switching back as folks think more deeply about things like network, the fulfillment of supplemental benefits, overall service and delivery of product. So I guess the headline is it is a very aggressive marketplace this year. We feel like we're positioned really well for \u201825 and \u201826 on how we priced, and very pleased with what we've done so far and excited about our opportunity, once again, to have a really great growth in the selling period from February to December of \u201824.\nAndrew Witty: Right, Tim. Thanks so much. Last question, please operator.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions has been asked. I'll throw this one out, too. We've been seeing more articles about health system just dropping their MA contracts, some of those articles sites, United I know -- historically, most of these types of contracts that, you know, conflicts that make the press historically ultimately come to terms, so I'm just wondering, is this just a media threat? Or do you think there's something more measurable happening here with your health system partners?\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Gary, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to respond to that.\nBrian Thompson: Hey Gary, thanks for the question. I would say, overall, the disruptions that we see in the market this year are, I would say, at/or even lower than historical comparisons on average, leaving 2023. I will say though that any disruption for our consumers is too much. They come to rely on an in-network provider relationship. They have a coverage expectation from their health plan. So we obviously want to avoid that type of network disruption. And we, however, do need to balance that ambition with affordability. Now as we speak specifically to the Medicare Advantage space, we did have some deals that came down to the wire. And I do think that had some impact on AEP. And again, going to Tim's commentary around our confidence February forward, where we have those deals intact, I think you'll see that response in our growth as well. But again, on average, really not much change overall compared to historical periods on disruption.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. No, it's well said, Brian. And I think, obviously, Gary, we -- what you seen on behalf of patients, on behalf of government to make sure that we're getting the very best cost associated for the care delivered. And it's important that, that negotiation is robust. And the good news is that the overwhelming majority get resolved. We really don't like to see disruption happen. Unfortunately, occasionally, it does. But rest assured, we're making good progress in this area. As Brian said, no real kind of difference in outcome to what we've seen in previous years. With all of that, let me say thank you for all of your questions. Very much appreciated. And as you've heard, we're confident in our mission, focused on our growth pillars, delivering innovation that matters and disciplined in our operations and in our approach to the market. And we look forward to delivering on our commitments in 2024 to our customers, patients and shareholders. Very much appreciate your attention this morning. Thank you, and look forward to talking with you between calls. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-13 11:30:23", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earning reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated October 13, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter results we reported today reflect well-balanced and durable growth, supported by disciplined execution, and a steadfast commitment to ensure high quality comprehensive care is well within reach for every person we're privileged to serve. Evolution in our marketplace, including regulatory changes, means agility and adaptability must continue to be defining characteristics of our company. The people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare continuously strive to find new ways to innovate, serve, and grow. As a direct result of their mission-driven focus, this year we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022. By the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at OptumHealth, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on OptumRx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year. The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models. This year, we expect OptumHealth will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources, and until now often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need. Ramping up to engage these patients requires significant upfront investment and high touch reach. These early efforts ensure we can address patients\u2019 unique needs and design personalized care plans that drive better health outcomes, increase quality of life, and deliver cost savings throughout the health system. Making investments to serve people, who have endured far too many barriers to care is an easy choice for us all. In 2023, you have seen both our commitment and financial capacity to invest to further enable our ability to serve and to grow far into the future. In recent years, we've invested significant resources in building our capabilities to care for people most effectively for the life or health stage they find themselves in, whether they need preventative or palliative care or are best served in a clinic at home or virtually. In particular, we're advancing our ability to care for people in their homes and integrating that physical care with our pharmacy and behavioral offerings. This work means developing an even more versatile clinical workforce to serve consumers in more ways through clinic-based Optum care delivery capabilities and extending our reach to consumers, who may not have ready access to physical clinics. Medicare Advantage continues to be a powerful force in driving superior health outcomes for consumers and in helping to lower costs at the system level. Today, about half of all seniors in the U.S. have chosen Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare, and that number will continue to expand for very good reasons. The results are well documented. Medicare Advantage outperforms traditional fee-for-service for seniors on many measures, including lower rates of hospitalization. And they spend up to 45% less out of pocket, compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. Importantly, this high value for consumers is delivered at a lower cost to the health system. UnitedHealthcare serves more people in high quality, four-star and higher Medicare Advantage plans than any other organization. Looking to the 2024 enrollment period, which begins Sunday, we're confident our offerings will again resonate with consumers as they prioritize high-quality care and stable benefits. In the reduced funding environment health plans face, I credit our teams for investing in the areas consumers value most, including zero-dollar premium plans, no copays for primary, virtual, and preventative care, and no copays for 100s of the most commonly prescribed drugs. I want to highlight one more aspect of our growth story, the consistently strong performance of our pharmacy businesses. Pharmacy, as you know, is the most common consumer touch point in healthcare. What consumers and employers want more than anything is access to the most effective treatments in the moment they need them for the lowest possible cost. OptumRx is delivering on those expectations. This most recent selling season is on track to be among our strongest, reflecting a combination of new clients and retention rates in the very high-90s. And as the coming season for 2025 develops, we're expecting another year of robust growth. Our clients tell us they value the enhancements we are making to our pharmacy offerings, providing them transparency and choice, while also integrating new tools and capabilities. Notably, our pharmacy service offerings go far beyond the foundational benefit management capabilities and now account for about half of all OptumRx revenues. We continue to expand the reach of our community pharmacies and our diverse specialty and infusion offerings are growing double-digits. Driving this expanding market demand is the enormous pressure facing employers, health plans, governments and others to manage and respond to manufacturer list pricing. The services offered by OptumRx and others are the only counterbalance to drug company pricing. The foundational business objectives for PBMs is to lower costs and make medicines more affordable and accessible for individuals and families. PBMs are the only entities in the drug supply chain with that exclusive focus and incentive, and we're honored to play this critical role. These pillars of our growth, value-based care, pharmacy, and our innovative benefits businesses, alongside our health technology and financial service capabilities, underpin our ability to develop ever stronger value propositions for the people, who receive and those who pay for care and support our confidence in a future of growth. And with that, I'll pass it to Dirk McMahon, our President and COO.\nDirk McMahon: Thanks, Andrew. I recently hosted UnitedHealthcare's National Accounts Forum, where we bring together client leaders twice a year to share ideas and gather feedback. These are some of the biggest and most sophisticated companies in America that collectively employ and sponsor coverage for millions of people. And to no surprise, healthcare costs top their list of concerns, especially the rising cost of drugs. In addition, they want innovation, new tools to help their employees take full advantage of their benefits, achieve better health outcomes, and save money. And of course, it has to be digital. Let me offer a few examples of innovation that have fueled our growth outlook, starting with our mobile platform, the primary access point for millions of UHC members. Each year, we had new capabilities to provide consumers with increased on-demand care access, highly personalized information about their benefits, real-time support, cost estimation tools, integrated pharmacy capabilities, and enhanced rewards. Another example, our newest and fastest growing commercial offerings, which feature no annual deductibles and incentivize people to make good healthcare choices by offering an unprecedented view into quality and cost. When seeking care options, consumers see potential care providers' latest reviews and quality designations, and they see what they will actually pay for their care, which will help them make the most informed decisions. UnitedHealthcare members in these offerings are receiving more preventative care, while paying about 50% less out of pocket, compared to people enrolled in traditional offerings. And their employers can reduce the total cost of care with an average savings of 11%. These results are why such new offerings are among our fastest growing. Beyond these consumer-facing innovations, we're leveraging the latest technologies to create greater operational capacity and productivity, so we can better serve consumers and focus on the highest value work. Our teams are significantly improving how quickly we respond to the millions of benefit questions we receive each year. We are using AI and natural language processing to expedite call documentation, to rapidly generate accurate summaries of consumer interactions with our contact centers, saving millions of dollars in administrative work and freeing up capacity for our people to prioritize engagement. We're also utilizing these technologies to translate and interpret unstructured data, such as physician notes, which will help, for example, provide deeper insights for life sciences customers, so they can better assess the efficacy of their treatments. Of course, these are just a few of the 100s of AI applications powered by OptumInsight we are actively developing, testing, and deploying today to further elevate the consumer and care provider experience, while driving increased quality and lower costs. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. The growth we reported today is a direct result of investments made over many years to develop and connect the diverse health capabilities needed to serve the people, who rely on us each day, while also creating the foundational capacity to serve millions more in the years ahead. This capability development has long been in the making, and it's still very much underway as the opportunities to serve more people, more deeply continue to expand. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer a few brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with the view we shared during the second quarter, with activity levels still led by outpatient care for seniors, and still most notably in the orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories. These trends remain stable at the levels we previously described. As we've noted, our outlook assumes these activity levels persist throughout next year. We continuously monitor a broad spectrum of patient acuity levels and have yet to see any other notable changes. For example, within oncology, the average stage at which we are first seeing cancer diagnosis remains consistent with historical patterns. As always, we remain diligent in looking for changes to the underlying health of patients. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Revenues of $92.4 billion grew by 14% over the prior year, with double-digit growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum Health revenues grew by 29% approaching $24 billion, driven by an increase in the number of care services we offer and patients we serve, especially for those with complex care needs. Operating margins continue to reflect the initial clinical engagement activities that support the strong growth in patients we have realized this year, as well as the higher care activity patterns we have discussed. OptumRx revenues grew by 14%, approaching $29 billion, driven by the strength in our pharmacy care services offerings, as well as new customer wins. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects customer response to our innovative solutions, which focus on choice and lowest net cost. OptumInsight revenues grew by 35% to $5 billion. Revenue backlog of over $31 billion increased by more than $7 billion, in part due to the change healthcare combination. In addition, we recently announced a partnership to provide revenue cycle, analytics, and information technology services to a health system serving more than 400,000 people in the Midwest. Turning to UnitedHealthcare, our commercial business added nearly 700,000 people through the third quarter. Further, selling season indications are tracking favorably, particularly in national accounts. So as \u201824 begins, we expect to grow to serve an additional 1 million people with commercial benefits. Within our public sector programs, we expect growth of nearly 1 million Medicare Advantage members this year. And looking to the year ahead, we're encouraged by the consumer value, stability, and breadth of our offerings. And as always, we start with an expectation that we will outpace overall market growth. Our Medicaid performance remains strong as we support people and families through the redeterminations process. Our teams are really leaning in, speaking with 1,000s of consumers each day. Through a comprehensive Outreach Program, we are helping people navigate the process and connecting them with the resources they need to retain or reinstate their health benefits or to help them find other affordable coverages. A significant majority of the people we engage with are able to retain or reinstate their coverage. Our capital capacities remain strong. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted cash flows from operations were at $22.4 billion or 1.3 times net income. And in that same timeframe, we returned over $11.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As noted, given the strength of our business performance, this morning we have updated our \u201823 outlook for adjusted earnings to $24.85 to $25 per share. And as we finish strongly in \u201823 and look forward to \u201824, we're intensely focused on execution, while further expanding our capacity to serve more people, more deeply, and building the foundations to support our growth objectives for years to come. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. Before opening up for questions, I'll offer some preliminary observations about next year, while reserving most of this conversation for our investor conference on November 29th. Our businesses continue to build momentum, while maintaining flexibility and adaptability for an ever-changing landscape, even as we invest for the future. We're focused on our strategic growth pillars and driving efficiencies throughout the enterprise at an accelerated pace. At this distance, analyst earnings estimates for 2024 reasonably reflect the performance view we expect to offer in November, with consensus near the upper end of our likely initial outlook range. Importantly, the growth we're realizing today and our expanding capacity serve to further reinforce the confidence we have in our long-term 13% to 16% growth objective. And with that, I'll now ask the operator to open up for questions.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Good morning, and thanks for the comments. I wanted to start with GLP-1s and really understand from two sides. One, when we think about rates for 2024, can you talk about what you've incorporated in rates around GLP-1s, especially around weight loss as we have new products coming to the market? And how do I think about that from the PBM side when we think about the services that you can wrap around that and sell from a PBM perspective?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. In a second, I'll ask Brian Thompson from UHC and Dr. Patrick Conway to respond to your comments in a little more detail. But let me just preface all of that. You know, the thing we're most overall focused on in GLP-1 space is honestly the pricing. You know, we're very positive about the potential for another tool in the toolbox to help folks manage their weight. We recognize that has potential benefits, but we're struggling and frankly our clients are struggling with the list prices, which have been demanded of these products in the U.S., which are running at about 10 times the level of price which have been paid in Western Europe. So, overall, I'd say that is our focus, is to try and find a way to make this a sustainable and affordable space for our clients to support. With that said, let me ask Brian to give you a perspective from UHC and how they've incorporated this in their forward view?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. Thanks for the question there, Lisa. First, to put in context GLP-1 is over 80% on the diabetic side. So as we think about weight loss, up to maybe 20% of our total spend and it's largely performing in line with what we had planned as we went into \u201823. And we feel very confident and comfortable about how we're looking at that going forward into \u201824. As you think about it, keep in mind, the vast majority of the coverage here is in our fee-based business, that's our self-employed customers and that's still at less than a third, around 30% of our book. As we look forward, are our customers considering to cover more or less? I would say it's a mixed bag, some are seeking coverage albeit dissatisfied with the price points. Some are backing off given the cost, but I wouldn't really be directional one way or the other on whether or not we're seeing more or less coverage on the weightless side as we look forward. But again, to Andrew's point, beyond just getting to the obvious lower price points, we're really trying to work with manufacturers to get to some aligned value-based constructs, getting pricing to a point where it's based on outcomes and adherence levels, all the way to outright risk on utilization levels, and pairing those with therapies and programs that can put less reliance on lifelong adherence requirements like these drugs currently have. We're not there yet. We're optimistic, but we can get there, but clearly price point is a key barrier.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And Patrick, maybe from the -- from OptumRx perspective, you could talk a little bit about the broader approaches we take?\nPatrick Conway: Thank you. As Andrew said, our customers, payers, employers, people we serve are concerned about the prices of GLP-1s as set by manufacturers. OptumRx will continue to negotiate lower prices through discounts over time, be transparent with our customers, and implement clinical evidence-based guidelines so the right people get appropriate medicines. And as you alluded to, Lisa, obesity and cardiometabolic disease is a major public issue -- health issue in the U.S. and across all of [Oxfam] (ph), we are developing and implementing comprehensive solutions of which medicines are only a part of on behalf of our clients and people we serve to drive better health outcomes for all and value to the health system.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Patrick. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Next question, please, Jennifer.\nOperator: Yes, we'll go next to A.J. Rice with [UBS] (ph).\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. You know, it's similar to last quarter, the trend in margin and OptumHealth and OptumInsight has been down year-to-year, you know, you've called out change, particularly with OptumInsight, but I wondered if there's any ability to discuss unusual items, non-recurring items. I know you said you had some cost reduction programs you were implementing this quarter in OptumHealth. Did those impact the results? And is there any change as you look ahead to \u201824 in your margin expectations or targets for those two businesses?\nAndrew Witty: A.J., thanks so much for the question, appreciate it. So let me just make a few comments, particularly as it speaks to the OptumHealth part of the question that you raised. So as you look at 2023, essentially what we've seen, and we refer to this in Q2, greater growth in the number of people, patients, that we've been privileged to serve this year, particularly the more complex patients. So very strong, and you heard in our opening commentary, very strong growth in the number of fully accountable lives running at about 900,000, substantial fraction of that coming in the more complex cases. As I said back in the last call, we're very, very pleased to have that growth. We believe that is really foundational or key foundation for future long-term growth of the business. However, within that, the mix of that population is a little different to what we expected. That takes time to then build the engagement capabilities that we need to be able to work with those people and their care providers to ensure the very best care is delivered in the most efficient and effective way. And that's really the bulk of the investment that we're talking about. It's really taking the time, looking after those folks in the way they need to be looked after right now in advance of those being able to engage with them fully and deliver then the various interventions and advices that we can provide that we're really building throughout Optum to ensure that not just in one year, but over multiple years, those folks get increasingly better care delivery and better outcomes. And recall that these patients in many cases have really been somewhat, you know, not necessarily looked after, as well as they could have been by the system, because of their very complexity. In some cases, they're not able to get to clinics, which is why we've been building up our home care capabilities and other wraparound services to the classic clinic approach. That's really the driving force. Now, as that speaks to the future, two things really, A.J., one is we're super confident around our ability to continue to grow the number of patients, who are able to look after. Number two, as those capabilities that have been accelerated during this year begin to affect both the quality positively and the cost of how these patients' care is delivered, you're going to see that shine through an improved economic performance of OptumHealth. And as we look forward, we're very confident about continued strengthening of that business. Make no mistake, OptumHealth is having a very strong growth year and we're taking the opportunity this year to really ready ourselves and build strength for the next many years of that business. AJ, thanks so much for the question. Next question?\nOperator: Yes, we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Understanding that you expect Medicare Advantage to grow at a healthy pace, I think you said above market again in 2024. Could you speak to that progress expected at OptumHealth? I know we'll get details at the Investor Day, but how are you thinking about the transition of patients from sort of fee for service to these fully risk engagements and then maybe general levels of investment for growth in light of the risk model and reimbursement model changes?\nAndrew Witty: So Josh, thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously we'll leave very much the detail of the elements of the growth model for when we meet with you all in November. Having said that, we would no reason not to expect a continued healthy momentum in our move toward value-based care next year with continued high expectations for our ability to deliver that. To your broader question, maybe just reflect a little bit again on 2023. So this has been a year which essentially has been obviously very heavily influenced by the change in the funding environment that was announced earlier in the year for Medicare Advantage. And we're very appreciative of the three-year phasing of the changes, which CMS ultimately decided to make. But obviously, those changes are essentially the equivalent to a price cut phased in over three years for the Medicare Advantage program. We are appreciative of the fact that we have had essentially seven, eight, nine months warning of that in terms of when that was announced before we go into the \u201824 year. And that\u2019s allowed us and we have taken full advantage of it to really focus on how we ready ourselves, not just for 2024, but for the next 36 months. So 2023 has all for us been about ensuring that we re-engineer our cost base, that we refocused our benefit strategies to those things that matter most to patients, that we strengthen and invest in our ability to manage affordability of care going forward into the system, and that we're taking full advantage of building the capabilities we have already begun to construct around our consumer engagement, our technology, digital first capabilities, and ultimately doubling down on our commitment to value-based care. That has really been the story behind the investments of 2023 in response to the changes that have been signaled by CMS, so that we go into \u201824, \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 feeling strong, feeling that we've taken advantage of these last several months to ensure that we've adjusted and adapted our strategy and business in readiness for the change in the funding environment, which gives us strong confidence for next year and underpins our commitment to the signal I just gave you in terms of our potential for 2024. Next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Justin Lake with Wolf Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about UHC performance. First, your MLR was better than our expectations, but curious how it compared to your internal estimates? And maybe you could share how that might have come across -- come in across the three main business segments? And then quickly, on the third quarter UHC margins, I found it interesting that while the MLR deteriorated by 50 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, overall UHC margins actually improved by 50 basis points. So, curious what might have grown with that? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Justin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask John Rex to respond to the first part and then Brian Thompson, the second.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Justin. So, overall, I'd call it broadly consistent with our expectations in terms of the third quarter. So a few things I'd like to highlight though. So care patterns were, as we discussed, focused again on outpatients, outpatient activity with seniors, those continue at the levels we described during the second quarter. And that's what really drove a lot of kind of the activity throughout the quarter. It's still in those categories that we have been focused on. The sequential move that you see from second quarter to third quarter is largely a seasonal factor. As you know well, there's always less care activity in a third quarter, that has to do just with vacations, a lot of the elements that go in there in terms of certain types of discretionary care, seasonal illnesses, so typical patterns, and also Part-D patterns that you see on a regular basis. In fact, if you go back to the years prior to 2020, 3Q would typically be the lowest care ratio quarter. So I'd say it's probably more typical than not, just getting back to periods that were more normalized in terms of the activities that we saw going on there. We continue to expect our full-year medical care ratio to be toward the upper end of our initial 82.6 plus minus 50 basis point range. So very consistent with the level that we set out there back again in the two quarter that would be toward the upper end of that outlook. So -- and then the seasonal factors in the 3Q, that some of those things influencing where you'd expect to be in that fourth quarter, the final quarter of the calendar year. Certainly utilization, Part-D impacts, they move the other direction in a fourth quarter. So typical in that. That's amplified, of course, very much by the deductible wear off features that you see in a fourth quarter, influenza, RSV, all those patterns that come in. So we'd expect that to move the other direction here as we go into the 4Q.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, John. And Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Yes, John, I think you did a good job of explaining, sort of, the sequencing of the medical cost ratio. What I don't want to lose sight of is I think the key point is all of our businesses in UnitedHealthcare right now are really demonstrating innovation and market success at the same time. And you're seeing that come through in these margins, whether that's our complex care and health equity strategy in Medicaid, how we're showing up with broader service offerings and conveniences like UCard and URide, NMA to complement strong, stable core benefits or some of the innovations you heard around the commercial benefits in Dirk\u2019s opening remarks. This is really translating the type of growth and performance that I think you've come to expect from UnitedHealthCare, and I think it sets up a really nice baseline that I remain optimistic about as we look forward to 2024.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Brian and John. Next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the PBM business, obviously interest in alternative or maybe even experimental models has been a big area to-date, you know, the past quarter or so. I guess what are you hearing from your health plan employer clients on their degree of interest in doing something totally transformational in terms of how they manage those benefits? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hi, Stephen, thanks so much. Let me ask Patrick Conway to respond to that.\nPatrick Conway: Yes, so as we interact with our clients, employers, payers, and others, on this, first I'll note, a recent survey came out, approximately 90% of those clients are satisfied with their PBM. They're also satisfied with the level of transparency. Specifically for OptumRx, we will continue to innovate and provide additional solutions to our clients that are comprehensive, integrated and transparent. I'll call out one other area, transparency to the consumer. This has been a journey for us that we continue to drive transparency to the consumer. To call out one example with Price Edge, a product recently launched, that's providing consumers the most affordable medicine at the point of care. We are seeing millions of consumers access, use this tool as we provide it to them. And so you'll continue to see us to drive consumer transparency and innovative solutions to our clients.\nAndrew Witty: Right, Patrick, thanks so much. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Great, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the GLP-1 Class and I guess, you know, as we're starting to see more outcomes data for these drugs, do you see that changing, you know, employers willingness to cover this class given the potential long-term benefits and, you know, how you helping them think about potential ways to design the benefit to be able to manage that cost, which you guys talked about earlier being so much in focus for employers?\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. I mean, there's an old adage, which I quite like in this context, which is the innovation that is not affordable is not innovative. And that's really the key to all of this. Though I have no argument, I don't think anybody at UnitedHealth Group has any argument with the prospects and possibility for the future of this drug class. We recognize the need and nothing would make us happier, honestly, to be able to lean forward and see more and more folks take advantage of these sorts of opportunities. But ultimately it has to be affordable. And what we're hearing from our clients is they just -- they are really struggling to see how they embark on that journey of what they regard as a kind of open-ended financial risk. Now that's exactly why Brian earlier made the comments he did about we're trying to put forward to various manufacturers a variety of different options, but we need the manufacturers to move. It's as simple as that. And we remain extremely open-minded to any model that works. We're working with our clients to ensure that they understand the various options. But they are giving us very, very clear signals. They need our help to make this a more affordable proposition for their employees and their members. And we'll continue to lean into that. Thanks for the question, Nathan. Next question?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. [Indiscernible] if you can give us your updated thoughts on from this vantage point, what you're thinking about the trajectory of just overall wage inflation in healthcare? And how you're sort of planning for that? We have been seeing sort of moderation from the COVID peaks, but there certainly seems to be some pro-inflationary risks out there when thinking about some of the federal policy proposals, state proposals, and then obviously some of these Union actions too. So just curious on how you're thinking about wage inflation and health care moving forward and risks to that inflecting back upwards? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, absolutely. Thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dirk to give you a few comments on that.\nDirk McMahon: Yes, well, to start, what I would say is as we go out and we negotiate with various health systems for prices as we move forward, you know, one of the key things involved in those discussions is, you know, what wage inflation is and how it's impacting their costs. You know, as we sit here today, it's lucky that we sort of have three-year contracts, so it's muted a little bit. But what I would also say is, you know, we see a little bit of upward pressure on unit costs related to wages, but as I sit here today, it's not something that we haven't planning for and priced about. As I think about our own business, we haven't had trouble recruiting people such as nurses, clinicians. We've actually, you know, people really want to work for us and from a capacity perspective, one of the things as we've talked about our growth so far, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor capacity to manage all the risks that we take. And as a consequence, we do spend a lot of time looking at the market. And as I said, people want to come to work for us. They like the mission. They like the ability to transform healthcare. And we're pretty pleased with our ability to hire and manage our operations going forward.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Dirk. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about OptumHealth, I understand the commentary about membership coming in better, which creates a margin drag, but it feels like a couple of hundred thousand people, maybe low to mid-single-digit, more membership than you expected, causing margins to drop from 8% to 7% or 12%, essentially. Seems like a pretty big delta. So I assume there's other things going on in there beyond just digesting new membership growth. If not, then I guess we would know what the margin is on those new members. But is there anything else you would spike out there and how do we think about building back from where we are today to that 8% to 10% margin target? Is it simply about getting today's membership to target margins or is there a cost side? It seems like you're adjusting the labor force to some degree. Is there an MLR side? Is there a rate side? Any other color to kind of help us give visibility into the 8% to 10% over time? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So listen, by far and away the most important phenomena here are the things we've talked about to you already. So just to reiterate a little bit what we said to you back in Q2. So we've seen obviously the elevation in MLR which has stabilized, hasn't really come down, isn't accelerating up, but definitely is a phenomena year-over-year, number one, number two, increased behavioral care costs. Remember that within OptumHealth, our behavioral business is, that's where our behavioral business sits, and that has also seen significant increase year-over-year. We're very positive about that, because it's a signal that people are engaging in seeking help for their behavioral conditions. And we know that, that entwines very importantly with their ongoing medical costs. But nonetheless, it's an element of elevation. And then as you rightly reiterate, a piece of it is the growth in our value-based lives and the mix of those lives. And by mix, that means complexity mix, as well as geographic mix. And it takes, as I said already today, takes a little bit of time to build up the capabilities to allow us to engage properly with those folks at the level we want to. And we have really have -- we have not held back on doing that, Kevin, and that's really the bulk of the investment during this cycle where we've really lent into building those capabilities in readiness for the next, we hope, many years of serving these individuals higher and higher capability. You know, of course, and I made a comment earlier about re-engineering our cost base. Of course there are changes going on in our cost base across the whole organization, including OptumHealth in response to the change in pricing signals from CMS. But I would put those very much, kind of, secondary to the core elements I've just described. We're in a position obviously where we know exactly what these populations are that we're now looking after. That's been very much the basis of our forward views in terms of how we're starting to lay out for \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. And we feel very confident about our ability not only to grow as an organization, but to continue to strengthen margins back into the zone that you've historically been used to. Thanks so much, Kevin, for that and next question?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nSarah James: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to your comments on the strength in commercial growth and national accounts for next year. Can you give us a little bit of color on the pricing environment, given all the comments you've made on the moving pieces and cost trends, and then help us put into context that, and the broader economy with how your clients are thinking about product selection, either in breath or the type of products that they're purchasing from you in \u201924?\nAndrew Witty: Sarah, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dan Kueter, who looks after our commercial insurance business to answer that.\nDan Kueter: Yes, thanks, Andrew. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for the question. The growth that John mentioned in his comments is settled business in our national accounts fee-based segment. So we're very happy with how that's completed. We're pricing and negotiating our fully insured business for January right now, and we're comfortable with how that's materializing as well. Employers continue to focus on both affordability and innovation, and our innovative products continue to resonate significantly in the market, as Dirk highlighted in his comments. Thanks, Sarah.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Don. Next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll, the next two David Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to pivot to OptumInsight, you had commented in previous calls about a fairly heavy level of spending to integrate change and invest in that platform. I wondered if you could update us on any ongoing spend in that regard? What we should expect in terms of implementation on pro-health and kind of trajectory of margin in OptumInsight? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, David, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Roger Connor, who's our new CEO of OptumInsight to respond, Roger?\nRoger Connor: Thank you, and David, thank you for the question. First of all, just to say I'm delighted to be taking over the leadership of Insight. This is a pretty unique and special business. And getting to know the people, the products, and the offerings, I think we're going to make a real difference to healthcare. So excited about that future. Just specifically, David, on your question, the change integration\u2019s gone really well, to be honest. You'll see in the Q3 margin that we had the tail end of some of that spend to integrate, but the Q3 margin is in line with our expectations. I think it is worth understanding the longer term outlook for OptumInsight margin. We still believe that's in the region of 18% to 22%, that's really driven by the mix of the businesses. As you know, we're a business that has software, we have services, so there are different margins in there. But when you take what we've created with change and you look at the overall portfolio that we have, we have this incredible portfolio that is addressing everything from clinical decision support, we've got products for admin efficiency, we've got other products for payment optimization. You have that growth engine plus our innovation, plus that margin profile, we're very confident about the future performance of Insight.\nAndrew Witty: That's great. And I wonder whether Dan Schumacher, who's been very heavily involved in our various health systems partnerships, might just want to reflect a little bit on the question obviously was around pro-health, but rather than talking specifically, maybe just share a few thoughts about the overall evolution of those health system profiles and how they play out over the first couple of years.\nDan Schumacher: Sure, thanks Andrew. David, appreciate the question. Certainly our health system partnerships, you mentioned one that we've announced recently, it's a growing portfolio for us. Obviously, at the health system level, there's a lot of pressures. We've talked in earlier questions about wage inflation and so forth. And we have a unique opportunity to really be able to address some of those near-term challenges, while at the same time provide some capacity for future evolution of the system as they think about more digital capacities, greater outpatient catchment, as well as further engagement. So those are some of the things that we can help unlock for them and their migration to value-based care. So we're encouraged by the portfolio. It continues to grow. Actually, from the initial scope nine out of 10 have expanded from their initial scope. So continuing to grow, we're in the early days, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us.\nAndrew Witty: Dan, appreciate it and thanks so much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning. I would like to ask a GLP question more on the medical side. It sounds like right now price appears to be the greatest barrier for widespread adoption, assuming the outcome data continues to be positive. If pricing gets to a point that you view and your clients view as affordable. What do you think would be the long-term impact on care on the medical side? Are you seeing any near-term effects right now on MLR? I should say an MLR benefit. And do you think it would be reasonable to assume overall MLRs should decline with greater adoption of these drugs? And maybe what categories of health spend do you think or do you view would be the biggest opportunity going forward? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Ann, thanks so much for the question. I mean, I think honestly it\u2019s just way too early for us to be able to see anything like that, just in terms of, you know, obviously the weight loss indications are only just really coming into play. We haven't really been able to see, I'd say, anything from that perspective yet. And as I said earlier, the real focus for us right now is to try and figure out a way in which we can get to a position where the affordability of this class puts it in a zone where, you know, the people who need it can get it and can afford it. Nothing more to say on that, honestly. Next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.\nJohn Ransom: Hey, good morning. On your fully accountable lives, what's the expectation where you'll end up in the year with a number of medicare fully advantage lives? And just looking at the eliminations, is it fair to assume that a lot of those fully accountable lives are coming out of the UHC book? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: So thanks very much for the question. I'll ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads our OptumHealth Organization, just to comment a little bit on the, kind of, shape of the folks we look after there, and the degree to which they come from both UHC and obviously many of our external partners, Amar?\nAmar Desai: John, thanks very much for the question. We've had great growth in fully accountable membership as we mentioned earlier, adding over 900,000 patients for the year. That growth is diverse across a number of payers. We have over 100 payer partners spanning both national and regional payers. And as we think about that growth, of course, UnitedHealthcare is a core partner to us, but we continue to have the strength of our medical groups and physician networks being incredibly attractive to other payers regionally and nationally to be able to grow in their own value-based arrangements to drive outcomes and total cost of care. So we look forward to continued growth in a broad-based, diverse way. Thank you very much.\nAndrew Witty: Amar, thank you. And thank you for the question. Jennifer, I\u2019d say the last question now please.\nOperator: Okay, we'll go last to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Great. Thanks for taking the question. On Medicaid and Medicaid Redetermination, could you comment a little bit on the margin and implications of the members that are getting redetermined off? We've already seen a lot of double coverage or zero MOR on that? And then just in general, are enrollment -- disenrollment trends kind of consistent with your expectations and do you see where those members are going to as far as individual, employer, or uninsured? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Lance. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who leads our Community and State business to respond to that, Tim?\nTim Spilker: Yes. Thank you, Lance, for the question. And maybe I'll start with just the enrollment trends, because I think that really informs a whole number of factors. So first off, what we're seeing, I think, consistent with what states have reported is significant disenrollment for procedural reasons. And what's more, a lot of variability, frankly, across states in terms of the pacing and re-enrollment and even states now that are suspending terminations or re-enrolling members based on guidance. So those stops and starts certainly have an impact, you know, on our membership, as well as membership mix. But frankly, that's why we continue to develop even more ways to engage members and support our states. You know, our goal really is to help individuals find coverage and so a couple points on that. Our reach rate for the programs that we've implemented exceeds that of our traditional programs, and we're seeing strong re-enrollment rates between 15% and 20% depending on the state. And so as a result, as John mentioned in his comments, we're retaining a significant majority of the members we engage with, certainly more to do. And second, in terms of your question around just kind of outlook, again, I think the factors around the re-enrollment has an impact on just how we think about mix. But I think it's also important that to consider the rate environment. You know, states are taking into account a thoughtful, taking a thoughtful and data-driven approach to rate setting. And with visibility now into around 45% of our revenue for \u201824, really appreciative of the approach that states are taking. So all in all, I would say both membership, as well as our outlook is in line with what we expected at this point with a lot of variability. I think our membership looks good in terms of the outlook that we set at the beginning of the year. And at this point, I feel all of this is manageable.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And thank all of you for your time this morning. I hope what you heard during today's call only reinforces what you've come to expect from UnitedHealth Group, an organization that's just as nimble and agile as it is focused and disciplined, always growing, always innovating, ceaselessly committed to our mission and deeply devoted to those we share. Thank you for your attention today and we appreciate it.\nOperator: This does concludes today's conference.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earning reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated July 14, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, and good morning. And thank you all for joining us. As we discussed a number of weeks ago during the quarter, we saw a somewhat higher than usual range of movement in certain areas of care activity. As you'd expect, this inevitably impacted some elements of our business, but we overcame these dynamics with strength in other areas. Our second quarter performance reflects the capabilities, agility, and dedication of our people as they responded to the changes. As a team, we're confident in our ability to robustly grow in this fluid healthcare environment. Indeed, as I hope you saw in our release today, revenue growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across our enterprise increasing by more than $12 billion to nearly $93 billion. Let me provide a few highlights of our growth. First, the number of patients served by OptumHealth under fully accountable value-based care arrangements grew by more than 900,000 over this time last year. Among the new patients we welcomed, a significant number have complex needs. These people have serious health challenges, limited economic resources and often living communities where it can be difficult to access high quality care. Our ability to support their needs is distinctive and a direct result of the investments we have made to provide coordinated and comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and behavioral care, foundational capabilities that will help the patients we serve live healthier lives and drive growth far into the future. OptumRx and OptumInsight revenue grew double-digits on expanded capabilities and products that are generating new sales and opportunities. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s growth was strong and diversified as well. Today, we're serving nearly 1.6 million more people in our commercial and public sector program offerings than we did last year. This durable growth driven by our colleagues relentless focus on quality and execution enabled us to achieve second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.14 and to strengthen our full-year outlook to between $24.70 to $25 per share. We know there is great interest in understanding the recent care activity I just mentioned. So I'll give you an overview of how we're seeing care plans progress and how we're responding. I do want to underscore the most critical point first: making high quality care more affordable and accessible is at the core of our mission. Having more people obtaining the care they need is a positive trend for individuals and our health system and society. As we discussed several weeks ago, during the second quarter, we observed increased care patents, notably in outpatient surgeries for seniors and especially with certain orthopedic procedures, which may have been postponed. John will provide some additional detail on this later. As we look to 2024, we have developed compelling Medicare Advantage offerings. Our teams were, of course, thoughtful, both in our response to the CMS rate notice and in incorporating these care activity trends into our June benefit filings. Even in this challenging funding environment, we continue to prioritize the stability and affordability our members have come to rely on from UnitedHealthcare. We're confident that next year we will once again grow at a pace exceeding that of the broader market. While of a much lesser impact than senior outpatient care, we also are seeing increased care activity in behavioral. Over the past few years, behavioral care patterns have been accelerating as people increasingly feel comfortable seeking services. Just since last year, the percentage of people who are accessing behavioral care has increased by double-digits. From our perspective, it\u2019s an encouraging sign that more people are seeking help. Yet the ongoing shortage of qualified care providers has caused significant access challenges. To address the issue, OptumHealth has expanded its network by 10s of 1,000s of care professionals this year. And we are developing our benefit offerings, assuming demand for behavioral care services will continue to rise. OptumHealth\u2019s value-based care models are continuing to deliver especially strong and measurable results for people. Today serving more than 4 million patients and dozens of payers. OptumHealth and the patients and payers it serves share a common desire to seek improved health outcomes and experiences, while ultimately lowering the cost of care. And we're pleased to see more evidence supporting the efficacy of value-based care. Last month, researchers at Yale Medicine working in collaboration with Optum published a peer reviewed study about in-home visits, an important element in our value-based care approach. The study found patients who received our in-home preventative wellness assessments, compared with those who hadn't made fewer emergency department visits and spent fewer nights in hospitals across four common conditions: depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and Type 2 diabetes. They also experienced reduced wait times for follow-up primary Care. Yale Medicine\u2019s research follows another peer reviewed study published in JAMA in December, which found Medicare Advantage patients in Optum's fully accountable care model showed significantly better health outcomes, compared to people in Medicare fee for service. OptumHealth patients fared better on each of eight key metrics: including hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. We see these results as compelling validation of the value-based care approach and signal more strongly its promise and potential, as we expand these care models to many millions more patients in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to UnitedHealth Group, President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to elaborate on how we're focusing on affordability, transparency, and simplicity for the people we serve. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thanks Andrew. Making high quality care, more affordable and more accessible is what we do. So it is really great to see people getting the care they need, especially as our teams are working to build more capacity and our benefit networks and care delivery resources to accommodate consumers' evolving needs. Affordability is vital. For far too many people, cost remains the most significant barrier to high quality care. We are leaning in hard on behalf of consumers, employers, and health plans to lower out of pocket costs and drive greater affordability throughout the system. As you heard from Andrew, recently we've seen an uptick in outpatient surgeries. Finding the most appropriate site of service is crucial, because the cost of those procedures can differ dramatically depending upon where they are performed. Overall, evidence shows that comparable procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers cost about half as much as traditional settings with comparable outcomes. For consumers, that translates into many 100 of dollars in out of pocket cost savings for just a single procedure. And the patient satisfaction levels at our centers are among the highest in healthcare with NPS approaching 90. Also high on our affordability agenda is continuing to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Our customers including employers, unions, health plans and governments count on us to help them access the most effective medicines at the lowest possible cost. In fact, pharmacy benefit managers like ours are the only link in the drug supply chain whose main purpose is to improve affordability for everyone. We go further by recommending benefit designs and providing tools to help consumers navigate their options and find the best value for their prescription. A recently launched feature called Price Edge, which provides the lowest cost option for a patient's medication. Already has delivered millions of dollars in customer out of pocket savings. Especially drug cost continue to be a focus of every customer OptumRx works with. Our differentiated approach to specialty is designed to serve the unique needs of patients, payers, providers, and pharma partners and has allowed us to greatly expand our access to limited distribution drugs. We work to tailor our programs with individualized single point of contact care for rare disease and clinical excellence programs for conditions such as MS, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Clients working with OptumRx, who implement all our specialty medication management programs can save up to 20% on the specialty drug cost. Most related to specialty biosimilars are another area where we are helping drive affordability and consumer choice. Earlier this year, we began offering Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira at parity ensuring patients and their doctors have more options to choose from when deciding on a course of care. Recently OptumRx and UnitedHealthcare announced the addition of two new Humira biosimilars, Cyltezo and Hyrimoz to our standard prescription drug list also at parry. This increased competition for the innovator drug will result in double-digit savings for our customers. You might also recall that a year ago, we announced our initiative to offer lifesaving drugs at no cost to our customers. This benefit is available to everyone in UnitedHealthcare's Group fully insured commercial plans and has been adopted by more than 500 of our self-funded customers, increasing adherence, and saving people millions of dollars. Finally, another important customer innovation that is making the health system simpler is Optum Financial\u2019s integrated card, which enables seamless access to benefits, programs, and rewards for more than 13 million consumers, who have been issued the card since we broadly rolled it out at the start of the year. Adoption and satisfaction levels have been very strong, make it much simpler for seniors to navigate the system and understand their benefits and creating a more satisfying consumer experience. These and many other results are validating our strategic approach to healthcare. I know from my many meetings with customers that these affordability, transparency, and simplicity initiatives are resonating. They are a key reason for our continued growth in a highly competitive environment and for our confidence in maintaining our momentum as we look ahead. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. Adaptability and delivering greater value for the people we serve continue as foundational elements for our enterprise. These last few months are a good example, identifying evolving market trends; moving quickly to help people get the care they need; incorporating our broad and multifaceted insights into planning and importantly delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. These traits underpin our confidence not only in achieving our goals for \u201823, but also as we look toward \u201824 and beyond. Before reviewing our business results, let me elaborate on the care patterns Andrew described earlier. To illustrate in the second quarter, outpatient care activity among seniors was a few 100 basis points above our expectations. As we've highlighted, specific orthopedic and cardiac procedures had increased its far above that level of variation. And as we developed and filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage offerings, we assume that these levels of heightened care activity will persist throughout next year. Overall care activity among our Medicaid and commercial populations is consistent with our expectations. As always, we continue to intensely analyze trends that may indicate more severe disease progression, which could point to rising acuity. For example, in areas such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, we see no such evidence, while continuing to monitor closely. With that, let's turn to out second quarter results. Revenue of $92.9 billion, grew by nearly $12.6 billion or 16% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. OptumHealth revenues grew by 36% to $23.9 billion, driven by an increase in the number of patients served, a growing mix of patients with more complex needs and the expanding scope of care services we can offer. Operating margins reflect the higher care activity patterns we have discussed with seniors comprising a significant majority of value-based patients served. OptumRx revenues grew by 15%, surpassing $28 billion, driven by continued new customer wins and strong double-digit growth across our specialty, infusion, and community pharmacies. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects continued demand for our affordable solutions that give customers choice and simplify the pharmacy experience, such as biosimilar access and digital pharmacy tools. Part way into the \u201824 selling season, this momentum continues with strong client additions. OptumInsight revenues grew 42% to nearly $4.7 billion. The revenue backlog reached over $31 billion, an increase of $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. The integration and investment activities discussed on previous calls have gone well and are setting the stage for the next phase of growth for OptumInsight. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our commercial business added nearly 500,000 people in the first-half and continues its growth with the \u201824 selling season indications tracking favorably. Within our public sector programs, we continue to expect growth of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members this year. And our Medicaid performance remains strong, as we continue to support states as they initiate redeterminations. Comprehensive outreach efforts to help individuals retain coverage are underway though it is still early as most states began this work only recently. Our capital capacities are strong. Adjusted cash flows from operations were at $10.4 billion or nearly 2 times net income in the second quarter and $15.6 billion or nearly 1.4 times net income in the first-half. In the first six 6 months of this year, we returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and in June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 14%. As Andrew mentioned, based upon our growth outlook and the trends discussed, today we were able to strengthen and narrow our full-year \u201823 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.70 to $25 per share. Within this, we expect a relatively balanced pacing in the second-half. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: John, thank you. Overall, for UnitedHealth Group, looking to the second-half of the year and into 2024 and beyond. We're confident that we're capturing the current landscape in our planning decisions, which in turn gives us confidence in our ability to sustain the growth momentum shown in our first-half and continue to demonstrate the adaptability, performance, and mission-driven purpose of this enterprise, especially in evolving environments. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.\nOperator: The floor is now opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe I appreciate the comments about what you're seeing in the care demand. Maybe on the OptumHealth side, if you guys, obviously top line continues to be very strong there. There's a little bit of margin degradation from first quarter to second quarter? How much of that relates to what you're describing around senior utilization? I know you've got a capitated component and you've got a free for service component. But I think last quarter you also said that the growth in membership would be something that would pressure margin short-term, but obviously be a long-term positive? And then there's a lot of other things in OptumHealth. Are they helping or hurting margin? Give us a little bit of flavor for what's happening underneath the aggregate number.\nAndrew Witty: A.J., thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me start off, I'm super pleased with the performance of OptumHealth overall. And when you look at the growth of that business and particularly the expansion of the number of patients who we're now looking after in value based arrangements now about 4 million folks, but not just from UAC, but of course, from many other payors as well, really strong validation of the model that we've been building and you can continue to see us extend that. In terms of the margin compression during the Q really I'd say there are a couple of dynamics to that. One, is trend and you\u2019d very much echo in the senior trend comments you've heard us make earlier in the quarter and I think is well understood. A second element of that which specifically affects OptumHealth is the behavioral growth. And I mentioned that in my prepared comments A.J., around continued strong growth in behavioral. That certainly has played its part within Q2 for OptumHealth. And then the third area is a kind of, a good news story, but with short-term implication. So that's really the growth of the membership that's coming this year. As you know, we've grown very strongly this year, actually a little ahead of our expectations. We've also brought in a very significant number of complex patients as we invest in helping those folks manage their care better, that puts a little pressure on the margin in the short run. But that's really laying super strong foundation stones, not just 4 million as we move through the year, but into \u201824, \u201825, \u201826. So those three elements, the senior trend piece, the behavioral piece, and then the effect of the strong growth is really what explains what goes on. We're going to continue to lean into that growth very assertively. A.J, thanks so much.\nA.J. Rice: Alright.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to understand when I think about the guide to the upper end for the full-year MLR. How much of that is driven by this MA outpatient trend versus behavioral? And when I think about behavioral utilization, is that being driven by a particular population, or is it more broad-based? And, you know, how do I just think about behavioral as a percentage of your cost?\nAndrew Witty: So Lisa, thanks so very much for that. Let me ask John to just context for you a little bit the balance between the senior and behavioral. And then maybe ask Dr. Decker to just give you a little bit of commentary around the type of consultation that we're dealing with in terms of the growth.\nJohn Rex: Lisa, good morning, it's John. So in terms of your question, the majority of the guide to the upper end of the full-year is driven by what we've described in terms of the activity, the care activity we're seeing amongst the seniors in outpatient, so that's the core there. In terms of behavioral, what we've noticed in behavioral is an increase in the number of people accessing care. Andrew have this in his comments, but a very, very significant increase even just since a year ago in terms of the number of people that are looking to access care, it\u2019s a great thing, we are planning on that continuing. We don't see why that trend slows down, so we're designing our benefits for that to continue. As you recall, I know Lisa, behavioral resides within OptumHealth, and so that's a kind of an impact that we'd see in that component. And Wyatt, maybe some other commentary?\nWyatt Decker: Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Lisa. So you asked about the types of consultations and care being provided within behavioral. And we're seeing across the board increasing utilization, but what's encouraging from a public health perspective is it isn't strictly young people. It's across the board. We're seeing 30, 40, 50-year old accessing behavioral healthcare for needed care for conditions like anxiety, depression, substance use disorder. And our commitment is to make sure that they have access to that care. So as you heard from Andrew earlier, we've expanded our behavioral healthcare network and we also a couple of years ago very thoughtfully launched a behavioral care provider services and we now have ambulatory services available in 37 states, and we have self-paced modules for things like anxiety and depression and we add a therapist as appropriate. So you'll see us continuing to make sure our members have access, as well as providing innovative scalable solutions for behavioral healthcare needs across the age spectrum. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Wyatt, thank you so much. So, Lisa, I think you got it there. Overall, it\u2019s very much around the senior trend phenomena. Within OptumHealth, that the behavioral piece plays its part we see that very much as an area where we will continue to step up and make sure that we're delivering the care in the way that Wyatt just described to you. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. John, you mentioned the balance pacing of EPS in the back half of the year between 3Q and 4Q. Could you talk about your expectations for MCR, specifically between the two quarters? And how are you thinking about the trend of care activity as we head into the back half of the year given what you're seeing with respect to demand, as well as some of the supply bottlenecks that took care being delivered maybe being removed? And do those factors differ significantly between Medicare and the commercial or Medicaid lines of business? Thank you.\nJohn Rex: Nate, good morning. Thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of the balance pacing, the way I describe that is -- and MCR and how that feeds in, we'd expect the MCR to be a little bit lower in the 3Q than we saw in the 2Q, some of that seasonality, as you would fully expect. So within the contexting of balance, expect earnings to be a little bit higher marginally in 3Q than 4Q, because of that typical factor in there, and thinking of an MCR somewhere in the zone of between, kind of, what we saw in the 1Q and 2Q just by seasonality factor. Important in that is we expect the, kind of, general pacing of care activity to remain consistent. That's what we've actually been seeing here. So since we've talked about this and as we've looked at the level of care activity across the company, these elements we talked about in terms of senior outpatient care are really remaining stable at the levels we talk to. And our expectation is it continues in that level. So as you look out to the second-half of this year, our expectation, it continues at those levels that we've been seeing with the -- I mentioned a few 100 basis points above our expectations in the senior business, that continues. The only underlying factor is a little bit of seasonality that you would see occurring there.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thanks so much John and thanks Nate. Next question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. My question is on commercial trend. That you mentioned it's in line with expectations. I wanted to delve a little bit deeper. I think you might have said previously that you'd priced for commercial trend to be above normal this year, so some conservatism. So does that mean that it's running above normal, but in line with your pricing at this point? If it's above normal, can you tell us how Q2 emerged versus Q4, Q1, meaning that an uptick versus -- in 2Q versus 1Q or 4Q? And then just lastly, any insight on the commercial components, is outpatient at pressure here as well? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Justin, thanks so much for the question. I mean, so really not much to see here in all honesty, first off. Where we came into the year, we -- as you alluded to, we priced for some anticipation of unit cost inflation. We've seen some of that come through. Within that, everything is tracking very much within our expectations. So we set the year anticipating a little bit of price/cost growth, if you will. But beyond that, really nothing to note and we feel good about where we sit here. Thanks so much. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. SO good morning. Do you think any of the increased utilization you're seeing on the MA side was self-inflicted in the sense that you've really augmented benefits dramatically in the last year -- really last two years, and perhaps that's encouraged or even catalyzed, sort of, an overutilization of trends relative to historical patterns and expectations? And then how did you address the utilization trends in your benefit designs for \u201824? I know there's sensitivity about saying something on a public call, but maybe just broad changes that you'd expected?\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to give you a little bit more commentary. But I think bottom line, I don't really think the benefits are driving this. I think this is -- when you look at the concentration of what we're seeing in terms of the outpatients, the orthopedics, in particular, those sorts of areas, it looks very much more like a kind of deferment of care. Super interesting when you look at maybe what's changed a little bit within that. We've seen a shift in the fraction of people who, once they have been essentially recommended for surgery, actually go through, and complete the procedure. Arguably, what might drive that change is, one, more supply. So actually, it's more possible to go get it done; but two, maybe a little less reticent from an individual to go into a facility in a post-COVID environment versus a COVID environment. That feels like the thing that's shifted. And maybe ask Tim to just add a little bit to that as well, Tim?\nTim Noel: Yes. Thanks, Josh. Consistent with what Andrew said, when we look at potential drivers everything from acuity to benefits added to mix of membership. Everything is really tracking very normally and in line with what we would expect. So nothing to call out there, but certainly something that we look at closely and carefully each and every year, and this year being no different. With respect to your question regarding benefits, so I think one thing to keep in mind is that the more important driver to our benefit decisions this year were the changes to the risk model. Certainly, we've been talking a lot about care patterns, but that has far less of an impact on the benefits filed and is really one of many assumptions that we make inside of our bids. But we feel very confident in our ability to provide stability to the benefits that seniors value most, things like zero co-pays for primary care visits, zero co-pays for Tier 1 drugs. Keeping zero monthly planned premiums where we had them in the past and keeping level out of pocket maximums are very important things for benefits for stability. And we are able to preserve those, so we're really happy about that. So on balance, combined with the great momentum we see in our value proposition, the great partnerships we have and confidence from the broker community, we feel really good about the benefits we filed. And also, as we talked about in our opening remarks, really confident in seeing that momentum pull through into some great growth results next year.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And Josh, thanks very much for the question. Next questions?\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, a question on the commercial side of the business. Can you talk a little bit about membership and in the fee-based business being down? And also may be related to that and your outlook going forward, in Medicaid redetermination, are you seeing any trends with respect to recapture of those sorts of members? Or anything that's driving the opportunity for either growth in membership or maybe you're seeing in-account attrition due to weakness in the economy? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Lance, thanks so much for the question. Before I hand it to Dan Kueter, who looks after our E&I business, I just want to make a couple of kind of high-level comments. We're seeing overall a very strong performance from our commercial business this year and also setting up, it feels like very well for the \u201824 season. We've seen fantastic overall growth, as I mentioned, in terms of membership. And that's been led very much by a lot of the product innovation that the team have been putting together and into the marketplace. And we see that continuing pretty assertively as we roll into \u201824. Just with that kind of backdrop, maybe, Dan, if you could respond to Lance's specific questions, that would be great.\nDan Kueter: Yes, Lance, thanks for the question. Growth is on track for the full-year. And what you see in Q2 really is represented by the contraction of one large customer in our fee-based business. Your question about attrition and redeterminations, the outcome of those, which will be some puts and takes, will probably determine where within our range we will fall. But the punch line is, we're on track to hit our range for this year. Thanks for the question, Lance.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks so much, Lance, for the questions. And just to be super clear as well that client loss that Dan just referred to, we knew about that about a year ago very much within our expectations and forecast plan. It was something we were anticipating and makes no impact at all to our full-year expectation. But thanks so much for the question. And next questions, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I just want to follow-up on the OptumHealth, because the margin there was obviously pressured in the quarter. And I just want to understand how the margin normalization -- how should we think about that over the next couple of years. I mean, you can -- on the MA side, you can reprice for things. It sounds like you saw it in time for your bids and costs have come in line with the way that you price. Maybe just confirm that piece first. But then since within OptumHealth, you're also relying on other providers and how they price for 2024. How are you thinking about the market? If you're below target this year? Is this something you can get back to next year or just a multi-year thing depending on how others price? Are the leverage within your control or is this kind of a longer-term normalization? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So first off, as I mentioned earlier, the pressure is really coming from those three sources, the senior trend phenomenon that we talked a lot about, the very specific Optum piece around behavioral and then the growth in the book. And within that, very much to complex care patient, which, as I'm going to repeat again, is an extremely positive element of our growth going forward. That's going to be an extraordinarily important foundation stone for the future of the company. We're going to continue to lean into that growth, first and foremost. We do expect to see margins continue to strengthen, particularly as you roll through into \u201824. You're absolutely right. We believe we've caught this in our pricing for next year. But more importantly, the longer time we have to look after folks and wrap around care, we can deliver much better outcomes for them, as we talked about earlier and we can also make the economic proposition better. It really builds much more sustainable capability. So all of that will kick in, as well as we roll through subsequent quarters and years. This is going to be a continuing building pressure. I feel very good about that range we've laid out for OptumHealth over the next several years. And actually, I think if I had the choice on a slightly suppressed margin in Q2 or the very significant growth that we've taken in. I'll take the growth all day long. And I'll take that growth, because it's going to underpin years of growth going forward. Appreciate the question, Kevin. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I just want to talk about some of the -- or ask about some of the levers and offset, because it is a little counterintuitive to hear the commentary intra-quarter about higher MLR and then seeing your largest profit segment, OptumHealth, with lower margin. So this quarter, obviously, investment income was far stronger The Street was looking for, at least versus our model G&A, was better. But I know moving into the back half, I think you believe there's more time potentially to pull some of those G&A levers. So could you just talk about investment income, G&A or what other offsets there might be in the back half? And how much of that is carrying forward into your \u201824 thinking at this point?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Very much appreciate the question. Let me ask John to make some comments to that. John?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Gary, it's John. So yes, you're right. Those investment income has frankly, been growing strongly over the past number of quarters and continues to grow. Some of that is the backdrop of the rising interest rate environment, as you know, very well. Some of that is also a result of very active management by our treasury teams in terms of deploying more and more cash balances into interest-bearing accounts and such as they've been working hard at that over the past few quarters and advancing the productivity of that cash. That's after coming off of a period of many years of a zero interest rate environment. So a lot of elements in that. In any given quarter, we can experience some gains from our -- in our investment portfolio. So that can be gained from -- anything from our regular fixed income investments to anything from our diverse venture holdings. And so those come in -- they come in at different points in time. And perhaps sometimes they're a little bit less predictable, but kind of are typically in a similar zone frankly, not outside. I don't expect those, kind of, things, I don't count on those kind of things, frankly, every quarter. That's not the thing we look at. But there are elements that we've seen over time in kind of the zones that we're experiencing even now, too. So, yes, thanks, Gary.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. And maybe I'll ask Dirk to also comment a little bit. As you think about the G&A side of the equation going forward. Dirk maybe reflect a little bit on the work you're leading around technology and other interventions as we look to drive down our overall costs.\nDirk McMahon: Yes. Gary, what I would say is much of the focus -- we've really been applying a lot of artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. Long-term, we think there's great hope for those. And some of the short-term things that we're working on in those areas, like using generative AI to help more efficiently write medical appeal letters, things like optimizing our provider search and all of our digital properties with natural language processing and AI, doing a lot of work, improving our payment integrity models, using AI to detect waste, fraud, and abuse. And then a lot in the G&A world to answer basic questions in our call centers, like leveraging our benefit bots to reduce the number of calls and the labor associated with that, for simple questions like is x, y, or z disease covered or have I met my deductible. From a long range perspective, however, I'm really optimistic about our significant data sets. Our ability to take advantage of whatever new technology comes down the pipe to improve health care, I'm really excited about it. So thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Yes, Dirk, thanks so much. And I think, Gary, overall, and I think I tried to allude at the very beginning. Obviously, when you see a movement in care activity like we saw in the quarter, it's been great to see the range of levers that we have within the organization to respond. And you've seen what we've been able to do in the very short run. And as you would expect that we have more and more of those levers as you roll through into the medium and longer-term outlooks as both John and Dirk have described both in the financial side of the company, but also critically in the core operating cost structure of the company, which we're going to continue to bear down on very, very assertively. Consequence of all of that is that even with the backdrop of some of the fluidity we've seen. We're able to continue to commit to the investment behind growth and the investment behind looking after patients, as well as we possibly can and giving people a fantastic experience, which is what we think builds super sustainable shareholder value. So that's very much the priority that we're focused on. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess, John, I want to talk a little bit more about your expectations for the senior book in \u201824. You guys kind of talked about that you expect the current elevated trend to continue and price for it when you think about the MA bids. I guess, kind of talk about like what drove, like what drives the visibility there from what you see now in ortho, like looking all the way out to \u201824. And should we think of the pricing is just kind of conservatism on UNH's part? Or like I'm kind of interested in the data that drives the visibility? Thank you\nAndrew Witty: Hey George, thanks for the question. I'm actually going to ask Tim Noel, who leads the Medicare business to respond to that, Tim?\nTim Noel: Thanks, George, for the question. So I'll start by reiterating one thing as an important point. The biggest item though shaping this year has been -- thinking was around the risk model changes. The outpatient care patterns plays a far smaller role there. But that said, having the ability to incorporate the latest data, anything we've learned recently into our Medicare Advantage bids is extremely important in each and every year especially given how we see both key revenue and medical elements firm up inside of Q2, being able to incorporate the latest thinking that we have in our bid filings is really, really important. And because of that, we've designed a bid process that is very nimble and able to accommodate late changes. This year, out of respect for a developing trend, we made the assumption that some of these early indications that we are seeing in the outpatient care patterns we have talked about would remain durable. And as we sit here today, as John has talked about, these assumptions have validated and they've also stabilized. And we feel confident that we've made the appropriate accommodations inside of our 2024 bids for all of this. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. Jenifer, we have time for one last question. So, let\u2019s take the last question. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, all. Thanks. I was hoping maybe you could drill a little bit just into the announcement of the Amedisys acquisition. And maybe in particular, just talk about, sort of, strategy for ramping up the exposure here given the tough near-term reimbursement environment for home health? And then maybe some early thoughts around some of the integrations or synergies that you could generate from integrating Amedisys in LHCG together? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for the question. Well, first of all, we're obviously very pleased to have come to an agreement on the transaction with Amedisys, so we appreciate that. But as you'd expect, it's -- we're now in the very early stages of that process. It wouldn't be appropriate to talk about anything specific in that regard. If I just take it maybe a level higher, it's no secret that we are very strong believers in the value of home health and no secret that we believe that value -- home health capabilities, when combined with other activities in terms of wrapping care around patients, is a really important element of future value-based care, particularly as you speak towards complex patients, many of whom maybe struggle to get out of the home, maybe don't have quite the same kind of relationship with the clinic as you might often expect. So we do think that the general area is an important area. As I said, as far as the specifics are concerned, I think we're now -- we'll go through our -- the regular kind of process, and we'll update you as appropriate, but probably not much more to say today. Thanks so much, Scott, for the question. And thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. We very much appreciate your time. And we hope you take away from this call our confidence in our ability to continue to perform and grow strongly, while we pursue our mission and build the foundations for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. And we are very much looking forward to sharing more on our progress with you again in October. Thanks so much for your time this morning.\nOperator: This does concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "UNH", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-04-14 13:17:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earning reports section of the company\u2019s Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and Form 8-K dated April 14, 2023, which maybe accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across Optum and UnitedHealthcare with revenue increasing 15% to $92 billion. This broad-based growth, combined with the continued focus of our colleagues on tight execution, helped us deliver first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.26, up 14% over last year. Year-to-date, UnitedHealthcare increased the number of people served in the U.S. by 1.2 million, about half of this total within our commercial offerings. At OptumHealth, we are now serving nearly 700,000 more patients under fully accountable value-based arrangements compared to just December 2022. Given the strength in these results, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the full year to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. I know one topic is front of mind for you this morning. So I will start with Medicare Advantage. With the 2024 Medicare Advantage notice in hand, we now have greater clarity for the short to mid-term evolution of this important program. Our teams are working through the implications of the changes for 2024 and we will be ready to submit bids in just a few weeks. While we remain concerned about some of the potential unintended consequences of the changes of the risk adjustment model, particularly around adequate diagnosis and support for people with diabetes, complex behavioral needs and more, we do appreciate CMS\u2019 decision to phase-in the changes. This phase-in will allow for more time to minimize impacts on beneficiaries as we lean on the multiple levers available to us, including our ability to manage costs and our relentless focus on member and patient needs. We expect the many years of work and investment our teams have put into product and value differentiation as well as quality measures such as Star scores will enable us to continue to offer leading value to Medicare beneficiaries and to grow strongly for years to come. We are committed to working with CMS as stewards of the MA program, especially with its long-stated goal of promoting value-based care, which remains the best solution to promote equitable access, better healthcare outcomes, exceptional experiences and lower cost for the system. And importantly, it best supports people who have historically been underserved and who face fragmented, less effective care under traditional fee-for-service. Seniors know that with MA versus fee-for-service, they can access a more integrated and comprehensive suite of critical health benefits, including prescription medicines, vision, dental and hearing care. They can seek care in more convenient settings. They experience better health outcomes, such as an over 40% lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations and consistently derive much greater value. In fact, the typical Medicare Advantage senior spent about $2,000 a year less out of pocket compared to seniors in traditional Medicare. And well over 90% of seniors in Medicare Advantage report they are highly satisfied with their coverage and care. That\u2019s why more than 30 million Americans, fully half of all seniors, choose Medicare Advantage today. Over the past year, we focused on improving the consumer experience across our company. This consumer orientation is foundational in support of each of our growth priorities, including our approach to value-based care. For example, this year, we expect to serve more than 4 million patients in fully accountable value-based care arrangements through Optum, about double where we were at the end of 2021. These patients will be members of UnitedHealthcare benefit plans or one of the many other plans served by Optum. Many of them are in Medicare Advantage. And increasingly, we are serving people with Medicaid or commercial benefits, an important growth focus for the coming years. We have spent well more than a decade investing in essential infrastructure and offering extensive practice transition support to enable tens of thousands of care providers to participate in this comprehensive value-based approach. By integrating traditional ambulatory care with specialty behavioral and pharmacy care across in-clinic, virtual and in-home settings, we are delivering measurably better health outcomes for patients, all while improving access and lowering costs for people and the healthcare system overall. Our focus on consumers is helping to drive growth within health benefits, including strong growth in our commercial offerings, and our early indications are for continued robust commercial growth in 2024. From our employee-centered Surest insurance offer to our innovative financial services for both members and care providers, to our improved pharmacy home delivery services and zero co-pays on life-saving drugs, through all of these initiatives and more, we are firmly on track to put the member, patient and consumer at the very heart of what we do. One last note on UnitedHealthcare benefits and the resumption of Medicaid redeterminations, now that the process has started, we are working with our state partners and others to provide as much information and support as possible so people can understand and access their best coverage options. And we expect to be serving more people in our benefit programs when this process is completed. And now I will turn it over to UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Dirk?\nDirk McMahon: Thanks, Andrew. Picking up on redeterminations, for many months, we have been preparing to help people when this activity resumes as it now has in over 20 states. We are working closely with Medicaid members to navigate eligibility guidelines and help find alternative coverage options if they are no longer Medicaid-eligible. This effort includes live outreach calls to educate and assist members with renewal process to ensure they retain their existing coverage or can transition to other plans. We are also engaged with employers to extend annual enrollment periods and drive awareness for employees who are eligible for coverage. With extended eligibility and increased subsidies, many people will qualify for other plans, some with no monthly premium. UnitedHealthcare is executing our detailed plans to ensure as many people as possible have uninterrupted access to coverage and care if they are no longer eligible for Medicaid. Let me now turn to the opportunity we have to more deeply and effectively serve people in their homes. Nearly all of the patients we will add this year in fully accountable value-based relationships will have access to support through our home-based platform. Consumers value and benefit from services delivered in the home and we have expanded our capabilities to serve that need. I will highlight four of our key capabilities in this important area. First, patient assessments, in-home clinical visits designed to identify care needs and help patients with other physical and social needs. This year, we expect to make more than 2.5 million visits to patients\u2019 homes and we continue to expand the scope of the clinical services offered in that setting. Next, care transitions. This entails supporting patients into and through post-acute settings, helping people to avoid hospital readmissions after an inpatient stay. This year, we will manage nearly 12 million care transitions, about twice as many as just 3 years ago. This plays an important role in helping people return safely home and in connecting patients with additional in-home support. Third area, senior community care. This is clinical care for seniors who live in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities and dedicated senior housing. Our clinical teams provide additional layers of care and on-call resources, and they coordinate among patients in their primary care provider, facility staff and caregivers, all contributing to strong quality of care and outcomes. And the fourth area of clinical capability is individual care and coordination for Medicare dual and chronic special needs patients. These patients frequently require a more individualized approach to care. On average, these patients are managing nine different chronic conditions and taking multiple medications. Our high-touch approach leads to better outcomes, including an over 15% reduction in hospitalizations, high patient satisfaction with an NPS of nearly 80 with 99% of our patients in a four-star or higher plan. Our recent combination with LHC Group expands in-home capabilities. LHC provides high-quality, compassionate home health, hospice and post-acute care services with over 12 million patient encounters each year. We will learn from and build upon LHC\u2019s capabilities, expanding the scope and acuity of the care we can provide in a patient\u2019s health. And finally, shifting to pharmacy care services. OptumRx just completed another strong growth season. We are winning new relationships by offering the lowest cost and strong service across a wide variety of customers from health plans to labor and governments and to commercial employers. We help customers obtain the best net cost, and we use our clinical expertise to help treat conditions that call for specialty medications. In addition, consumers are benefiting from efforts such as Price Edge, which gives them the best-price option whether on or off benefit; UnitedHealthcare\u2019s introduction last year of zero-cost life-saving drugs; and our ability to manage the introduction of biosimilars on equal footing with the existing branded product. In short, we have consumers\u2019 backs. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Dirk. Fundamental execution has long been an essential aspect of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s ability to deliver for all those we serve. We know that if we meet or exceed our commitments and strive to live up to our potential, we will continue to generate high-quality durable growth. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by the strong and accelerating growth achieved across the businesses of UHC and Optum. We accomplished this while continuing to expand upon the foundations, which will drive the future growth you have come to expect from us. Revenue in the first quarter of $92 billion grew by nearly $12 billion or 15% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. This growth was achieved by serving more people across all our businesses, and importantly, by serving them more comprehensively. UnitedHealth Group served \u2013 UnitedHealthcare served about 1.2 million more people in the first 3 months of the year with strong growth across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Optum revenues grew 25% to $54 billion. Care patterns remain largely consistent with recent trends. For example, inpatient trends continue to reflect the growing long-term movement towards ambulatory sites of care. Today, nearly two-thirds of orthopedic procedures are performed in outpatient and other ambulatory settings compared to under one quarter just 5 years ago. Physician office activity continues to trend toward historic levels, while a few categories such as pediatrics remain lower. Emergency room visits remain modestly lower than historical levels with consumers seemingly more comfortable with virtual and walk-in care. Cancer and cardiac screenings are occurring at roughly pre-pandemic levels helped in part by focused efforts to ensure people are obtaining appropriate preventive care. As always, we continue to closely analyze data for indications which could signal increasing acuity, but have yet to see those emerge. Looking now at the performance of the individual businesses in the first quarter. OptumHealth revenues grew by 38% to $23 billion as we expanded a number of patients served under value-based care arrangements. Revenue per consumer served grew by 34% driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we can offer. OptumInsight revenues grew 40% to $4.5 billion. The revenue backlog reached $30.7 billion, an increase of nearly $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. As we have discussed before, in the first half, we expect to continue to increase our integration and investment activities, which were a component in the first quarter results, and we expect they will accelerate into the second quarter. OptumRx revenues grew 15%, surpassing $27 billion, driven by strong double-digit growth across the businesses, including in our community and home delivery pharmacies. Script growth of $26 million over last year was driven by exceptional customer retention as well as new customer adds. We continue to see strong growth in NPS for our specialty businesses, up nearly 10 points since last year. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of over $70 billion grew 13% with growth in the number of people served across all of our major benefit categories. For example, in commercial, we set out to serve up to 1 million more people this year and are pacing well to that objective given our first quarter performance. Offerings for large employers led the gains as did our newer and more affordable offerings serving both employers and individuals. Within Medicare Advantage, we shared with you in November our intention to add 800,000 to 900,000 new members in this year, and we now expect to exceed the upper end of that rate. The consistent consumer receptivity to our offerings underscores the product stability and value we provide for seniors. Medicaid membership grew 570,000 over the year ago quarter. We continue to have momentum in Medicaid with recent wins in Indiana and Texas, and we are honored to advance our existing service to the people of North Carolina as the state moves towards expanding managed Medicaid offerings. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flows from operations in the quarter at $16.3 billion reflected an additional CMS payment. Adjusting for this effect, first quarter cash flows from operations were consistent with our outlook, and we continue to track well with our full year view to approach $28 billion, about 1.2x net income. In the quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and deployed about $8 billion of growth capital to expand our capabilities to serve more people and grow far into the future. As Andrew mentioned, based upon this growth outlook, today, we increased our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.50 to $25 per share. We expect the first half, second half earnings progression to be broadly consistent with our longer-term historical patterns with the second half comprising just slightly more than half of the full year. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Our comments on this call gives us a flavor of why we\u2019re confident in our outlook for the year and our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth target. Our growth is broad-based and it\u2019s driven within and increasingly across our businesses bolstered, as always, by an enterprise focus on execution on behalf of those we serve. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions. One per caller please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead and take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks so much. And thanks for all the comments. Maybe just because it\u2019s been in the news as well the whole review of PBMs and some of the approaches the industry has had historically, maybe I\u2019ll just ask you guys to remind us what your approach is relative to rebates, spread pricing and so forth. And then I know OptumRx does a lot more than a traditional PBM. Maybe give people some perspective on the breadth of OptumRx relative to some of the things that are specifically being discussed in Washington today, if possible.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. A.J., thanks so much for the question. Let me make a couple of comments, and then I\u2019m going to hand to Heather Cianfrocco, who looks after our OptumRx business. So first off, I mean, I think the entire space of pharmacy is a critical one within healthcare. It\u2019s the most common touch point for the health system. It\u2019s also an incredibly significant part of the system in terms of where innovation comes into the marketplace. So we\u2019re in important set of activities which need to be delivered effectively on behalf of patients, members, consumers. Having said that, of course, it\u2019s all about affordability and value for money. And there is a real risk, if you see situations where you have essentially monopoly holders, so let\u2019s say, drug companies that have a monopoly over a particular product, there needs to be a counterbalance in terms of the price negotiation to make sure that those prices are effectively procured on behalf of members who otherwise would just not have that kind of ability to negotiate. That\u2019s really the central role that the PBMs play here. There are various mechanisms in which the PBM operates. The rebate mechanism is one that historically has been used in this way. As you well know, A.J., Optum, OptumRx in particular, has led the way in terms of transparency and making sure that, for example, the overwhelming majority of rebates are passed back to the payers of those drugs, typically the plans or the employers who commission us to procure on their behalf. As we look more broadly across the whole landscape of the pharmacy marketplace, there are a few things that I think we strongly believe in and we continue to advocate for very significantly. Number one, there needs to be a counterbalance to the drug company pricing, and the only players in the market right now who are really advocating hard for reducing cost is the PBM. Number two, at Optum, we are committed to lowest net cost. And whether we get there through rebate or we get there through lower list prices, we don\u2019t mind. We\u2019re very happy when people cut list prices because that cuts cost. We\u2019re very happy when we secure increased rebates because that cuts costs. So we continue to focus on that lowest net cost, and we\u2019re super committed to transparency. We\u2019re also committed to finding ways in which we can bring benefits directly to patients, which is why we led last year with zero cost pay for the UnitedHealthcare books of business initially for life-saving drugs. So that\u2019s kind of the big landscape. Now there\u2019s more detail in areas that maybe Heather could take you into, and I\u2019ll pass to her now to give you a little bit more. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. Thank you. And maybe I would just supplement and just say, A.J., thank you. We are \u2013 certainly, it is in the news. We\u2019re mindful of the interest in this essential service. But I guess I\u2019d also point you to the client need for these essential services. Our PBM services not just negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to drive that lowest net cost for drugs available, as Andrew mentioned, but the clinical supports and services through the pharmacy and therapeutics committees and pipeline reviews, that network administration and all of the benefit administration and consultation that we provide to clients of all sizes and types from government to employer to large sophisticated health plans. And I take validation in the fact that, that business model is needed by our clients, and it\u2019s appreciated. The transparent business model of OptumRx, together with the innovative capabilities, some of our differentiated strategies like the biosimilar strategy that Andrew mentioned that not just brought competition into the market by bringing up to three biosimilars at parity with the originator on the formulary, accepting the high list price and the list price and putting those together and offering them to the clients from our consumer tools like our latest Price Edge that does scan across the market and compares the cash pricing with the members\u2019 real-time out-of-pocket cost to make sure they get the best price. Those are innovative offerings that I\u2019m really proud that our clients find valuable. And we evolve with those needs. So I think I\u2019d point us to the fact that we had a very strong selling season, one of the highest over the last years, in terms of retention and new client shows that the services are needed. We will continue to evolve our business models to our clients\u2019 needs while we continue to engage policymakers and others to make sure that everybody understands the essential value of that PBM service, the distinctive capabilities and transparent business model of OptumRx and in addition, make sure that we ensure client choice and we preserve that function. But I guess that also \u2013 just take the opportunity to say you\u2019re right. OptumRx is so much more than just our PBM, which is incredibly important to our clients. We are so proud of them and I\u2019m so proud of the team. You saw the growth in our pharmacies. But from our community pharmacies that it just celebrated a 700th opening of our behavioral health pharmacy, a very distinctive offering in the market to our specialty with not just high NPS but a 24/7 clinical model and distinctive capabilities for those members that really benefit from specialty drugs but in oftentimes, need our patient support and assistance, including financial. And then, of course, our infusion business, which is very intimate in providing services in the home, and we rely on over 1,100 nurses to do that every day. So incredibly proud of the breadth of service across OptumRx but very mindful that our job in the PBM is to serve our clients and preserve their choice.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Heather. And all of that said, I think what is also really validating here, A.J., just look at the growth rate in the first quarter, 15% growth. It really reflects the competitiveness of the portfolio we have. And as I talk to our clients, what they really appreciate is the degree to which we\u2019re innovating the pharmacy model, more and more transparency, more and more pressure on bringing down those costs. That\u2019s why people are moving to us, and it\u2019s why they\u2019re not leaving us, record levels of retention within this portfolio. And just as a marker, about half of our revenues in the OptumRx portfolio come from non-PBM activities. That\u2019s all the stuff that Heather just referred to at the second part. She runs a super nicely balanced business, great growth profile because we\u2019re delivering for clients and for their members and employees. So A.J., thanks for raising that question. It\u2019s an important topic, and we appreciate having the chance to share it. Next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. I\u2019m going to stick to the PBM side for a minute and just really want to hear your comments around GLP-1 drugs. One, how do we think about the cost trend as you think about it from the managed care side of your business? And then secondly, how do we think about really truly managing this new cost of drug that\u2019s coming from a pharmacy perspective?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Lisa, it\u2019s a great question. I think, actually, it would be super interesting to hear from the UnitedHealthcare perspective on that. So I may just ask Brian Thompson, the CEO of UHC, to comment there, please.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, Andrew. Hey, Lisa, good morning. Let me start with the trends that we\u2019re seeing here in 2023 are as planned, overall medical and pharmacy. It\u2019s really a good start to the year with our assumptions being validated as we kick off 2023. With respect to GLP, obviously, a lot of discussion. I would say no real change to either our insights or our position. We have seen an increase in trend in GLP-1s. The overwhelming majority of that is in diabetic care, and it is as we had expected, low single digits in terms of weight loss use. I would say that our on-label usage has been well managed with our authorization requirements. And I think it\u2019s important to put it in the context of our overall medical. Keep in mind, pharmacy is about 20% of our overall spend in any one therapeutic class. This one certainly included less than 1%. So increased year-over-year, overwhelming majority in diabetic care, well managed in terms of off-label use and consistent with what we had planned for.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. No, listen, Brian puts it super well, Lisa. I think I think from where we sit, as we roll forward \u2013 listen, first of all, it\u2019s good news that we\u2019re seeing innovation in areas like weight management. That obviously is going to be an important aspect of consideration for people, particularly with comorbidities. Diabetes is an obvious example of that, number one. Number two, I think as time plays out, what\u2019s going to be super critical here is some of the \u2013 we need to get focused on the facts and reality of this marketplace. We need to really be clear about which patients really do benefit from these medicines and make sure we properly understand how they\u2019re going to use those medicines. So there\u2019s a lot still to learn, I think, as these things progress through their final phases. And then finally, of course, we got to see the prices be affordable, and that\u2019s going to be a key element of how this evolves. And obviously, we keep a close eye on the prices we see in Europe. And just as \u2013 you heard a little bit our focus on the pharmacy side of the business, of course, encouraged by our insurance side of the business. We\u2019re going to be looking for the very best pricing on these medicines, and we\u2019re going to advocate on behalf of members and consumers to get that. So still plenty to come here. I think early days, nothing particularly out of expectations, still very much in the range that Brian just described. Lisa, thanks for the question. Lisa, thanks for the question. Next question?\nOperator: We will take our next question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the changes the company is making to prior authorization later this year. It would be great to get some background on why you felt like these changes were necessary and how you\u2019re going to work to manage the cost implications of the changes once they\u2019re made. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Stephen, thanks so much for the question. I\u2019ll ask Brian to address that.\nBrian Thompson: Hey, Steven, thanks for the question. Yes, beginning in the third quarter of this year, we will be eliminating about 20% of our authorization volumes overall. We\u2019re also going to be eliminating most medical authorizations altogether for provider groups and systems that have demonstrated a high-quality care and adherence to the requirements over time. I\u2019d say that might be another 10% of our volumes overall. We will continue to evaluate with some new analytics that we have in partnership with OptumInsight and surveillance capabilities to see if there\u2019s some additional opportunities over time. Really, though, this is a culmination of a lot of things. And first and foremost, I would say it\u2019s our intensifying focus on the consumer experience, really a desire for us to streamline processes, get the latency out of the process and like I said, leverage new technologies to really get to speed of decisioning and really get to point of care. I will say, we are constantly reviewing our prior authorizations, but we need to balance, obviously, what we reduce with that need to guard against clinical quality and patient safety. And I would say in this really robust process that we\u2019ve started here over the last several months that it\u2019s really demonstrated the importance of the authorizations that we do have in place, so really encouraged by our surveillance capabilities. Don\u2019t anticipate any pressure on trend because of it and really see this as a win and satisfier for both our customers and our provider groups alike.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Brian, thanks so much. I might just add, I think as we play out over the next year or 2, this is also an exciting area where UHC and OptumInsight can collaborate. A lot of technology opportunity to be leveraged here, Stephen. And also as you think about the integration of the Change organization into OptumInsight, that gives us a new perspective in terms of how we can create network connectivity to take friction out as well. So how do we \u2013 what you just had a little bit there from Brian is how we kind of streamline this space. It\u2019s still got an important role at its core. Then there\u2019s a ton of opportunity we can bring to really take out a lot of that friction by leveraging technology and the capabilities that we\u2019re building up within the new OptumInsight, so really an interesting space across the whole organization. Thanks so much, Stephen and Brian. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to sneak in a couple of quick numbers questions. First, on EPS seasonality, it looks like second quarter \u2013 it sounds like you might be looking at closer to kind of flattish EPS year-over-year. Wondering if you can kind of walk through the moving parts there. I know you talked about spending more money on change, for instance. And then just anything on DCP, what range should we be thinking about there in terms of going forward? Is this a kind of \u2013 it went down in the quarter. Is this a more normal range? Kind of where do you see that kind of settling out for the year? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Justin, thanks so much. I\u2019ll ask John Rex to comment there, please.\nJohn Rex: Hi, good morning, Justin, so a few thoughts here in terms of seasonality comments. So yes, this quarter reflected some impacts actually from Change also, so I wouldn\u2019t call that seasonality. But these are investments we\u2019re making as we integrate and we build OptumInsight for the future. And I put that in the zone of $100 million or so of impact in the quarter and expect that to be a little bit higher actually in the second quarter also. In terms of full year seasonality, also, I just want to give a little commentary on that. I expect that to be kind of in the zone of what we have historically done, where you see just a little bit more than half of the earnings generated in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So more similar to if you look to kind of pre-2019 and back, those kind of patterns, that we would typically show. On your commentary \u2013 on your question on DCPs and expectations there, at this level, I would tell you, is probably more in the level that we typically would have run also pre-pandemic in terms of the levels of date clients payable that we would typically run, a few things just in terms of commentary and just seeing some of the impacts just to get really close on it. So, in addition to being at what we would consider to be kind of normalized levels here, some business mix impacts. Some of the areas we are growing in and growing rapidly in have somewhat faster payment cycles. In the first quarter, there is usually a little impact also from Part D seasonality. And kind of on the sequential move there, I would say a little \u2013 just a little bit of day count impact also in terms of \u2013 that was affecting those. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, John. Thanks Justin. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on Medicare Advantage and the phase-in of the risk model changes by CMS. I guess how might the prospects for lower rate growth over the next few years impact relative attractiveness of Medicare Advantage for seniors and the growth of that market? And do you think the risk model changes have any impact on how providers are viewing the attractiveness of full-risk arrangements? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Nathan, thanks so much for the question. So listen, I think as you sort of step back here, a couple of things I would probably just want to make super clear. First off, we really appreciate CMS\u2019 decision to phase-in these changes. That was important and we are very glad to see that. It really allows for the transition to be managed effectively, really we think and a bit \u2013 certainly, our goal is to have a transition here, which really protects the beneficiaries, make sure that it doesn\u2019t in any way kind of damage the program. Of course, it requires us to do things a little differently in some areas. But fundamentally, we think that was really important and we very, very much appreciate that. As we kind of look out to 2024, we are going to be guided by two really important principles here, Nathan. Number one, we are going to be doing what\u2019s absolutely right for the beneficiaries as we always do, so that\u2019s going to guide us in terms of how we are active. And number two, we are going to be driving to sustain our robust membership growth in this space. We believe this is an incredibly important program for seniors. We think value-based care as a piece of this program is a crucial and best way of managing members to give them the best quality outcome, best experience and best cost outcome. Given our established capabilities and our ability to focus on cost management as well as the broad portfolio of value-based services, clinics, in-house activities provided by Optum, we feel super confident in our ability to manage the evolving funding landscape. So, overall yes, it\u2019s changed, but kind of this change every year, this is a little different change to the changes we have had in other years, but it\u2019s all \u2013 these programs are always evolving. We feel, given the portfolio of capabilities we have, super well equipped to be able to pull different levers to be responsive to this to make sure that we can look after beneficiaries. I would also say that the experience we have seen in Optum, the popularity of value-based care for physicians, the way in which they like to be able to concentrate and focus on patients longitudinally, so really think about how to understand, diagnose, prevent, treat, manage that patient through the whole cycle rather than just sporadically through a fee-for-service intervention, that\u2019s a sustaining popular thing. We brought in about 10,000 or more new clinicians last year between physicians and advanced practice clinicians. I think we are going to do about the same this year. Honestly, we are seeing significant numbers of people coming in. And we would continue to expect to see value-based care continue to be a very important part of the future growth of the marketplace and of course, for us. So, as we sit today, of course we have to do things to respond to the changing environment. We feel good about our ability to do it. And I appreciate the question, Nathan. Next question.\nOperator: And we will move on to our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. I want to stay on MA and maybe more specifically, if you could speak to the impact to both, I guess UnitedHealthcare and OptumCare and more specifically, how you plan to balance the need to maintain attractive benefits to grow that membership against your ability to achieve target margins. And maybe do you think the industry will grow at similar rates? It sounds like you don\u2019t see a material impact long-term, but I am just curious if you think 2024 as an industry growth rate looks similar to what we have seen in recent years and maybe within that, how you expect UHC to fare?\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Josh, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Brian to give you a few thoughts. Brian?\nBrian Thompson: Hey Josh. Thanks for the question. I will just reiterate, I think what Andrew said. Certainly, this 3-year phase-in gives us an opportunity to minimize this impact on beneficiaries. And I will just reiterate the optimism that Andrew shared. Because of that, that gives us time to really evaluate our cost structure. First and foremost, I think that\u2019s the consideration that we are deeply focused on to make sure that we manage this impact. Look, it\u2019s not the first time that we have had to navigate a rate environment like this. So, I will just say we remain optimistic about MA and the value prop that it has broadly. We certainly feel very good about our market position in it. We intend to grow again in 2024, as Andrew had said. We expect the marketplace to continue to grow in 2024. And we continue to lead with the strong momentum that we have demonstrated for many years now. So, we are obviously in the middle of our benefit planning, but I can just share with you that we are encouraged and optimistic.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Brian. I appreciate it. Thanks Josh. Next question.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about OptumCare and the full-risk patients you have got, specifically the non-UnitedHealthcare patients? And how is the progress going as far as growing that? And how do you see this MA rate environment and high premium environment in commercial employer impacting and potentially accelerating your ability to add non-UHC risk patients?\nAndrew Witty: So, Lance, thanks so much for the question. Let me just make a couple of upfront comments, and then I will ask Dr. Wyatt Decker, who looks after Optum Health, to give you a little more detail. So first off, you are seeing now as we head towards the full year here, 4 million or so fully capitated lives within Optum Health, so under full delegation. That\u2019s an incredible progression over the last 2 years or 3 years. It\u2019s what\u2019s really \u2013 you can see a real differentiation. Super important to remember that, that is being supported not just by clinics, oftentimes people think about just clinics. Within Optum Health, this is really broadly integrated support service. So, this could be Optum at Home. This is in the clinic, it\u2019s behavioral, it\u2019s virtual. It\u2019s a really comprehensive set of capabilities that underpin that and we believe provides fantastic service for the members who are delegated. You see that growth rate continuing to be super strong, 700,000 already transferred this year. It\u2019s extraordinary first quarter for Optum Health. As you step back and look underneath the hood of all of that, of course, UHC is a big piece of it. But there is a very substantial non-UHC delegation quantum in there, which continues to grow well. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, an increase in diversification of that value base as a treatment strategy as it moves into commercial risk and also Medicaid. So, really important diversification. Maybe just talk a little bit why, give a little more detail in terms of how you are thinking about the next year or so.\nWyatt Decker: Yes. Well, thank you, Lance, and thank you, Andrew. I would underscore some of Andrew\u2019s comments. But most particularly, we have developed a comprehensive and differentiated clinical model of care for value-based care. And that is appealing to all of the large national payers who we work with closely, Lance. And so you will see us continuing to grow our book of value-based care lives with all national payers and regional payers who see the value that we are able to provide both to them and to the members and hence, patients that we serve. And you heard a little bit earlier today from Dirk McMahon on our comprehensive home and community offerings, and that\u2019s just one of our many platforms. And we weave these together in a comprehensive fashion, and we think about not just the member, but the person or patient at the other side of this who is on a journey of healthcare. And some have multiple chronic diseases. Some want to focus on staying healthy and well, and some have catastrophic issues that we have to help them navigate effectively. And our ability to do that is unique and differentiated in the healthcare industry. So, I think you will see continued growth with multiple payers. We have enjoyed that this year and will continue to do so as the year progresses. And as Andrew touched on, we really view ourselves not as solely a senior healthcare provider, but as a provider for all walks and ages of lives and particularly commercial. So, we have commercial offerings in Texas, in California and Massachusetts today, and they are a meaningful part of our 4 million fully capitated lives already today. And you will see us continuing to grow in those established markets with commercial and multiple payers as well as going into new markets. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Wyatt. Lance, thanks so much for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I just want to go back to MA for a minute. You guys \u2013 it sounds like you are saying the MA changes that are happening are not significant enough to \u2013 in isolation I think as an individual component to take you off your 13% to 16% EPS growth targets over the next few years. I just want to clarify that. But then I understand that the 3-year phase-in is important to allow you to adjust to it, but at the same time, trying to understand if there is a way to think about this. Are you thinking about the impact as being ratable, or is it a scenario where it\u2019s easier to offset in the beginning, because there is always low-hanging fruit and it\u2019s harder to offset the impact in year three, or is it the opposite, where it\u2019s harder to offset the impact in year one, because you don\u2019t have much time to adjust and it\u2019s easier to impact in year three as you have more and more time to adjust? Just trying to figure out if there is a difference in how this will play out over the next 3 years and how we should think about your growth.\nAndrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So, to your first point, no, you are absolutely right. We remain firmly of the view that the 13% to 16% long-term growth rate of adjusted earnings per share is very much the zone we are in. We \u2013 you see that again in this quarter. We continue to believe that is very much in our horizon as we go forward. Obviously, any given quarter might vary around that, but that very much is the zone we expect and I made that comment a little bit earlier, so for sure on that. Listen, as far as this \u2013 the phase-in come, this will all depend \u2013 different companies will behave differently, I suspect, through all of this. And we see, of course the change here, we will be making changes to some things in our costs and other areas, as Brian talked about earlier on. Other providers may choose to do things differently. How it plays out, I think is actually going to be a little bit of a competitive environment, actually. And I think not something we probably want to get too much into in terms of predicting or sharing exactly how we are going to respond to this. We are getting close to a bid cycle. It\u2019s a super important time. We are deeply fixated on making sure that we continue to grow. To do that, we need to make sure that our bids are super competitive. And we are working on that, and we will work our way through it. And as I said earlier, the phase-in gives us confidence that we can align with where CMS wants to end up in a way which gives the best chance of beneficiaries being looked after appropriately, and that\u2019s what we want to try and do. Thanks so much for the question. Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks for taking my question. On your commercial risk membership, can you speak to what you are seeing there? And is there anything to glean in terms of how Surest is tracking relative to your expectations? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Erin, thanks so much for the question. I am going to ask Dan Kueter who runs our E&I business to respond. Dan?\nDan Kueter: Yes. Thanks Andrew. Thanks Erin for the question. And yes, our momentum in the first quarter clearly continued the momentum we had in the back half of last year and puts us well on track, as John said in his prepared remarks, to meet our investor conference goal \u2013 investor conference targets rather, of $850 million to $1.5 billion [ph] growth. Surest was a component of that. Surest was the component, about \u2013 accounting for about 25% of our growth in the quarter as that product continues to be adopted. We have shared before that one in nine of our national accounts actually have that product today. We are continuing to see that expand down into the middle market currently as the growth of that product continues. And we also are beginning to experience take-up now on a fully insured basis for that product on a risk basis. We shared at the investor conference that Surest was available in 12 states on an insured basis with a year-end target for this year of upwards of 35 states. We currently offer that product in 25 states. So, it is a meaningful contributor to our growth, and we expect it to be so for the remainder of the year and into the future. Thanks for the question, Erin.\nAndrew Witty: Dan, thank you so much. And I just might add something here, Erin, as well. I mean I think you can see in this Q, you saw it as we rolled into the second half of last year, we are optimistic for the rest of this year. I said earlier that we are expecting continued robust growth on commercial insurance into \u201824. We really feel like this engine has let up again and it\u2019s super important for the organization. Alongside the fantastic growth you are seeing in the government books of business in Medicaid and Medicare. We are now seeing the commercial business really come to the fore again, which is a fantastic thing to see within the company. What you have also just heard a little bit is the way in which Optum is developing its capabilities to be ready to add even more value to the commercial. So, just as that Optum business has built up strength to complement UHC\u2019s leadership in Medicare, for example, you just heard Dr. Decker talking about doing the same thing in commercial. As that growth comes in from Dan\u2019s organization, you can see how that could play out. It\u2019s a super important shift and having all those engines fire in simultaneously is really good for us, and it\u2019s what\u2019s driving this growth we are seeing in Q1. So, thanks for the question, Erin. Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Hi. Thank you very much. We have received a number of questions on the EMIS acquisition in the UK, especially now with the CMA\u2019s Phase 2 investigation. And I know you can\u2019t comment on that specifically. But I was wondering if you could recap the key strategic priorities with this acquisition and discuss the specific capabilities within the platform that Optum Insight or other businesses can leverage. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Ben, thanks so much for the question. Yes, obviously, I can\u2019t get into the detail of the regulatory review. But a couple of things to say. So, for a long time, many years, Optum has had a business in the UK. Obviously, the UK is a very different type of marketplace to the U.S., but it has a couple of interesting \u2013 very interesting components. One is you have got very much a primary care-dominated environment, which is obviously very akin to big pieces of Optum Health. And it\u2019s also a marketplace which has looked to develop its abilities around data and connectivity. EMIS, which is the company we are very keen to partner with, we think could be a very important complement to Optum capabilities, particularly as it speaks to helping us connect some of our software capabilities, data analytic capabilities to primary care providers. About 40% of British primary care providers are connected into the EMIS networks. We think that gives a great opportunity to bring fantastic value to the physician practices and then ultimately to the National Health Service. And what we would like to believe if we are able to go through that transaction is that, it can really allow us to start to create another node of innovation alongside all of our other technology platforms to start to develop technology software platforms and the like, which not only could be used in a market like the UK, but in other economies around the world which perhaps have slightly different shaped healthcare systems to the U.S. healthcare system. So, we see this as good for the UK. We think it\u2019s potentially an interesting opportunity to further enhance our investments and progress in technology and software development. And it\u2019s why we are keen to continue the process to get the transaction done. And obviously, we will be working diligently on that. Thanks so much for the question, Ben. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Was actually open just to revisit the full year revenue guidance, just given the first quarter, clearly, you were pacing better than The Street, and you have since closed LHCG. And you are now looking to eclipse the high end of your MA target for the year. So clearly, it seems like there is a lot of upside momentum relative to the initial guidance you gave at Investor Day. I know you don\u2019t typically update the revenue guidance intra-quarter or during the quarters, but certainly interested if maybe you can give us some refined thinking around that. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Yes. Thanks so much. Let me ask John to comment.\nJohn Rex: Hey Scott. Good morning. Yes, good strength and growth really across the businesses in the quarter. And we are through some of those areas really across both UHC and Optum in terms of the strength we are seeing in terms of membership growth, in terms of the performance of the other businesses, Optum Rx, a call-out here in terms of the strength they have seen in terms of their new customer wins and retention and Optum Health in its growth in value-based live. So, all strong contributors to that. And yes, we are a little ahead of kind of where the view was in terms of the external view on revenue guidance. So, certainly we are positively biased in terms of the type of growth that we are seeing across the enterprise. Happy to see that. You are also right, probably not doing any updates here in the first quarter in terms of that full year view at this distance, but really strong place to start the year. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks John. And time for one last question please operator.\nOperator: Our last question will come from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Thank you very much for getting me in. I wanted to ask another question on MA and value-based care. I am wondering if the risk model, Andrew, changes your views about the target member in MA that is, say, most attractive to target between individual MA versus duals. And in value-based care, seeing nice growth, particularly interesting to us that the eliminations grew a lot, which I am inferring is inter-company between Optum Health and UHC. And I am wondering if that is a signal that duals were a big part of the value-based care add in the first quarter. So, kind of a weeds question, but strategically, basically interested to know if duals are still a very important target for MA.\nAndrew Witty: So, David, thanks so much for the question. So, you are quite right, the eliminations are a big piece of that is the Optum Health-UHC dynamic and not surprising because you see such a high risk transfer in Q1. A large fraction of that 700,000 is UHC, not obviously, others as well, but a large fraction. And of course, within that, as we have guided last year, significant proportion of dual special need patients who \u2013 most complex patients, really, I think particularly appropriate patients to benefit from a value-based care approach where you have a really integrated wraparound serve capabilities. So, it\u2019s certainly true on all of that. I am going to slightly disagree with your premise here. We are not in the business of targeting a certain type of member or patient. We want to look after Medicare patients and members, whether they are community MA, whether they are dual special need, whether they are complex or not, whether they are early in their disease in an aging patent or advanced in their disease and an aging part. And then the job for our organization is to mix and match our capabilities to do that as efficiently as possible. And the great thing about Optum Health, David, is that we have such an interesting portfolio of capabilities, which allow us to dial up and down our activities in response to what the patient needs and the way in which they need to be looked after. So, I would say, we are going to be continuing to lean in across the board. It\u2019s just as important to us to grow in dual special needs as well as community MA. And I would say that the progress we make in terms of impacting these folks\u2019 lives and the reason why over 90% of members describe this as a high-satisfaction space is because they \u2013 these people need the support at this stage of their life. And we think that between the programs that UHC offer and then the backup that Optum Health brings in terms of deep clinical engagement really makes a difference, and that\u2019s what drives us. David, appreciate the question. Thank you very much. I am afraid we are at the end of the call. I hope you leave this call with a sense of our optimism and focus on continued growth for the year ahead. We remain intent on expanding our ability to help improve healthcare at the system and individual levels and executing with excellence for all those we serve. And we look forward to sharing our progress on this journey with you again in July. In the meantime, thank you so much for your questions and your attention this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: And with that, that does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release, we issued this morning and in our form 8-K dated October 15, 2024, which may be accessed from the investor relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you saw in our release, the people of UnitedHealth Group continue to deliver on our growth pillars. Our teams are providing more people with more high-quality health care services and benefits and restlessly looking for ways to simplify the health system and deliver more value for patients, employers and providers alike. By the end of this year, we will have grown to serve more than 2 million new consumers with commercial offerings, fulfill more than 1.6 billion prescriptions through Optum Rx and care for 4.7 million people in value based arrangements. Our people have done all this and more in a challenging period, navigating the first year of the CMS Medicare rate cuts and its impact on member mix. The effects of the state driven Medicaid member redeterminations, certain novel care patterns and the changed health care cyber-attack. While many of those factors could not have been anticipated, thanks to our people's efforts, we can affirm a full year 2024 earnings outlook still within the range, we first offered back in November 2023. It's a distinctive part of the culture of UnitedHealth Group that we continue to strive to deliver on our financial commitments to you through changing environments and unforeseen challenges. As we look to 2025, and I will address this shortly, we remain in a dynamic period for the healthcare sector. Amid this, it's important that we continue to invest in the durable value creating capabilities of this company that support our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective. We will balance our commitments to investing in the promising future before us with managing the known and potential challenges. We remain highly optimistic for the future, even as we are respectful of the pressures the sector faces again next year. Even within this environment, we're well positioned to continue our growth in the years ahead. I want to highlight two important reasons for this optimism. First is our relentless focus on execution, quality and innovation. In particular, we continue to work tirelessly to improve people's experiences with the health system. To that end, this month, we launched a first of its kind national gold card program, which will reduce the number of prior authorizations by 500,000 every year for qualified in network providers. This can help improve both the quality and the affordability of care while reducing friction in the system. Artificial intelligence is starting to be an important tool in improving our work. Our advanced practice clinicians use AI to summarize lengthy patient histories, freeing up hundreds of hours that can be better spent caring for people. Our nurses use Generative AI to review documentation more efficiently, saving time and improving patient service. AI is helping our consumer advocates, powering tens of millions of consumer interactions and provider searches. This allows our advocates to spend more time with people on more complex inquiries, driving better efficiency while also improving the consumer experience as reflected in higher NPS scores. And finally, using AI to help build software is enabling technology engineering teams to enhance the speed and quality necessary to help drive our technology modernization. Our focus on execution and quality is also evident in the Medicare Advantage plans we are offering for 2025. Once again, we focused on consumer value and as much as possible on benefit stability, even as we navigated the adverse Medicare funding environment. With annual enrollment beginning today, we believe we will continue to be a top choice for consumers. A second element underpinning our growth is delivery on our commitment to the transition of the health system to value based care. For over 20 years, there has been a bipartisan consensus among healthcare experts and policymakers that value based care that is integrated, patient centered and outcome focused care is superior to the often fragmented and unnecessarily expensive fee for service system. Across four presidential administrations, CMS has called for private public innovation in the development of value based care models in Medicare and Medicaid. It provides better outcomes for patients. It saves money for the customers and taxpayers who fund care. And it empowers clinicians to focus on providing the most beneficial care. The rationale for these decades long effort to develop value based care is both simple and sound. It moves from incentives based solely on volume to incentives based on a patient's health outcomes and experience. And it helps ensure patient care is delivered not at the highest cost sites of service, but rather those that combine the highest quality and value. The effectiveness of value based care for patients is proven and powerful and it's good for the system. At UnitedHealth Group, we're purposefully organized to support the transition to value based care. It requires deep engagement with patients, setting the foundation to move setting the foundation to move to more coordinated care, connecting patients to primary care earlier driving clinically accurate diagnoses, more effectively recognizing and managing chronic conditions, and slowing disease progression. We're seeing the benefits of this work come to fruition. People served by OptumHealth's value-based care models are more likely to receive cancer screenings and be in better control of their diabetes and hypertension than people in fee for service in Medicare and 10% less likely to visit the emergency room or be re-admitted to hospital program. One example of the impact of better care coordination is our emergency room space discharge program, which helps patients who may be at risk for unnecessary and expensive ER use and readmissions. We have learned that the specific ways in which a discharge is managed can have a substantial impact on readmissions, which are a problem for both patients and facilities. Our nurse care managers proactively engage the emergency teams to provide them relevant information from the outpatient medical record and to facilitate a safe discharge. This approach, currently in eight markets, is already helping to avoid hundreds of inpatient stays each month. It preserves emergency resources for those, who truly need them, saves money and is a better experience for patients. Our many care offerings now serve people in value-based care arrangements in dozens of service areas, integrating primary, surgical behavioral and home care. These patients come from many diverse payers and employers, a clear sign of confidence from the market that we're on the right track. This is the value proposition of UnitedHealth Group, committed to serving patients, providers, payers and customers with quality, integrity and innovation and joining with federal and state governments in the effort to help to build a better health system that meets the needs of all stakeholders now and into the future. Fundamentally, we continue to grow, because more people and organizations are purchasing more of the products and services we offer. It's a simple statement to make, yet a hard thing to do year in and year out. But it's the enduring reason for our optimism about the long-term growth and future of this enterprise. Now I'll turn it over to John Rex, our President and Chief Financial Officer.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Andrew. Strong growth across the company sets us up well to deliver upon our commitments to you. Amid all the puts and takes of this unusual year, we are seeing what we always look for. New products and innovations taking root among customers, more people being served through our services and continued improvement in the experience people have. These are key to our long-term success. I'll start today by offering some observations on care activity patterns, as we know that is most likely top of mind for many of you. Certain care patterns persisted at higher levels than we expected in the period for three specific and we believe primarily transitory reasons, two of which we noted last quarter. First, the still pronounced upshift in coding intensity by hospitals, which we flagged last quarter. In some cases, the coding actions are extreme. Certain entities have been notably and persistently aggressive, having up shifted their coding intensity factors by more than 20%. We are actively addressing this unnecessary additional cost burden to the health system. The second item, also noted last quarter, is the continued timing mismatch between the current health status of Medicaid members and state rate updates. States often use care activity data that is well over a year old in setting their rates. That typically has minimal impact when member mix levels are relatively stable. But with eligibility redetermination significantly shifting, both the number and average acuity of people covered has changed. As a result of the lagging care activity data as well as the annual rate cycle timing, updates remain well short of current care activity, a factor that for us was more pronounced through the period than anticipated. A third item that emerged more substantially in the period was a rather rapid acceleration in the prescribing of certain high cost specialty medications, primarily those used to treat cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer. We believe a contributing factor to the acceleration was the Inflation Reduction Act, which eliminated the individual coinsurance requirement during the catastrophic coverage phase. As many of you know, more people enter this phase in the second half of the year. While we anticipated this will become a more meaningful factor in 2025, drug manufacturer campaigns pulled some of this activity into this year more sharply than anticipated. With that, let's turn to our Q3 results. Revenues of $101 billion grew more than 9% over the prior year, with strong growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. OptumHealth revenues grew by over $2 billion and are approaching $26 billion. This was driven by an increase in both the number and type of care services we offer and the patients we serve, especially in the home and among those with complex needs. OptumRx revenues grew by over $5 billion to more than $34 billion driven by strength in our pharmacy care offerings, as well as growth in pharmacy benefits management from new customers and expanding specialty services. OptumInsight revenues in the quarter were stable, approaching $5 billion and the nearly $33 billion revenue backlog increased by more than $1 billion from last year. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our domestic commercial business has added more than 2.4 million people through the third quarter. Selling season indications are tracking favorably as we head into \u201825, reflecting continued strong uptake of UnitedHealthcare's innovative offerings. Our Medicare Advantage plans on offer this fall balance providing as much benefit stability as possible for seniors, while contending with the CMS funding cuts, IRA changes and expected care patterns. The initial stars ratings for plan year \u201826 for consumers in four-star or better rated plans is largely consistent with what we saw in our initial results last year. As has been the case in recent years, we expect these percentages to increase. In Medicaid, our new state customer expansion and retention performance remains strong, including recent awards in Massachusetts, Colorado, Rhode Island, Florida and Michigan. We hope to continue to support people and families in the post-redeterminations period and are advocating with states to ensure adequate funding and resources for these often underserved people. Our capital capacities remain strong and continue to underpin our long-term growth objectives. In the quarter, cash flows from operations were $14 billion or 2.2x net income and year-to-date we\u2019re nearly $22 billion. So far this year, we have returned $9.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase. Additionally, we have invested more than $11 billion in a wide range of strategic opportunities; including updating and extending our long standing and productive relationship with AARP to better serve older Americans. As highlighted last quarter, after the cyber-attack, we prioritized devoting resources to support care providers, over some activities such as share repurchase. Payments and claim flows for most care providers have normalized, and repayment of these capital advances is underway. Regarding Change Healthcare, for full year '24, we now estimate the business disruption costs will be about $0.75 per share, an increase of $0.10 from the former midpoint. As you may recall, business disruption largely encompasses the loss of revenues combined with the cost of keeping these capabilities fully ready to serve. These effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. We continue to work with customers to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and to win new business with our now more modern, secure and capable offerings. We expect to continue to build back the business to pre-attack levels over the course of '25 and estimate next year's full year impact will be roughly half of the '24 level. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing our '24 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $27.50 to $27.75 to reflect business disruption impacts and the care patterns we discussed. Our company's ability to deliver within the range of the commitments established nearly a year ago, even in challenging circumstances is another example of the discipline and innovation of the enterprise and the confidence we have in delivering diverse growth for the long-term. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Before we turn to your questions, I want to provide some preliminary observations about next year, which we'll review in more depth at our upcoming investor conference. Perhaps the most important element is that our businesses are operating well and our growth potential remains strong. We see continued momentum in the selling season performance for UnitedHealthcare's commercial business and Optum Rx, which both offer best-in-class innovation and performance for customers. The consumer value proposition of Medicare Advantage continues to be highly compelling and we see strong growth potentially in this market for many years to come. The Optum Health value-based care businesses that we've been building for well over a decade are beginning to approach the very early stages of their potential and will be a key differentiating growth factor in the years ahead. At the same time, and as we build for the future and contemplate our 2025 outlook, we're taking into account several unique dynamics. First, the concurrent timing of the second year of the CMS Medicare rate cuts and the most significant Inflation Reduction Act impacts into a single year and the negative effects of that on the people we serve. Second, within Medicaid, the timing mismatch of state customer rate actions, which do not yet reflect the higher acuity of remaining consumers. And third, a respectful view of the care activity that John noted. We're actively addressing and managing for these and continuing to believe our 2025 planning assumptions appropriately capture these components, though we will be prudent in an initial early view. The majority of those 2025 factors are expected to be most impactful to the UnitedHealthcare businesses. As a result, we anticipate stepping out for 2025 more conservatively than is typical. At this distance, we expect the upper end of the likely range will offer in December has been around $30 per share. As always, we will seek to advance beyond this initial view as the year progresses and we remain committed to and focused on our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth objective. We see 2025 as a year of opportunity in building to that commitment, so you will see us investing in our growth pillars aggressively, modernizing our company with AI and other technologies and always exercising discipline in our operating performance. We look forward to discussing this with you in much greater detail at our Investor Conference on December 4 in New York. Now operator, we'll take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thank you for the comments. John, I want to go back to where you talked about your observations here in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about some of those that you expect to impact \u201825? And I really want to focus on the third one, which you talked about the rapid acceleration in Rx, but you also talked about the positive impact that you're seeing within your OptumRx business on the specialty side. How do we think about that playing into 2025?\nAndrew Witty: Let me ask John to start, then I'm going to ask Brian, UHC to make a couple of comments, and then we'll come back to Patrick at OptumRx. It's a wide range and set of impacts that you're alluding to. So let me start with John.\nJohn Rex: So just a few comments here and maybe kind of shape some of these messages here. So first of all, in terms of what we would expect to persist, what we expect to subside here. So I'd start with our planning assumptions, as Andrew noted, we're looking for some of these elements here. What was different for us in the quarter than the thoughts we would have had at the end of last quarter is, most notably, what we saw in terms of the rapid increase in the specialty drugs. And we'll get a little bit more to that. There really was a midyear issue. We think really tied into the IRA and the components that shifted for that. And as you look at some of the prescribing patterns that are out, those shifted sharply in the second half of the year. And we would have been planned on some of that happening really more next year. The pull forward in this year was one of those elements that was a bit unexpected. I think the other elements are probably more understood out there. The timing mismatch in Medicaid has been in the conversation, what we've been seeing in the provider in the providing coding intensity also more understood. So maybe we'll go around a little bit to Brian Thompson, let him address some of those elements.\nBrian Thompson: Sure, John. As John mentioned, specialty Rx, again, largely contained to our Medicare Advantage book. And let me start with, I feel very adequately priced for how this will play out in 2025, despite the surprise here in the second half. And you might ask how that's possible. What we had done is planned for the IRA to drive a greater induced utilization as it continued to roll out with the biggest elements being in 2025. Obviously, there's a lower out of pocket maximum for consumers in 2024. We expected that to play out more in 2025. We're seeing that accelerate into 2024, but not at levels that would suggest we're not at levels that would suggest we're not covered for it in 2025. Again, we thought it would be a little more gradual. We've certainly seen some manufacturers doing some promotion. I believe that's also contributing. But, certainly feel good about how we priced for it in 2025 because we did anticipate these step-ups, particularly with the large scale changes and more richness and benefit for consumers that will come to play out in 2025.\nAndrew Witty: Patrick, maybe just reflect on it from an OptumRx position.\nPatrick Conway: In terms of OptumRx, first, I would call out volume where we had a record PBM selling season last year that plays into this year and renewal rates in the high 90s. The growth in mix, including in specialty, drives significant revenue growth for us. I call it pharmacy services, which as you know, Lisa, in our specialty arena, significant growth but also infusion, hospital health system and our community pharmacy platforms, and then new products and services, including around specialty, whether it's Savings IQ, which has saved consumers over $1 billion this year or Price Edge, where we have over 9 million members and saved consumers $125 million or our [wait engage], we've got a number of new products and services around the specialty arena that continue to deliver value to our customers. We're really purpose built to help our customers manage specialty spend.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: I appreciate the early comments on 2025. I wonder if -- relative to sort of a normal year of 13% to 16% growth, is there any way to sort of size some of the different headwinds and tailwinds you're looking at to formulate what looks like at $30 is about 8% growth?\nAndrew Witty: A.J. thanks so much for the question. Let me just context this a little bit. First off, as you would see in a typical year, we'd always start the year with the plan to obviously deliver but ideally beat and that will continue to be the culture of the organization. We are clearly in an unusual situation right now in terms of the various pressures that we've seen coming externally from particularly government funded reductions and to some extent the continued strength of MedEx cost. Probably net-net, all still somewhat hangover effects of the COVID pandemic still playing through the system, both in terms of volume and also some pressure on unit costs that we've seen, all of which you see in the kind of pressure that we see this year. Now, as we think about 2025, what we're trying to set out here, A.J. is something really important for the long-term future of the company. Those external pressures which we've described, I think, clearly both in the press release and in the commentary this morning, we're being clear about what they are. At the same time, what we mustn't do is pull away from investing in what's going to drive the future of this organization over the next decade. What does that mean? That means, really making sure we're investing in filling out and continuing to build out our value based care platforms. It means really leaning into taking advantage of the technology opportunities, which now exist in reality. So the chance to really modernize our full stack across our organization, transform the way in which we develop new products, give us opportunity to bring forth a new look, OptumInsight based on much newer technologies, give us the opportunity to transform consumer experience, something which is sadly lacking across U.S. healthcare. All of those things are opportunities we sit right now. They sit in the same year, as we have these various headwinds that we've been talking about. And so, what we're doing for 2025 is we're putting in place what we believe is a really responsible plan, really focused on making sure, we don't pull back from investment in the long-term, not shortchanging the next decade. And that's what we're leaning into in terms of making sure our \u201825 plan is responsible for longer term value creation of the organization. Now as I said at the beginning of the response to your good question, A.J., we're always going to go into every cycle aiming to do better than we lay out at the beginning. But I think it's appropriate for us to make sure that we build a plan for 2025, which acknowledges the external pressures and make sure that we retain the capabilities to continue to build what we think is a really distinctive set of capabilities, which will play out very powerfully for the next 10 years. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Thanks for the color on the MLR factors that you called out. When you think about the Q3 MLR unfavorably developing in the quarter, is it fair to think that all three of those factors were about the same? Or would you call out one of them as maybe being larger? And when we think about the coding and utilization management, I guess, operationally, what needs to happen if you're to make progress on this front? I don't think you've attributed much of this to midnight rule to date. Can you update us on whether that changed at all in the quarter? And maybe if not, where the pressure is manifesting on the coating side?\nAndrew Witty: I'm going to ask John to start and then ask Brian to give you a little bit more perspective on that also.\nJohn Rex: And yes, I would say in the quarter versus our initial expectations that we shared with you a quarter ago, it was really they were all roughly in the same zone in terms of impact in the quarter, those elements that we called out kind of give or take, but they're roughly in the same zone as we look at them. Brian?\nBrian Thompson: As it relates to upcoding new inpatient stays versus what we feel is more appropriately build as outpatient, we did expect that behavior to somewhat subside here in the third quarter. Last quarter, we had talked about the timing of that spike being largely related to our own utilization management waivers during the cyber-attack, but it certainly has persisted. As John mentioned at the outset, this is a few large systems driving it. We certainly do remain focused on evaluation of this practice. It's a key part of our utilization management. The difference between an inpatient and outpatient stay is largely borne by our consumers on an already too expensive cost of care in a hospital setting. So we remain vigilant on focusing on this, hoping to see it abate to levels that we're more used to seeing in the past. And we'll continue to review this as we look forward. Right, Brian. Thanks so much. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: There seem to be more moving pieces to the Medicare Advantage landscape than usual entering 2025. So maybe can you just take a step back and speak to your strategy over the next few years? And specifically, how important is growth in Medicare Advantage to UnitedHealth's overall enterprise strategy? And then maybe a potential weakness from competitors changes how you think about coming to market?\nAndrew Witty: Josh thanks very much for the question. Let me just make a couple of comments and then ask Tim Noll, who leads our MLR business to go a little deeper for you. And obviously, very timely given that today is the first day of the selling season for the new MA year going into 2025. So as you look across the whole of UnitedHealth Group, Medicare Advantage, of course, is a very important part of the business, but it is one of several different pieces of what is really a very diversified group of health care businesses. There are obviously linkages from Medicare Advantage to Optum, in particular obviously through Optum Health and elsewhere. But I would say over time, what you're seeing is as important as MA is, you'll see many other elements of the business continue to grow, and that's critical for the long term the long-term sustainability of the company, of course. That's why we've laid out the five growth pillars of the business over the last two or three years, Josh, as really signpost of where you should expect us to deploy capital. It's where we put our mindshare. It's where we look for opportunities to improve the health care system. So, whether that be in benefit design, whether that be in building our value-based care, bringing new technologies to the marketplace, transforming and modernizing pharmacy or bringing forward what ought to be a state-of-the-art financial services capability into a part of the economy, which represents 20% of GDP. Those are the five growth areas of the company. MA is an important element within all of that, but it is one of several key opportunities for us to drive forward. Having said all of that, as we come into this cycle, I think, what we're seeing is the benefits of some very thoughtful, calm, not over reactive planning last year. I think the way in which the team led us through 2024 in terms of benefit design has proven out to be on balance, right, given the very, very many moving parts that you correctly alluded to. I think that sets us up in a good place in terms of how we enter this year. We'll see how this cycle goes. I'll ask Tim to give more comment. But most importantly, it really gives us confidence as we look out over the next four or five years that we're not we don't feel like we're having to fix significant problems that were avoided, if you will, that we didn't make those step mistakes a year ago, which is always a thing to worry about in this situation. We have a lot of moving parts. It's critical not to be over reactive. It's critical to be very much consumer patient centric, and that's really been the guidepost that we followed. And I think it served us well. Tim, I think, is going to serve us well this year.\nTim Noel: Thanks, Josh, for the question. Yes, and I would underscore some of the pieces that Andrew mentioned. And also, yes, it is a very dynamic period right now in the Medicare marketplace. But our strategy and our vision here for the business really doesn't change a lot. I'll just underscore a couple of those that are key to this environment today. One is that, we've always had a long-term planning view and that's never more important than it is today. Right now, that includes a very rational response in any particular year to the revenue pressures that the program is facing. You saw that play out for us in \u201824; you'll see that continue to play out. As Andrew alluded to, that ensures that we don't have any deferred maintenance and pricing carryover into a subsequent year, given the environment that we're in. Along with that, we always strive to provide as much stability as possible to consumers in any one year. In this year, in 2025, that has meant preserving PCP co-pays of $0 for our consumers, and trying to do what we can to make sure that co-pays are near zero for the most commonly prescribed medications as well. And then also to preserve as much choice as possible that we have for consumers that's really important for Medicare beneficiary that we design products and plans that meet their needs and listening to what consumers want will always be a core element as well. Lastly, and this is really important is, this environment is continuing to create more value. And the headline there is around our partnership with our value-based care providers. That's the best opportunity for us to continue to create value in light of some of the pressures that the program is facing and we continue to see great opportunities there. And that's what we're leaning into right now. Finally, the newest technologies that are emerging around AI and ML are giving us some really nice opportunities to provide more efficiencies in our operation and be able to pass those efficiencies along to beneficiaries and then be another and there'd be another considerable way that we offset some of the headwinds of the program. So yes, very dynamic environment, but really our strategy and some of the core principles and foundations of our Medicare Advantage programs don't change.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks Tim. And I just want to thank Tim and his team for if you just step back, Josh, and you're super well aware of this. And you just look at the amount of regulatory change, change in funding dynamics, IRA coming into the marketplace, insufficient growth coefficient in terms of future MA funding on top of V28 cuts. What Tim's team has done is basically try to neutralize a lot of that volatility and noise in terms of how it flows through to touch patients and members. It's really important that stability, never more important to have that -- than in this cycle we're in right now. Because otherwise you would see tremendous amount of, I think, disturbing volatility flow through into the market. And we're not going to do that. We are going to put our patients and our members first. We're going to strive to do everything we possibly can to give them a fantastic experience. By working with Optum, we believe that for many of those patients, we can introduce them to an unparalleled set of quality outcomes, both in terms of care and cost and experience. And that work has never been more valuable than when you see the kind of volatility that we've seen last year. And we're going to see again next year because of the things that have already been announced. And what you're seeing us plan for is how to work through that. We're not going to sacrifice long-term potential of all of what we've built in this short period of volatility. What we're going to do is work to insulate members, make sure that members have great experience. And today is the first sell in day and hopefully, lots of folks are going to be picking up the line to UHC today. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Given all the volatility you've been -- we've seen in the sector, I was hoping you could share with us some incremental color on how your Medicaid business ex Duals and your Medicare Advantage business including Duals are performing in the third quarter and for the full year of 2024 relative to target margins. And maybe also give us some color on the expected pace of potential improvement that's implied within 2025 guidance, if there is any improvement expected?\nAndrew Witty: Let me ask Brian to respond.\nBrian Thompson: Let me start with Duals, and I would say we remain very encouraged about the outlook for our duals business. Certainly, about the position of those products as we approach 2025, I think that will be a growth element for us. Inside 2024, obviously, we talked about it in our prepared remarks last quarter as well as this quarter. One of the three items contributing is the pressure we see from redeterminations. And that's obviously impacting our Medicaid book. I'd like to say that we probably weathered the storm on the volume impact of redeterminations, and that's now behind us. What we're really looking at now is how do these rates catch up to where our current cost trends are. And I think we've seen some strong momentum with our state partners, but it's not yet responsive to the trends that we're seeing real time. And we're hopeful that through our partnership and our advocacy that we'll close this gap on funding at a faster rate than maybe normal rating cycles would suggest. But the key items in the quarter, again, were just higher volumes of disenrollment. And if I was to point to one element beyond just the traditional acuity of those that left and those that stayed that we had planned for, I'd point to behavioral care. Many of our states have looked to us to expand access to behavioral care. And I think many of us that partner with our states have done so. That does have some cost implications. So we're really hopeful that these states will be more responsive than traditional rating cycles would suggest and that we'll see these tailwinds soon as we pace through this big year again of largely the volume being the driver of the implications in year and now hopeful that we'll see these rating cycles catch up to our cost trends that we're seeing emerge.\nAndrew Witty : Great. Brian thanks so much. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : I was hoping just to toggle over to the commercial business and how some of those -- I guess, those three elements, obviously, excluding the Medicaid one, but the other two elements that you talked about that were -- costs were coming in higher than expected. Just if you could maybe sort of bifurcate that between commercial group and then commercial individual and I guess how you're seeing those flow through into both of those markets. And then just on the individual side, just how that informs your view on how you've priced your exchange products for 2025, and sort of comfort with the margin trajectory there?\nAndrew Witty : Let me ask Brian to give you kind of an overarching view and then maybe pass to Dan Kueter to give you a little deeper on the commercial business.\nBrian Thompson : Yes, Scott, thanks for the question, it provides me an opportunity to clarify. The three items that we mentioned at the outset and throughout really aren't a part of our commercial business. What we've talked about, obviously, redeterminations in the Medicaid space and the other pressure points around inpatient stays and specialty -- largely around Medicare Advantage. I feel really good about not only our performance, but our cost management inside our commercial business, and I'll hand it to Dan Keuter, our CEO of that business.\nDaniel Kueter : I can offer that in the exchange business, as you asked about, our pricing is respectful of the brand and the other market dynamics in that space, which include our product offering, our geographic footprint and the competitive environment. For 2025, we have priced with a forward view of our cost in full respect for trend. As Brian and John have noted, those impacts that are driving some trend in the government programs are not applicable to the commercial business, whether that be on the individual side or the group side. So our outlook on trend for 2025 is consistent with our view for 2024, and the drivers in the commercial business remain the things that we have discussed for some time now: provider unit cost, pharmacy cost and enabling expanded access to behavioral health services. So those have been the driver in '24. We expect those to continue into '25. And we have priced both the individual business and the group business with full respect and awareness of those trend items.\nAndrew Witty : Dan, thank you so much. And really, the two elements that Dan just raised there, the pharmacy unit cost and utilization, and of course, the hospital unit cost, are two kind of strategic areas that we really want to lean into. And we've been very outspoken for years about the need to bring down a list price of drugs. We continue to advocate very strongly for that. Until that happens, we continue to utilize all of the tools at our disposal through OptumRx to try and bring down those costs on behalf of our members and on behalf of the companies who we serve within the commercial books of business. We're also exploiting as much as we possibly can, opportunities to be leaders in how we think about biosimilar adoption and how we create wraparound programs on important areas like weight loss. All of which are designed to try and bring down essentially the ever kind of increase in inflationary pressure that we see from the drug bill, and that's an important one. The second one Dan referred to is hospital unit costs. And we've seen really some unusually aggressive and high unit cost asks, we are very much -- we fully recognize the critical role of the hospital systems and hospitals, obviously, within the care delivery environment. But we need to -- we want to continue to work to try and find new compact, a new way of working with hospitals. We want to see less abrasion in the marketplace. We believe that ought to come with more competitive rates in the marketplace. We see a critical role for hospitals as acuity needs rise and rise. But at the same time, we see great opportunity for us to partner with the right health systems to create much better value for money for the overall system. So the two areas we really want to be a willing partner to innovate. And whether that be with drug companies who are interested in new ways of working to bring down cost or whether that's with hospital systems who want to work with us to reimagine what the patient experience, the doctor experiences, and all part of bringing down the unit cost, those are areas that are super important for the long run and it's going to be a space where you're going to see us continue to be very active in terms of putting forward ideas, trying -- piloting new approaches. The national gold card program I mentioned 30 minutes ago, is just one example, and we're going to continue to look for those sorts of opportunities.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes : Could you talk a little bit about OptumHealth? And I had three points there. If you could talk a little bit about some of the drivers of margin improvement in the quarter. If you talk about the outlook for \u201825 for risk contracting. In particular, what things might be driving that as far as adoption in MA and if you're seeing adoption in other segments like employer. And then maybe a sort of related question, are you seeing any other responses in the employer segment to the high premium inflation environment that's out there, like PBC adoption, but also things like binder or whatever?\nAndrew Witty : Let me ask John just to comment on margin. And I'd like to go to Dr. Desai, who looks after OptumHealth, on your second two points, if that's okay.\nJohn Rex : A few things benefiting Optum here is as it continues to progress. Let's start with -- now this is roughly a $100 billion a year business that we've been building over the past decade or so, advancing strongly along the way and we're able to make refinements in the business as we look ahead and such. So that is -- you should expect us to see us continue to refine the portfolio that we are in the types of businesses that we're in. What is OptumHealth is mostly a care delivery business at this point versus kind of what it was maybe even five years ago. And so you should continue to see us focus the portfolio strongly on that. So we'll focus the portfolio on those businesses that make a lot of sense for us, and we will not be in businesses that don't hang as tightly with the theme we have in value-based care and where we're heading for this business for the next decade. In addition to legacy elements in there, such as maybe contracts and such that needed refinements that have been in there for a while and so moving those along, also getting them into a better zone. So really, the company performing very strongly, fundamentally in here and the type of engagement they're having with the people that they serve at OptumHealth. And Dr. Desai and his team and how they've advanced that with the engagement of the most complex patients. Those are the fundamental drivers of how that business has performed. And then our job is to make sure that we refine the portfolio, refine the elements here as we look ahead for the next decade and build.\nAndrew Witty : Great. Thanks, John. And Amar?\nAmar Desai : So first of all, we feel very good about the overall performance of OptumHealth. We are continuing to execute against our three year plan that we put in place in 2023, focused on medical cost management and affordability initiatives, clinical engagement, our operating cost management activities and then accelerated diversified growth in some of our services businesses. On that point, in particular, with services, we're pleased with the growth in our OptumServe business, where we've had new product launches in the areas of medical disability exams that have resonated very well in the marketplace and have contributed to a leading position as a clinical provider for the largest government and federal agencies in the country. As it relates to your broader question around growth across payers, we have strong relationships with over 100 planned partners and are poised to execute on a broad, diverse growth agenda. In fact, in this dynamic rate environment and benefit environment we've discussed here, we're actually seeing increased outreach from payers who are looking for really an enduring partner who can operate in capitated arrangements. In particular, a number of productive discussions ongoing around funding and market level planning as we plan for AEP, but also in other lines of business. And foundational to all of these conversations is really first and foremost, the quality of our providers anchored in the community, particularly our ability to achieve clinical outcomes, including closing gaps in care for Stars programs and HEDIS measures, the strength of that network in the geographies that plan partners are looking to grow in, and then continued focus around our clinical engagement. In fact, year-to-date, we've engaged over 80% of our members. 90% year-to-date for our highest risk members. So when I take that together, great momentum and strength to not only grow but grow in a broad and diverse way across multiple lines of business.\nAndrew Witty : Amar, thank you very much. And I'm going to ask Heather in a second just to give a little bit of perspective from Hersey the Head of Optum in terms of the value-based care ambition and where we're looking to take that particularly as it differentiates. But both Heather and I have recently been out with some of our key commercial clients, and it's been striking to me the rise in interest and -- it's a beginning, I think but the rise in interest for some commercial employers to start to explore moving to value based as an alternative. And I do think that we're going to see that start to move forward now. It's one of the reasons we've been investing heavily in some new groups, I'll call out particularly Kelsey-Seybold who joined Optum just a couple of years ago. They're really good at the leading edge of that kind of model. And I do think that we're going to see -- Lance, to your good question, I think we're going to see that start to evolve over the next few years. And we're certainly starting to see the beginnings of important employers begin to ask those questions. And there are obviously some who already do it, and I'd expect to see that trend accelerate as we go forward. But Heather, it'd be good just to share a little bit how you're viewing the overall value-based care kind of point of differentiation, maybe from a member perspective and the like.\nHeather Cianfrocco : And just maybe, Lance, thanks for the opportunity. I think you're right, you're seeing -- in this dynamic environment and a complex funding environment, you're seeing the value proposition of the value-based care in the sense that Amar described it, not just for those plan sponsors that predominantly take risk for Medicare Advantage, but we're seeing it from employers as well direct to employer. And I think the principles of it, as Andrew said, is one, they're looking for alternatives that give clear predictability. They're looking for a better member holistic experience and that means integrating their wellness programs, it means better answers and closer proximity to the wraparound services they need, including behavioral health and at times home based services. And it means, again, more predictability and the ability to invest dollars in other areas of well-being and health for our employers. The other thing I'd point out is not only to Amar's point are we continuing to invest in value-based care. And with every month, we see more aligned physicians with better tools, with better platforms with increased signals and incentives to ensure that they're focused on the outcomes and the affordability of our members. And you're seeing that show through in OptumHealth's performance. But don't forget the other services, they -- across Optum, also help our payers and our employers, including our risk and quality services that we offer through OptumInsight. Those are the administrative and clinical services, they're more high-powered, they're more universal. We're using AI to bring down the cost of those and increase the universes. And in OptumRx, OptumRx PBM services, if the employer or the plan wants it, is a value-based accountable construct. They can do a pass-through where they manage the cost or they can do an accountable construct, when we talk about our clear guarantee programs. We take the risk for all of those services, including the specialty services. Now it's really important to note, I think this is incredibly important that with guarantee or accountability, our clients don't lose transparency. OptumRx stands for transparency, but we're trying to make it simpler and we're trying to take accountability. So I would point to the value-based services across Optum and say, yes, they're resonating with payers. We're seeing that, and that's why we're so optimistic about our long-term value proposition. But every other service that Optum offers through Insight, through the Bank and throughout OptumRx contributes to that value-based mission and helps all of our clients, payers, state customers, federal customers, employers and should benefit our consumers with better outcomes and with a better experience.\nAndrew Witty : Heather, thanks so much. And Lance, thanks again for the question.\nOperator: We'll go next to [Joanna Gaik] with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: So I just have a follow-up question on the OptumHealth discussion sites question was about margins. But I want to ask about revenues. In the quarter, the revenues actually did decline sequentially quarter-over-quarter from second quarter about 4%. So -- and I know there was a commentary around streamlining the portfolio and some contracts. So, is that sequential decline and a fraction that you -- there was something that actually did already take place in the third quarter in terms of exiting maybe some underperforming contracts or business lines? So can you comment on that? And I guess, were margins also benefiting from investment income and to what degree? And then I guess for the quarter, real question is about trying to ask again what you assume for margins in OptumHealth next year?\nAndrew Witty : Let me -- I think actually the sequential is a pretty straightforward explanation, let me just ask John to give you a little detail on that.\nJohn Rex : On, yes, so the refinements that I was discussing would be the primary impact in terms of the sequential and what you're seeing sequentially in terms of revenues. And as we continue to refine the portfolio, refine contracts, legacy contracts that might be out there and work ahead on that. That would be the really prime component that we'd see in there.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nSarah James : I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on OptumInsight. So excluding change, how are -- how is the sales pipeline and margins going versus your expectations on the non-change business? And then on change specifically, as we think about its transition into 2025, is that business an earnings drag? And how should we think about the revenue being a headwind or a tailwind compared to '24?\nAndrew Witty : Sarah, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Roger Connor, who leads OptumInsight, to give you a little deeper on this. But I just want to thank and acknowledge that the tech team and the OptumInsight team more broadly for the extraordinary response to the change attack, and Joe shared you in a second, the great progress we've made in recovery in that business. Continues to be -- work to do, obviously, bringing back all the clients who we asked to go work with other folks during the attack. We did the right thing in terms of protecting the system and encouraging people to find alternatives. We're now bringing them back. We've made a huge step forward in that. That work will continue as we roll into New Year, as you heard in the introductory comments, but great progress on that. And the speed at which we will to rebuild a modern platform has been just extraordinary. And I think actually bodes very well for us in the future in terms of how we think about our speed of technical modernization as an organization. More broadly, I think it's also given us the stimulus to really, really reimagine what the future of OptumInsight is going to be, and I'll pass it now to Roger to give you a little more detail on just where we are on the recovery and, more importantly, on the non-change modernization aspects.\nRoger Connor : Thanks, Andrew, and thanks very much for the question. I think hopefully, you're going to get a sense of the confidence we feel in OptumInsight going into 2025 as we move through the change event. Maybe if I just start there, first of all, with the cyber recovery and in terms of the progress that's been going well. From a Q3 perspective, you'll see that the business disruption reduced quarter-on-quarter. I suppose where we're focused through the first half of the year has really been on the restoration of the systems, and we've made very good progress. Not really, it's all about reconnecting our customers. And as John shared, we are seeing slightly higher business disruption trend going into the end of the year, and some of that will carry over. Maybe just a couple of reasons to a little bit deeper as to why that's happening. From a reconnection perspective, customers are coming back. We're actually making good progress there. What we're seeing is the volume that's coming back isn't coming back to the pre-attack levels. And customers are really looking for vendor redundancy, what they're out there looking for is in another one or two sources of their software systems, for example. Now we understand that. We think that's a good thing for the health system, but that is having an impact on us this year. But that also creates an opportunity for us. We've got an opportunity to go out and get new customers or sales and become an additional supplier for them. So again, that's a focus. That's going to take a little bit longer, a slightly more complex implementation time. So when you add those to factors together, that's why you see that carryover impact into 2025. I think it's important just to understand just the scope of OptumInsight overall. Because if you look at our core business outside of change, which is the vast majority of OptumInsight, that's where we're feeling very confident around the opportunities that we've got through the end of this year and going into next year. And you can see that we're performing well. We've got momentum. You can see that in our operating earnings in terms of outperformance in terms of our growth year-to-year when you adjust for change. That confidence comes really in a couple of areas. One, the market needs us. The payer and provider markets are where we see real opportunity. There's significant cost pressure in that client base, and they really see our services and software as a bit of a sweet spot. That's where we can help and provide their solutions. And then where I'm actually most excited is what we're going to do in innovation and what we're doing in innovation to accelerate currently, because we're building off that new modernized tech environment that we've built this year at Insight. And we're using AI to not only transform the functionality of our current products, like payment integrity revenue cycle, but to create these differentiated products and creating this exciting portfolio of AI-driven innovations. Now the good news about Insight is that we can go and test those with our partners with UnitedHealthcare, we test them with OptumHealth. We conclude our big health system partnerships. That allows us to test these things quickly and bring them to market fast. And you're going to see us doing that more as we go into next year. So when I add that underlying market opportunity, I add that this AI-fueled acceleration of innovation, that's why I think that we've got -- we're really set up well going into 2025 and for our performance next year.\nAndrew Witty : Great. Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Mok with Barclays.\nAndrew Mok : SG&A has been a strong contributor to earnings this year. Just curious how we should think about the permanency of some of those cost changes as we look forward to 2025. Is there anything that you would call out as being more temporary in nature?\nAndrew Witty : Listen, I think you should expect us to be very, very disciplined around cost management. And again, I want to go back to first principles. I'll take you back to the investor conference last year in New York. I stood on the stage and I said, look, essentially, what you're seeing from the CMSP28 rate change is a price cut. I mean that's what it is. And the price cut requires us to respond accordingly. And a key piece of that response, if you want to protect members, which we do is we have to take cost down inside the organization, and we have to try and eliminate waste in the MedEx environment outside of the company. So, we have been relentless around how can we find sustainable cost reductions for the organization, particularly in both businesses. You see this year, I'd say, Optum, in particular, has been doing a remarkable job of taking cost out. I think there's more to go, and we will be very relentless about that. And as an organization, we recognize the payer has the right to change the price they want we have to respond. Cost reduction is a key piece of it. And MedEx management is the other key piece, and those are going to be two really important features of the future for the organization in terms of how we robustly respond to all of this. So yes, you should expect more of that and it will be a key piece of the plan going forward. We just have time for one last question, if we could take the last one, please.\nOperator: Yes. We'll take our last question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright : So you mentioned some of the internal investments just around AI and other initiatives into 2025. But what about broader capital deployment? I guess, how should we be thinking about the priorities heading into 2025 in the context of everything that's going on in and otherwise, but also just what's embedded in your expectation share buybacks or otherwise?\nAndrew Witty : And I'll ask John just to comment in a second. But broadly speaking, our capital deployment is going to be very much led by our five growth pillars of focus for the organization. So as you think about that benefits business, obviously, UnitedHealthcare, value-based care, our technology-led opportunities, our pharmacy businesses and of course, financial services. Those are going to be the areas in which we think about capital deployment. Value-based care is really the organizing principle, which binds all of that together. So that's going to be a key kind of element to that also. And then I would add to that, something we talked about over the last two years extensively is consumerization. You should expect us to continue to challenge and push on how we can constantly modernize the consumer experience that we're able to offer. Technology as a facilitator of that, but also philosophy as a facilitator of that, right? The organization is changing. It's biased to being much more consumers in the way it thinks and operates. We want to continue to bring that to life. So those five growth pillars, the opportunities, the technology of the 2020s gives us, and then a shift in emphasis from the company towards a more consumerist experience, those are really the guide points. And then, John, maybe just more broadly summarize beyond that element, if you could for capital.\nJohn Rex : So you should see -- expect our capital deployment agenda remain very much like it has the past many years, focused on expanding the capabilities of the company, orienting how we look at that orienting around our five growth pillars and where we need to be adding capabilities, clearly generating strong returns for shareholders as we deploy that capital. So first and foremost, that's always been the first priority, how can we build new capabilities for the company that will deliver strong returns for shareholders for the next decade and where should we be putting that capital. That will continue very much the same. You shouldn't see any shift on that. That's always first priority. And then we look at other elements there in terms of in share repurchase and dividend and those other elements where we can return capital to shareholders. So you should see that be very, very steady as you look to the decade ahead in terms of how we've always approached this business.\nAndrew Witty: And thank you for the question, and thank you all for your questions this morning. As we look to conclude in this year and further preparing for 2025, we're excited about the future of UnitedHealth Group. We believe we have the focus, the discipline and the adaptability to continue to grow our 13% to 16% long-term target. And we remain, as always, committed to the people we serve. Despite the challenges that we see in the environment externally, we believe at UnitedHealth Group, we have the right mix of people, capabilities, passion and compassion to allow us to not just navigate 2025, but actually in doing so, set the foundations for continued differentiated performance for many years to come. We appreciate very much your attention this morning. Look forward to having the chance to see you in person in New York at our investor conference. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are. Some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under US federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings. This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amount is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's investor relations page at www.unitedhealthgroupcom. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our form 8-K dated July 16, 2024, which may be accessed from the investor relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter results we reported today reflect diversified and durable growth and a commitment to ensuring high quality care is available to every person we're privileged to serve. In the first half of the year, revenues grew by nearly $14 billion, with strong contributions from across the enterprise, led by double-digit growth at Optum. UnitedHealth Group entered the second half of the year with continuing and broad-based growth momentum. As a result, we are affirming our full year adjusted earnings outlook even as we absorb $0.60 to $0.70 per share in business disruption impacts related to the cyberattack. These results come from the sustained focus of the 400,000 people of UnitedHealth Group on adding value for patients, consumers and customers through the fundamental execution of our key priorities. We're also well positioned for growth in 2025. In the selling season to date, the most sophisticated thoughtful buyers of health benefits and services in the US, such as large employers, unions, states, seniors, all continue to choose the offerings of UnitedHealth Group, when they're looking for managed care, pharmacy services or a Medicare Advantage plan that provides the best value. This consistent growth reflects customers' recognition of the need for a company like ours. As you know, UnitedHealth Group strives to help reduce the fragmentation and lack of coordination that drives up costs and erodes care outcomes in the $5 trillion US healthcare marketplace. We aim to better coordinate and align incentives among caregivers, payers, and pharmacy, enabling us to focus on the whole patient throughout their health journey. We believe this increases value for customers and consumers, improves people's experience and health, reduces redundancies and waste, and ultimately leads to a more sustainable health system. For example, the proven health and economic value to consumers and taxpayers of Medicare Advantage. A recent study by Milliman found that the cost of taxpayers of Medicare Advantage is 4% less than traditional fee-for-service Medicare. At the same time, Medicare Advantage provides seniors well over $2,000 per year in additional value through lower out-of-pocket cost and important services like dental, vision and hearing, none of which fee-for-service Medicare covers. That means a lot to the majority of the people Medicare Advantage serves, who have limited economic resources and otherwise would lack access to such services. The home visits we offer seniors further illustrate the value of MA. Last year, our medical professionals made more than 2.5 million home visits. As a direct result, our clinicians identified 300,000 seniors with emergent health needs that may otherwise have gone undiagnosed. They connected more than 500,000 seniors to essential resources to help them with unaddressed needs such as food insecurity, medication affordability, transportation, and financial support. They also identified and helped close more than 3 million gaps in care that made a real difference in people's lives. Within 90 days of one of our home visits, 75% of patients received follow-up in a clinical setting. Additionally, Medicare Advantage patients with chronic conditions who receive these home visits end up with better managed and more stable health outcomes, as evidenced by spending measurably less time than fee-for-service patients in emergency room and other hospital settings. The bottom line, our home visit programs help patients live healthier lives and save taxpayers money. It is only Medicare Advantage that makes programs and results like this possible. Similarly, Optum Rx clients continue to appreciate the efforts we make to ensure delivery of the lowest cost drugs in the face of drug companies' sole ability to set prices. They also recognize the importance of the comprehensive pharmacy services we provide to people that's driving our momentum this year and bodes well for 2025. We also continue to bring practical innovation to people through new products and services, and by using new and emerging technologies to improve our own operating efficiency. For example, Surest continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace, which is why more and more customers are offering it to their employees, and why the offering continues to grow substantially. Additionally, investments in modernization of legacy technology and new emerging technologies are enabling our consumer-centric advancement of healthcare. For example, our growing AI portfolio made up of hundreds of practical use cases will generate billions of dollars of efficiencies over the next several years. These investments enable us to improve consumer experience, enhance provider find and price care capabilities to meet people's needs and improve clinical back-office execution. We expect technology innovation to become an increasingly core driver of our growth over the next two to five years. And now, I'll turn it over to our President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Andrew. I'll start this morning by providing context on some of the unique items in the quarter. Then, I'll follow with perspectives on care activity and general business updates. The overarching theme I hope you leave with today is that UnitedHealth Group continues to deliver broadly diversified growth with expanding opportunities, work that positions us for continued strong performance in '25 and beyond. Now to update on Change Healthcare. Our focus has centered on the patients, care providers and customers who rely on us to keep the health system running. Payment and claims [slows] (ph) for most care providers are back to normal, but we know that is not the case for some, so we continue to work with those who are not there yet. UnitedHealth Group has provided more than $9 billion in loans and advance payments to help providers mitigate the impact of the attack, all at no cost to them. Cyber impacts in the quarter totaled $0.92 per share, and we now estimate the full year impact will be $1.90 to $2.05 per share. But let me break that down a couple of steps further for you. Of the total in the quarter, $0.64 per share were direct costs incurred in restoring the clearinghouse platform and other response efforts. These included higher medical expenses directly stemming from the temporary pause of some care management activities. For the full year, we now estimate these direct costs at $1.30 to $1.35 per share. The $0.40 to $0.45 per share increase in this estimate is primarily related to care provider financial support and costs for producing and mailing the consumer notifications that will begin later this month. As a reminder, these direct costs are included in net earnings but are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The other component affecting our results relates to disruption of the ongoing Change Healthcare business. This largely encompasses the loss of revenues combined with the costs of keeping these capabilities fully ready to serve. Notably, these effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. In the second quarter, this impact was $0.28 per share. For the full year, we now estimate the business disruption impacts at $0.60 to $0.70 per share compared to the $0.30 to $0.40 we estimated last quarter. Most of the service functionality is now restored and revenues are rebuilding even as the pacing of this process varies. These important services are now more modern, secure and capable, and continuing to advance rapidly. Our ambition continues to be to return to baseline performance in '25 and to grow strongly from there. Turning to international. Following the sale last quarter of our much larger Brazil operations, we classified the remaining South American businesses as held for sale. This is a natural step following the Brazil sale. We highly value the relationships we have built with our dedicated colleagues over the last several years and wish them continued success. In a diverse enterprise with a strong growth record and capabilities such as ours, such portfolio evolutions enable us to keep our focus on the many compelling growth opportunities before us. The second quarter includes a total of $1.3 billion in South American impacts, the majority of which is non-cash and largely due to foreign currency translation losses accumulated over the years. About $220 million of this stems from a regulatory action in Chile, affecting all health plans. You'll see that as a component in the supplemental financial tables we provided this morning. The action relates to industry premium increases dating back to 2020, but as configured, will be reflected in consumer premium credits to be issued in future years. As a result, the entire $220 million was recorded as a reduction to premium revenue in the second quarter, increasing our reported medical care ratio by about 25 basis points. Turning to the second quarter medical care ratio, it was also impacted by about 40 basis points, or $290 million due to the suspension of some care management activities after the cyberattack. That makes for a total of about 65 basis points of non-repeating impacts, including South America. Beyond these effects, the care ratio in the quarter was also modestly affected by three other factors. One being member mix within Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans, which this year has been shaped by the unusual competitive benefit configurations in the marketplace. A second being the timing mismatch between the current health status of remaining Medicaid members and the state rate updates, a timing mismatch we expect to realign in the months ahead. And third, the lingering upshift in provider coding intensity, which we believe was spurred by the temporary suspension of our care review activities and carried past. This impact is not reflected in our cyberattack direct response costs, and we have been addressing it. Nonetheless, we continue to expect our full year medical care ratio, excluding 30 basis points of cyber and South American effects to be within the range we offered in November, albeit at the upper end. For our 2025 Medicare Advantage planning process, we assumed care patterns and mix at the levels we are seeing today, in addition to fully incorporating the second of the three-year phased funding cuts, and we have been fully attuned to how the Inflation Reduction Act will affect Medicare Part D offerings in '25. Also, as noted, we expect the Medicaid timing mismatch to subside as rates are updated throughout the remainder of this year and into next, appropriately reflecting current member health status. Turning to the performance of our businesses. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of $74 billion grew by $3.6 billion. UHC domestic commercial membership grew 2.3 million in the first half of this year as employers and consumers responded to our distinctive offerings. And while the '25 selling season is ongoing, we are encouraged by the continued momentum we see. Our recently filed Medicare Advantage bid for '25, again took a balanced approach to provide as much stability for seniors as possible, while factoring in the realities of the funding cuts and current care patterns. You can expect us to continue to prioritize balanced and durable performance over transitory market share gains. In Medicaid, we expect membership levels to stabilize as we head into the second half of the year and our teams are executing well with both renewals and expansions. Optum Health revenues grew by 13% to $27 billion, and the operating margin expanded over last year. We are on track to approach 5 million patients in value-based care by the end of this year and are progressing strongly on our earlier and deeper engagement with patients, with a purposeful focus on our newer regions to more rapidly improve health outcomes and experiences. Optum Rx revenues grew 13% to over $32 billion, driven by strong customer response to the differentiated value, consumer experience and clinical expertise we offer. At Optum Insight, for the services beyond Change Healthcare, we see strong performance in line with our expectations. The revenue backlog increased to nearly $33 billion, growth of over $1 billion from a year ago, driven by business process and information technology services for health systems. A few additional items of note. As we highlighted in April, we established an additional $800 million in medical reserves in the first quarter to reflect the potential for the cyberattack to have affected claims receipt timing. With claims now flowing at more normalized levels, we continue to prudently analyze these trends. Similar to last quarter, the second quarter results do not reflect any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development. Days [and] (ph) claims payable at 45.2 compared to 47.1 in the first quarter. The change was due primarily to the return to more normal claims submission patterns from providers and to a lesser extent, some impact from reclassifying the remaining South American operations to held for sale. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were $6.7 billion, or 1.5 times net income, even with the accelerated funding for care providers. In June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 12%, marking the 15th consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases to shareholders. During the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we prioritized devoting resources to support care providers in the wake of the cyberattack over some activities such as share repurchase. It was the right thing to do, devoting all our efforts to provide stability for the health system. Still, with our ongoing strong capital capacities and with support needs abating, we expect to achieve the full year repurchase objective we shared with you last November. In summary, it is the confidence we have in the performance of our diversified businesses that allows us to affirm full year adjusted EPS in the range of $27.50 to $28.00, the objective we established last year. Even as we have absorbed the unanticipated $0.60 to $0.70 in business disruption impacts. Within this, we expect a balanced pacing in the second half. Now, I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: John, thank you. As I said in November at our investor conference, we operate in an environment where change is constant. What you've come to see is that when changes happen, foreseen or unforeseen, we just deal with it. UnitedHealth Group is a nimble and adaptable enterprise, well suited to meet the challenges that come our way and the opportunities we pursue with the many and diverse capabilities available to us. In this first half, as we've done before, we navigated a complex external environment while managing through a significant business disruption. We continue to deliver on our growth objectives and are committed to delivering on our 13% to 16% long-term growth target. We'll now answer any questions you might have. Operator, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, thanks for the question. Just to make sure, expanding on John's comments, if we're thinking about the -- your thinking on MLR overall for the rest of the year, it sounds like beyond Change, beyond Latin America, there's two items you're calling out. One is Medicaid timing mismatch, which sounds like you think it\u2019s short term and then this upcoding, coding intensity comment. And I assume that's mainly in the insurance business, but maybe it's in Optum as well. Can you just give us a sense of how much those are impacting your thinking? And how much is second quarter versus the impact in the back half on those?\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, A.J., thanks for the question. Let me ask John to get right to it.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, A.J. Yeah, and really kind of three items that we're talking to in addition to those two here, also the member mix component here when you bring it all together, those additional items that we're looking at in terms of -- versus where we were and how we're thinking about it. I would say they\u2019re in kind of roughly equivalent -- in roughly equivalent zone in terms of their impact here. And then how they flow throughout the year -- the rest of year, really, you'll see some of those elements. So, as it relates to Medicaid impacts, pricing goes on over a period of, say, kind of 12 months or so. So there's pricing that occurs over the rest of this year into next year. So those elements in terms of catching up -- that mismatch catching up with the acuity that we have in the remaining population occurs over a period. Certainly, we are addressing the elements we talked about in terms of what we're seeing in the coding up shift, and we're well underway in addressing those elements, but we'll continue to address them throughout the course of the year. The member mix is kind of the member mix we have now at this point. And that really pertains to just the elements that I mentioned in my prepared comments about some of the benefit design impacts and how that impacted both our growth and also the type of membership that we were left with as we saw our full configuration. That really lasts with us throughout the year. So -- but that was an element we also incorporated into our view for 2025 as we approached our bids for '25. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Well said, John. And maybe just to reiterate one thing John said and then maybe add a further point, A.J. Super important just to hear what you said in terms of that member mix, obviously, we deal with it during this year, but we obviously had the opportunity to incorporate into our '25 planning and bids. So, feel very good about that. And then the secondly, maybe just to reflect, step back just a little bit on as we think of MLR. Really, the biggest incoming dynamic on MLR at the beginning of this year was the funding reduction in MA, the V-28 significant reduction in funding. And you can see that we are fundamentally navigating that, I think, extremely well. And yes, there are a couple of areas of pressure at the margin. I think as you just heard from John, they're primarily boxed off in terms of they're going to work their way through the pricing cycle with Medicaid or in the case of concerns around coding activity, we're very focused on that, confident we'll be able to -- we are addressing that. So those things feel transitory. Most importantly, we feel good about the way our response to the V-28 funding cut is playing out for us in the overall business. And really that -- as we started the year, that was the much bigger thing to make sure we got right, and I'm feeling like we're well on our way through the first year of this three-year cycle, and we've talked to you repeatedly about how critical it is to make sure we navigate that over the long run, and we feel good about that. So, thanks, A.J. Next question?\nOperator: Yes. We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. I want to focus for a minute on SG&A, which came in much better than expected. Can you maybe talk about the key components of where you're seeing cost savings, the durability? And, Andrew, you touched a little bit about AI efficiencies there. Are you starting to see that in this quarter? And how much opportunity is there from an SG&A perspective when we think about AI?\nAndrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask John to comment a little bit. Let me make a couple of kind of upfront comments and then maybe a couple of examples more specifically to help you a little bit on this. So, to get your last point, we are running now hundreds of AI use case deployments. I'd say the first wave of those are essentially allowing us to do things much more quickly, much more reliably, much more efficiently than humans can do them. So an ability to navigate complexity to find answers within complex datasets. And super important, and I'll give you a couple of examples of how that begins to help us as we go on. I think we are now -- you will also start to see as we roll through the end of this year and next year, those same kind of tools begin to be deployed in fundamental reimagination of business process. So one is essentially allowing an existing process to run more efficiently. The second is, can we actually take steps out of a process and really start to change things. I'd call out payment integrity as a front-runner in that particular regard. And you'll start to see a lot of movement there over the next year or so, Lisa. And it's going to be, I think, OptumInsight '25, '26, '27 in terms of deployment of technology to change many of the processes that we've been used to for decades is coming, and that's going to be a very exciting phase. If you look in the short run, I'll give you a couple of examples. And this plays a little bit around technology. I certainly wouldn't say these are all Generative AI examples, but they're certainly digitization examples. They are certainly technology-enabled examples. So for example, we brought on this year at OptumRx a record number of clients. You've seen the growth. You can imagine the number of folks who've been signed up into Rx platforms. We actually spent 9% less this year in the onboarding of that record volume than we did the prior year, 9%, that\u2019s entirely due to digitization, technology efficiency deployed through the organization. Let me take you into another part of the organization, OptumHealth. We've more or less increased our number of risk -- fully risk delegated lives within OptumHealth by about 40% over the last two years. That's -- by the way, that's in excess of 1 million -- almost 1.5 million more lives over that period with zero increase in personnel headcount in the risk-based businesses. So, zero increase in headcount in a business which has increased its served members by close to 40%. So those are just a couple of examples. You're seeing that show up in those two examples, Optum. That's why you're starting to see that leverage flow through the Optum business line and it\u2019s something we obviously expect to continue to sustain over many, many quarters and years. And, John, I'd love you to go a little deeper.\nJohn Rex: Yeah. Good morning, Lisa. As you can -- I guess I'd start by -- it is early in that journey in terms of the potential and opportunity for what we can do. And yes, it was a very strong quarter in terms of cost management. But let me just step back a moment here. As you can imagine, given how some of these businesses were built and the fragmentation of the system, there are duplicative functions and uneven consumer experiences throughout that we're addressing. And as our businesses begin to scale, our ability to produce efficiency accelerates while, at same time, we can improve those customer experiences and expand the best practice across the broader base. The comments that Andrew was offering in his answer to your question, it's just really a natural outgrowth as these businesses begin to move beyond what we have viewed the earliest phases to a more adolescent phase. That's what we're seeing. Very strong this quarter. Over the longer term, we can expect advancement. I wouldn't expect it to remain at this level consistently as we look ahead over the next few quarters, though. It was a super strong quarter. But we are going to look to invest in many of these items that Andrew just articulated here, getting to a more modern streamlined experiences as these businesses evolve further. So I wouldn't expect it to persist right at this level as we make those investments, and we're anxious and ambitious to make those investments.\nAndrew Witty: Great. So, Lisa, thanks for raising it. You can tell it's a big focus for us. We laid out when V-28 first was announced, that one of the three ways that we would respond to this is we would double down on our own cost management efficiency and productivity, you're absolutely seeing that. And that coincides with an extraordinarily and exciting moment around technological innovation, whether that's Generative AI, digitization, all wrapped together in our march toward a greater consumer focus within the organization. All of that really hangs together is very much the core focus of how we think about things going forward. Thanks, Lisa. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Looking at your bids that you submitted for MA for 2025, I'd be curious if you could tell us if you were bidding to improve MA margins in 2025, or if you're still within that target range in light of the G&A savings? And then more importantly, maybe just some early thoughts on what sort of growth assumptions you have included in those bids, both your assumption for the market as well as any potential market share gains?\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Josh, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to address the first part of your question. On the second part, you're not going to be surprised. I'm going to defer from making any predictions about next year. It's still a little early. We'd like to see where everybody else plays out in this cycle. I think we [also are] (ph) in the 2024 cycle. Ultimately, the way growth plays out in the marketplace depends on how everybody bids, not just on how you bid. And it only takes one bid to be kind of out of expectation to completely distort your view of how things could play out. So, just going to defer a little bit on that one, but on the first point, Tim, I'd love you to make a few comments.\nTim Noel: Thanks, Josh, for the question. So, as we think about margins in the MA business and as it relates to our bid, I think we've talked about the consistent approach to how we plan margins. And we maintain -- continue to maintain that and we're operating comfortably within that margin range as we have in the past and as we're planning in 2025. And then when I think about our pricing approach for 2025, as Andrew mentioned, too early to get into a lot of specifics as CMS is reviewing those bids right now. But we're in a posture and how we've priced those products as we'll be comfortable with whatever growth is the outcome of the products that we bring to marketplace in 2025.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Tim. And, Josh, appreciate the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Can you speak in a little greater detail about your expectation that the Medicaid pressure starts to subside in the second half of the year? I guess specifically, can you maybe speak to what you actually know about rates today, either draft or finalized, versus perhaps speaking to a general reliance on actuarially sound rates playing out over a reasonable period of time? Just trying to understand the level of visibility that you have a bit better. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Okay. Hey, Stephen, thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Krista Nelson, who leads our Medicaid business to respond to that. Kristen?\nKrista Nelson: Yeah, thanks so much for the question. So as it relates to visibility, we've got visibility into the majority of our rates for \u201824. And while there's just a slight gap in the second quarter, we really like how our 7/1 rates are shaping up and continue to work with state partners to influence key assumptions before those rates become final in the future. And while we might see a little bit of dislocation the rest of the year, states have really committed to accurately reflecting the change in acuity from redeterminations into current and future adjustments and really expect this to even out as we pace through the remainder of \u201824 and early \u201825. Thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Krista, thanks so much. So I mean, listen, Stephen, I think you heard there why we're confident that this is really a kind of time-fenced issue and in the grand scheme of things, I would characterize this as a margin. It's a part of what you've seen in this small deviation in Q2, but we don't really see it as a sustainably structural issue and you heard exactly why just there. So, thanks, Krista. And, Stephen, thanks for your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Just a quick clarification and then a question about second half MLR. So first, the clarification. On the MLR, it sounded like, John, you're guiding to a core MLR at the high end of the range or 84.5%, and then I would add 30 basis points of the one-timers for the full year that you've seen in the first half, that would leave GAAP MLR at 84.8%. Is this correct and to be clear, is there any expectation for further one-timers in the second half of the year? Or should the third and fourth quarter kind of be clean? And then my question is just around, core MLR in the first quarter, ex the one-timers was 84.2%. Sounds like it'll be 84.8% in the second half. Maybe you could help us think about 3Q versus 4Q just to make sure our expectations are set correctly, given how much focus there is here. Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Justin. I\u2019d say first, yes, the way you described our assumptions around core full year MLR are consistent with our expectations. So how you describe that is quite consistent. As it relates to just looking at towards the 3Q and such, I'd expect that to be in the neighborhood of 84%, very likely a few tens of basis points higher than that. So, it's kind of a little bit above that in that zone. As it relates to kind of other elements that we've pulled out here, no, they shouldn't be material. Those cyber effects should continue to abate. As we mentioned, we're not adjusting for the elements we talked about the provider and coding intensity, so that kind of pulls through a little bit. But there shouldn't be any material other impacts that we're thinking about. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Thanks, Justin. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Actually, I was hoping we could maybe do a similar exercise as Justin just asked about with MLR for OptumHealth margins. And maybe first, if you can talk about how the OH margins came in at 2Q relative to your expectations. And then how you're thinking about OH margins progressing in 3Q and 4Q? And then how comfortable you are with getting into that -- the full year target range that you had provided. And, John, I thought it might be helpful to -- as we think about the sort of pacing in the back half of the year, in particular, how you're thinking about an exit rate for OptumHealth margins as we're exiting 2024 would be helpful? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Scott, thanks so much for your question. I'm going to ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads OptumHealth to give you a few comments there. I mean, let me just preface that by saying, look, we feel good -- very good about the continued progression and in particular, the way in which OptumHealth is -- has adjusted to deal with the new funding environment. I'm also very, very encouraged by the degree of external payer engagement with our OptumHealth platform as they deal with the environment themselves and look at Optum as a part of that solution. And I think the performance of the business you see is, it continues to improve over last year. You continue to see decent progression. And let me ask Amar to give you a little bit of a sense of how he sees the second half of the year playing out.\nAmar Desai: Hi, Scott. Thanks for the question. So as Andrew said, we're in the middle of the first year of a large rate reduction over the next three years, effectively being a price cut. And as we think about the initiatives, we're pleased with the early success, mitigating the impact of that changing rate environment. In '23, we developed a three-year plan to manage through V-28. Medical cost management and affordability initiatives was at the center of it. Proactive clinical engagement that impacts member experience and total cost of care is obviously core to that, including better prevention and chronic disease management and then disciplined operating cost management, more efficient ways to work, improvements in productivity, driving consistency in our workflows and systems, which Andrew and John alluded to. We're executing very well on this plan, seeing solid progress across each of these areas. As an example, at this time last year, we had engaged 62% of all members. Year-to-date, we've engaged three-fourth of all members and above that for our highest risk membership. We're also focused on coordination of care, particularly at transition points in care, where we've increased post-discharge visits for patients who have been hospitalized that has, in fact, reduced readmission rates by 10% in our most mature markets. So, as we pace through the balance of the year, we expect to continue to build on this momentum across engagement, affordability and operating cost management and are confident in the 7.7% to 8% target for the year.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Amar, thanks so much. And, Scott, thanks again for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Just wanted to clarify, I guess, something and ask another question. It wasn't clear to me what you were saying about no favorable reserve development. Does that mean the $800 million that you mentioned previously is still somehow in the numbers? Or is that kind of worked its way through at the end of Q2? And then I guess just trying to understand better where the outperformance is because obviously, you guys have assumed $0.60 to $0.70 of Change costs in your guidance but reaffirm the numbers and it doesn't sound like Medicare is the answer, doesn't sound like Medicaid is the answer, Change isn't the answer. So where has the outperformance come in that\u2019s allowed you to maintain guidance? Thanks.\nJohn Rex: Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. This is John. So yeah, exactly what we said there was nothing material there going on in development. No favorable P&L impacting development in the quarter, very similar to last quarter in terms of there was just no impact being there. And in terms of just a comment -- or questions regarding outperformance, well, maybe some across a number of the businesses in terms of where we're seeing, we're seeing very strong growth, certainly in our commercial health benefits business, we're seeing strong growth. We're seeing margin progression in OptumHealth. So we're seeing advancement. The -- really, the strong approach that the team at M&R took and tell how they looked at '24 in terms of overcoming the headwinds at V-28 and the very disciplined approach they took to how they stepped out into the marketplace with the products that they took. Even with some of the elements that we talked about that we\u2019re overcoming there, but certainly, all those creating a good impact from us. Clearly, just across the company, the strong operating efficiencies that the company is driving, strong and sustained. And as I said, look, we will continue to make investments, but really a significant progress on that and still very early stage. So as Andrew commented in terms of the potential we have as we look over the next three years and this impact, and we're just getting some of these businesses to a maturity level where we think we can really harness that. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah. Thanks, John. And let me just also reiterate that point. I mean part of what you're seeing here, Kevin, is obviously, the big change this year was the V-28 funding cut price reduction, which obviously focuses primarily on our Medicare Advantage business that Tim runs and the OptumHealth business that Amar runs, both of whom are responding super well. But let's be clear, while those pricing cuts are focused on two businesses, team UHG is responding, right? The entire corporation is engaged in how it manages itself better, reduces cost across the company, leverages technology, accelerates our consumer agenda, all designed to play our part across the board in how we offset the pressure that's been inflicted on those two important businesses. Why we're confident we can navigate this? I think you're seeing that in the performance of the business, and we're going to continue -- it\u2019s why I said what I said earlier today. We're going to continue to focus on every aspect of our business to make sure that the model we've laid out and we believe is the right one for delivering best value care for patients is the one that prospers and we're super confident in that. Next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Mok with Barclays.\nAndrew Mok: Hi, good morning. The OptumInsight backlog was down about $200 million sequentially. Can you give us color on the drivers of that and the nature of conversations you're having with providers following the cyberattack? Do you expect further declines in the backlog this year? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Andrew, thanks so much for that. Let me ask Roger Connor to address that. It's pretty straightforward. But let me ask Roger to answer that and maybe give you a little bit more flavor on what he's seeing.\nRoger Connor: Yeah, Andrew, thanks very much for the question. Just in terms of backlog, obviously, an important measure and there has been some impact from the Change events within that. What it doesn't include, obviously, is what we're doing in terms of bringing in new clients and what we're doing in our whole innovation space. But fundamentally, we are very confident in terms of the performance going into next year with the cyber event certainly from an impact on the overall health system is not absolutely minimal. When you look at our overall focus, it's now on driving that business recovery. And that's all about bringing volume back into the system. And we're seeing that actually really ramping up and seeing momentum acceleration. We're not only trying to bring volume back into our current customers. We're also going to bring new clients in, and that's exciting because this event has really transformed the marketplace. They're looking for, again, access to innovation, access to security in the system and that\u2019s what we've brought back. We've brought back a very secure system, and that is resonating or seeing that momentum. You add that to the underlying strength of the OptumInsight business. Again, Change is only 15% of our overall business performance this year, was planned. That's why we're confident in terms of getting back to our baseline performance in 2025.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Roger. Thanks, Andrew. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the provider coding activity that you called out and asked maybe what you saw kind of change in the quarter and what actions you're taking to address this change? And is this pressure something that accounted for in bids for next year? And then if I could just ask a very quick clarification on the Change impact on EPS. You talked about the return to baseline performance in 2025. Does that mean you would expect to recover the $0.60 to $0.70 [that is in] (ph) earnings this year? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Okay. Thanks so much for the question, Nathan. Brian, if you'd like to go first?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. I'll answer that first part on the upshift that we saw in provider level of care coding patterns. We actually believe that was largely induced by our level of care waivers that we did during the cyber disruption. The reason we believe that is we really saw a higher level of mix to inpatient versus observation after we went back to turning on our utilization management protocols. Pretty distinct on April 15th and thereafter. So that's why we see that. Certainly aware of that activity as we plan for 2025 in our bid. So, really no concerns with respect to that. I feel like it's an anomaly tied to what we saw during our waiver. And we have reinforced our utilization management protocols and believe that these impacts will dampen as we pace through the remainder of the year.\nJohn Rex: Yeah. And regarding Change, yes, as we mentioned in our comments and Roger mentioned, our ambition is to get back to baseline expectations performance for that business in 2025. So those baseline expectations being what we would have expected prior to any of this happening. And clearly this quarter, we have increased the impact of the business disruption here. So as we bring those back, there's the pacing of those revenues coming back, taking sometimes a little bit more time to bring in, but that is our ambition, actually, as we look ahead.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John, Brian. I mean, again, just on this business interruption piece, I mean, I think in all honesty, we were a little optimistic in hindsight at the pace at which we thought people would come back in terms of putting their flow through the system once it was reconnected. I think as we've looked at the last several weeks, that momentum and pace, and particularly as we look at new clients come in and as well as returning clients feel good about where we are now. So I think probably a little overoptimistic three months ago. I think now, I feel like we have this now and we're in good position and the rest of the year we've got a clear path how this plays out. And I think the platform that we've rebuilt is going to serve people extremely well. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. So on the earlier topic of potential offsets, I wanted to ask on Optum Rx and with the recent level of industry attention kind of on the PBM business as well as kind of specialty pharmacy, how should we think about how those drivers are playing out relative to your expectations, whether it's biosimilars or GLP-1s in terms of that therapeutic category, how should we think about those near-term drivers across Optum Rx? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Erin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Heather, who runs Optum for us, to make a couple of comments on that, if you don't mind, Heather.\nHeather Cianfrocco: Sure. Just basically, I think you can see in the quarter, just strong performance, maybe a couple of things I would just highlight for that. We've talked for a few years about the investments we've been making in Optum Rx on both the PBM side, but also on the pharmacy side. PBM side, you've seen the growth there in client and just in volume, sort of same with respect to volume within our existing clients as well. We take that as a sign of strong retention of existing clients and continuing to perform with them. I think the thing I'd highlight on the PBM side is, I've said this before, the modular effect of the PBM business. We serve at the privilege of our clients, so what they need, we serve, And that is we administer their benefit. And we offer the programs, the services to drive affordability of medications for them in the best interest of their members. And we've brought a lot of products and services in the last year. Two or three new products this market that are leading differentiating in the marketplace that we are seeing our health plans and our employers take advantage of this year that are really market differentiating and we are seeing that drive not just growth with health plans, but growth in products and services. So I think you're seeing that show up. The other thing you're seeing is the cost efficiency show up in the business. One of the -- Andrew brought up an example. And you're seeing some of the timing of supply chain efficiency. On the services side of the business, you mentioned specialty, I call out the diversification of the pharmacies in general. Remember, we've got the integrated behavioral health business which continues to grow and expand. It's a very differentiated business in that it's co-located and it's specifically directed at those behavioral health members to ensure access and affordability and holistic care to individuals with mental health conditions. And then our frontier and our infusion services that really drive those specialty medications in-home, we're seeing continued need for that from our PBM clients, but also non-PBM clients. And so that's where we're really seeing that diversified growth. So you're just seeing that show up in continued, consistent performance in that business through the quarter.\nAndrew Witty: Heather, thank you. Erin, thanks so much for the question. We have time for one final question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Great, thanks. For OptumHealth, could you talk a little bit about what pricing has been like there? And, in Investor Day, it seemed like you may have seen some improved pricing as far as global cap rates, and likewise given higher global cap rates out of the MA business. Was wondering if \u201825, we should be expecting continued improvement in that, or whether there needs to be a retrenchment or retracing of that kind of makeup for what was given? And also, are you starting to exclude things from global cap as you look at 2025? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Lance. Thanks for the question. And love the cheeky attempt at the end of the call to get us to predict, give you some numbers for \u201825. We're going to defer from that, but well done on the last-ditch effort. I'm going to ask Amar to give you a little bit more of a kind of general sense of how we're seeing that. And please go ahead, Amar.\nAmar Desai: Thanks for the question, Lance. Look, we continue to have very strong relationships across our over 100 plan partners. And in fact, in a pretty dynamic rate and benefit environment, we've seen increased outreach from payers looking for an enduring partner that's very adept at operating within fully capitated value-based arrangements. In particular, the discussions have been productive around benefit design, funding, market level planning and we're confident in the position as we go into 2025. We're down the path in adding plan partners as well as adding geographies for 2025. Foundational within that to those relationships and as we think about those arrangements is quality, quality of care of our providers that are anchored in the community, our strong ability to drive clinical outcomes, improvements and achievement in star measures, and of course strong documentation and diagnosis. We also are seeing that the strength of our network that's aligned in geographies is an important focus area for plan partners, and of course continued focus on clinical engagement which I mentioned previously. So when you take that together, great momentum across those areas gives us confidence as we drive value for our plan partners and as we pace through the next two years of the risk model changes and grow.\nAndrew Witty: Amar, thank you very much. And as I think you could probably sense from those couple of answers that Amar has given you over the course of the call, Amar leads a very, very special team of people running a very, very special business in terms of what it\u2019s able to do on behalf of patients and the way it's able to provide great work experience for the healthcare professionals and colleagues who work in that business. I'm very pleased with how the continuation of that business progresses. We're coming toward the end of the call. I'd like to thank you all for your questions this morning. As you've heard, our focus on fundamental execution, our restless spirit, and our ability to adapt to changing environments gives us great confidence as we look ahead and as a testament to the hard work and discipline of the people of UnitedHealth Group who work every day to serve patients, consumers, and care providers, customers efficiently and effectively. We appreciate your time this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference.

Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 16, 2024, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.\nAndrew Witty: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We have a lot to cover. First, we'll discuss the status and impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, then we'll turn to the performance of our businesses, which continue to grow and perform well. It's important to underscore at the outset that even as we have devoted significant attention to addressing the Change Healthcare attack, the vast majority of the 400,000 people of this enterprise have remained as usual, intensely focused on delivering for all those we serve. That dedication is reflected in our overall performance this quarter. Directly as a result of their hard and -- hard work and the broad performance of our diversified businesses, we're able to reconfirm our full year adjusted earnings outlook, even as we absorb $0.30 to $0.40 per share in business disruption impacts related to Change Healthcare. Now turning to Change Healthcare, this was an unprecedented attack by a malicious actor on the US health system. We promptly disconnected the affected services and turned our focus to two main areas, restoration and support. The attack disrupted the ability of care providers to file claims and be paid for their work, we moved quickly to fill this gap. Fortunately, we were able to bring to bear the substantial resources of UnitedHealth Group to drive the recovery and begin to mitigate the impact. Resources, which are standalone to Change Healthcare, would not have had access to on its own. These are the resources and the philosophy that underpinned our remediation of healthcare.gov back in 2013, and our distribution of CMS COVID emergency relief funds to care providers in 2020. Here, we assisted care providers in financial need, providing over $6 billion in funding, all at no cost to them. We rapidly deployed resources to develop alternative solutions and move promptly to restore claims and payment services. We've made substantial progress and we will not rest until care providers' connectivity needs are met. And to help care providers mitigate workflow disruptions and help ensure the uninterrupted delivery of care, for a period of time, we suspended some care management activities. I'm immensely grateful for our colleagues who continue to work tirelessly day and night to restore services, free up funds for providers, and protect the broader health system. Let me touch on two more items we know are of interest to you. First is care activity. The central point is that overall care patterns are consistent with what we anticipated last year heading into 2024 and within the outlook we shared with you in November. The second item is the essential value of Medicare Advantage to seniors. Here are what we see, some of the core facts regarding Medicare Advantage. It drives better health outcomes, provides a higher-value, significantly more comprehensive benefit for people, all at a lower cost to beneficiaries and taxpayers, and is more popular with and valuable to seniors than traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage consumers spend on average 45% less on premiums and out-of-pocket costs than those in traditional Medicare. That translates into nearly $2,400 in savings annually and several times more for the country's most underserved and medically challenged populations. That's one of the many reasons why more than half of seniors choose Medicare Advantage today versus 30% 10 years ago and why we believe these offerings will continue to grow strongly for years to come. 2025 is the second year of the significant three-year phase funding reductions to Medicare Advantage introduced by CMS last year. Here, in early 2024, we're at the beginning of our thoughtful responsible three-year plan we developed last year to adapt to those changes. Our strategy continues to focus on providing as much stability as possible in the reduced funding environment. Improving outcomes and experiences for the consumers we're privileged to serve, and delivering the performance you expect from us. We believe our long-term perspective and the deliberate multi-year approach we began last year is serving us well, putting us into a position of sustainable competitive strength. Among a handful of notable business developments to share, UnitedHealthcare was honored to secure major Medicaid wins in Virginia, Texas and Michigan. While we're disappointed in the outcome in Florida, we'll be seeking to better understand the process and considerations there. There is a substantial pipeline of Medicaid RFPs and we're confident that our offerings will resonate in other states as well. UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits continued their momentum from last year, growing to serve two million more people in the first quarter, the largest increase in years. This growth was across UHC's commercial customer segments from individuals up through the largest of employers. This is further evidence of our innovative and consumer-centric products have established the footing for sustained growth. We also see continued momentum at Optum Rx, coming off last year's record-selling season with a recent win in Hawaii and the renewal of our contract with the Department of Veteran Affairs. We're grateful for the opportunity to support them. And Optum Health is tracking well to achieve its objective of growing to serve another 750,000 patients in value-based arrangements this year in partnership with many payers. Before I turn it over to John Rex, our President and Chief Financial Officer, I want to acknowledge Dirk McMahon, recently retired after more than 20 years of service, I'd like to thank him for his leadership and partnership. Dirk has left an indelible mark on this company through the example he set and the many of our leaders he has mentored. John?\nJohn Rex: Thank you, Andrew. This morning I'll first provide color on some of the unique items in the quarter directly related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, followed by care activity trends, business updates, and finally thoughts on the remainder of '24. But first, let me start at the most fundamental level. The UnitedHealth Group businesses continued to grow and perform well during the quarter, and we are encouraged by the momentum and the many opportunities to serve we're seeing across the enterprise. On the Change Healthcare cyberattack, as Andrew noted, our guiding focus throughout has been to make sure patient care is delivered and care providers' access to funding is secured as we work to bring back services fully. The cyber impacts in the quarter totaled about $870 million or $0.74 per share. At this distance, we estimate the full year impact will be $1.15 per share to $1.35 per share. Let me break that down into its key components. Of the $870 million, about $595 million were direct costs due to the clearinghouse platform restoration and other response efforts, including medical expenses directly relating to the temporary suspension of some care management activities. For the full year, we estimate these direct costs at $1 billion to $1.15 billion or $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. It's important to note these direct costs are included in net earnings, but are excluded from adjusted earnings per share. The other component affecting our results relates to the disruption of ongoing Change Healthcare business. This is driven by the loss of revenues associated with the affected services, all while incurring the support and costs to keep these capabilities fully ready to return to service. Notably, these effects are not excluded from adjusted earnings. In the first quarter, this impact was about $280 million or $0.25 per share. At this distance, we currently estimate the business disruption at $350 million to $450 million or $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share for the year. This, of course, will depend on the ultimate timing of service and transaction volume restoration. These elements are broken out for you in the supplemental tables provided with our press release this morning. Of course, we will provide regular updates on our progress and outlook throughout the course of the year. While much of Change Healthcare's functionality and services have been restored, we are working hard to restore more and the objective we all share is for an even stronger Change Healthcare to be fully returned to expected performance levels next year. I'll come back to some of these elements in more detail in just a moment. Turning to underlying care patterns. The headline is that these continue within our expectations. Outpatient care activity among seniors remains consistent with the elevated levels we began seeing in the first half of '23 and for which we planned. So we continue to be comfortable with the outlook we established last June when we filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage benefit offerings. The winter seasonal activity we discussed with you in January, particularly related to strong vaccine uptake, higher respiratory illness incidents, and related physician office visits has subsided. Overall inpatient care activity also remains within our expectations. The first quarter medical care ratio at 84.3% included roughly 40 basis points or about $340 million related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities. These have been recently reinstated. The majority of the remaining $325 million of full year medical expense impact included in our outlook will land in the second quarter. Notably, we did not reflect any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development in the quarter. Out of prudence, due to the potential for the cyberattack to affect claims receipt timing, we reflected an additional $800 million of claims reserves. We'll continue with a judicious view as we progress over the next several quarters. Turning to the performance of our businesses. The most important takeaway is they are growing and performing at a level, which allows us to maintain the adjusted earnings per share objectives we established last November, even while taking on the business disruption impacts of the Change Healthcare attack. At UnitedHealthcare, revenues of $75.4 billion grew nearly $5 billion. Within our domestic commercial membership, we're off to a strong start, powered by disciplined growth, serving 2.1 million new consumers in the first quarter. We are encouraged by the momentum and positive customer response to our differentiated offerings and look forward to building further upon that momentum heading into '25. For Medicare Advantage, as you would anticipate, we are deeply into our '25 planning activities. As we finalize our '25 benefit designs over the next several weeks, we will build competitive offerings that once again appropriately reflect the funding and cost environment. We approached this last year with a deliberate three-year plan, which continues firmly on track and positions us well going into '25. Our Medicaid business ended the first quarter with 7.7 million members. As Andrew noted, key wins in Texas, Virginia, and Michigan demonstrate the value state customers see in our offerings. In Virginia, UHC was the highest-scoring plan with particular strength in member-centric care, benefits and service delivery, quality, and value-based payments. In Texas, UHC was awarded the maximum number of possible service areas, expanding the number of people we will have the opportunity to serve. And in Michigan, UHC achieved perfect scores in such critical consumer-centric areas as social determinants of health and health equity, further solidifying our value proposition. Optum Health's revenues grew by 16% to $26.7 billion, as we increased the number of patients served and are on track to approach five million patients in value-based care by year end. For the most complex patients that Optum Health serves, we have engaged 75% through the first quarter this year, a significant increase in the number of patients engaged over last year. This reflects progressively earlier connectivity with patients and the ability to improve their health outcomes and experiences more rapidly. Optum Rx revenues grew 12% to $30.8 billion, driven by new client starts, continued expansion within existing partnerships, and growth within pharmacy services. Optum Insight, as you know, is where the Change Healthcare business resides. In the quarter, about $500 million of the $870 million total impact is within Optum Insight. Just under half of this are direct response costs, think clearinghouse restoration activities, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings, and slightly over half are the business disruption effects, which are not excluded from adjusted earnings. For many of the impact of Change Healthcare services, transaction volume drives revenues. So the effect of the attack in the period is one of keeping all the lights brightly burning at full readiness to resume services, while revenue production was essentially suspended. To be clear, the Optum Insight team did the critical and right thing, promptly shutting off services and finding any method possible to keep the care system working, including helping clients find alternative solutions. Coming out of this incident, the team will be working tirelessly with customers to recover transaction volumes and demonstrate that Change Healthcare is ready to serve and is more valuable than ever. Beyond Change Healthcare, the Optum Insight revenue backlog increased to nearly $33 billion, growth of over $2 billion from a year ago, driven by health system partnerships to provide business process and information technology services. A couple of other items of note that were affected by the cyberattack. Days claims payable in the first quarter were 47.1 compared to the 47.9 in the fourth quarter '23, and 47.8 a year ago. The accelerated payments to care providers and the Brazil sale reduced what would have been our reported measure for the quarter by about three days. The medical cost payable balance increased $1.6 billion from year-end '23 to $34 billion. The change reflects a $3 billion increase in the incurred but not yet reported component or IBNR. This is a result of the prudent ongoing claims receipt assessment, offset by a $1.6 billion reduction in the fully processed claims component, due to care provider payments acceleration. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were $1.1 billion, impacted by about $3 billion due to the funding acceleration to care providers and collection extensions to affected customers, and were additionally impacted by the timing of some public sector receipts. To summarize, a continued focus on better serving patients and the health system underpins our mission and growth drivers, which remain strong. And as we move further into this year, the broadly strong performance across our enterprise allows us to continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $27.50 to $28.00, even as we incorporate a $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share of business disruption impacts. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Witty: Thank you, John. As we look out over the next several years, we, like many others, see a healthcare environment in need of improvements in quality, value, simplification, and consumer responsiveness. While we're a comparatively small part of the $5 trillion US Health System, UnitedHealth Group's strategy is focused on helping to meet those very needs and we're well-positioned to do so. Our focus on understanding opportunities to align incentives, notably led via our value-based care offerings, demonstrates what can be achieved through partnership and realignment of ways of working. Our commitment to improving all we do for consumers stimulates our drive to help bring care to patients, where they need and want it, at prices and with an experience worthy of the 2020s. We have a proven commitment to making available our insights and innovations widely and quickly throughout the market alongside our relentless multi-payer orientation at Optum. We remain committed to partnering with others throughout healthcare to help make the health system more modern and responsive. Our success depends on enabling partners and customers outside our company to succeed. The combination of this strategic design, strengths, and behaviors underpins our high confidence in our ability to navigate the inevitable environmental change and challenge, and it reinforces our confidence in our ability to perform and grow strongly as you have come to expect from us. With that, operator, we'll turn to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and thanks for all the comments. I just want to go back to your comment around your three-year plan as it pertains to V28, does the 2025 final bid change anything around that plan? And how do I think about the impact in the quarter of V28 in both Optum Health as well as on the UnitedHealth side?\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Yeah, as we've said a few times and certainly repeated this morning, we've looked at the changes that CMS finalized last year really thoughtfully and we see this as a three-year strategy in response. Obviously, it's phased in over three years. We want to make sure we don't do anything that chases short-term growth, for example, but puts a lot -- puts at risk long-term sustainability. What you're also not going to see from ours is a kind of knee-jerk reaction between growth and margin. We want to be very focused on ensuring that year in, year out, we're a super reliable performer in this environment. As you look at the most recent final rate, I don't think it really changes the story. Obviously, a little disappointing that we don't think CMS really reflected what we've seen over the last year in terms of actual in-market medical trend. But in reality, it's just a little extra pressure for '25 on top of what we'd already seen previously. We're well-positioned for that in terms of all the work we've been doing really from the get go last year. Really from February last year, we've been getting ourselves lined up for this. You're seeing that reflected in Q1 in a few really key features, right? So you're seeing really strong cost control inside the company as you'd absolutely expect us to do, making sure that we're not incurring any expense that we don't need to support our members and patients on the outside of the organization. You saw us take a very thoughtful bid strategy last year, and of course, we continue to focus on how to make sure that we manage medical cost as effectively as possible, ensuring quality of care delivered and avoiding waste. All of that plays through. I'm very, very pleased with how this first quarter has played out in that respect. If you look at the performance of Optum Health and our MA business within UnitedHealthcare, both very strong performance during this quarter despite the pressure that's been incurred on them from the rate notice last year and I think that bodes super well for the rest of this year and the strategy that we've laid out for the next three. Thanks, Lisa. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you just explain what medical costs you categorized as accommodations to support care providers? I think the UM management that you guys are talking about, what a certain medical -- what puts a certain medical expense in that bucket? And then when you look at your actual claims received or claims processed inventories, what percentage of a normal or expected quarter did you actually see in the quarter versus how much did you just sort of put into IBNR?\nAndrew Witty: Josh, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Brian Thompson in a second just to give you a little bit more color on the first part of your question. Listen, I think by the time we got to the end of the quarter, we had the overwhelming majority of what we'd anticipate in receipt -- in terms of claims received into the organization because it's always a little bit tricky to be absolute about that, because you're kind of comparing against what you would have expected, and as you obviously know, every quarter you see corrections both up and down in terms of actual claim submissions catching up with what you may have estimated and that's been obviously the feature of this marketplace. But overall, I would say, UHC claims receipt was very, very close to normal by the time we closed the quarter. But maybe, Brian, you could give a little more color commentary on how you would characterize some of that relief we gave.\nBrian Thompson: Sure. I appreciate the question. Yeah, Josh, I believe we started March 8th and what we did, I call it foregone utilization management protocols and those are really in two categories. The first is we suspended our inpatient level of care reviews, where we assess for appropriateness of inpatient versus outpatient and that was the lion's share of our adjustment and we've got a long history of understanding those elements. It's just a unit cost adjustment. So pretty simple and easy to estimate and adjust for. The second element inside those practices was some outpatient prior authorizations that we also suspended. Those were a smaller element inside this quarter. Those will play out a little bit more in next quarter as you think about that lag between notice and actual incurral date. But again, pretty easy for us to estimate. These are practices we've had in place for a very long time and feel comfortable about the adjustment that we made.\nAndrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And just again to confirm, as you heard from John, we brought those processes back into play in the last few days. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Congratulations on working through all this. Maybe just to make sure I understand a little more, the $800 million reserve that you're holding out and you did comment, you didn't take any prior period development to the bottom-line. I guess it sounds like you've used the word prudent several times in describing that. How much -- just maybe to follow-up on the last question, how much of that is things that either from which you get insight from Optum Health or from your own ability to look at prior year claims versus what you've seen so far is what you really think is going to happen and how much of that is sort of add-on just because of the moving parts out there? And then it sounds like you're basically saying that the care dynamics are similar, is there anything you call out outpatient, inpatient that suggest any variance relative to your MLR assumptions for the year when you started out?\nAndrew Witty: So I'm going to ask John just to comment on the $800 million more specifically. I mean, I think as we said a couple of times, A.J., really not seeing anything stand out in terms of care pattern differentiation from what we really expected. I mean, as we mentioned earlier, that kind of pressure we saw at the end of Q4 and rolling into the very beginning of the year around some kind of winter syndrome vaccination dynamics, we talked about a lot last time. As expected that did subside. Beyond that, I would -- which was what we were anticipating. Beyond that, I wouldn't say there's anything really to call out within all of that. John, could you maybe go a little deeper on the $800 million?\nJohn Rex: Yeah, good morning, A.J. Yeah, so picking up on comment Andrew had made earlier, so what you're really doing there is estimating what you didn't see. So claims receipts that you may have not received in the quarter and trying to make an accommodation for that, as you said, a prudent accommodation for that. Just to acknowledge, that there clearly had to be some disruption in the quarter in claims patterns and so you're trying to make some estimation in that zone to anticipate that. So you need to put it somewhere in the zone, it's not zero and it's not 800, somewhere in between, probably as you think about those elements and where you might -- where you might land and so as we look out. And you should expect that we'll probably continue with a judicious view over this, over the next several quarters actually also. We want to make sure that we've got full visibility into this that the claims are flowing and as we sit here on April 16th, it does. We see at UHC. We see a fairly normal claims receipts and payments flows going on at this point, but we really want to be careful on that because we know there are certain care providers out there that may have been left out a bit, and so we'll continue to be very judicious next quarter also in terms of assessing that.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. Thank you, A.J. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. First, I just wanted to quickly follow-up on A.J.'s question here around $800 million. Can you just be specific around, is that conservatism related to 2023, meaning you would have had up to $800 million of development that would have benefited the quarter or are you saying that you just took extra reserves that actually impacted Q1? Because we're looking at an MLR that's 50 basis points above where you kind of expected it and if you're saying trend is in line, so we're trying to figure out, was there a 50 basis point miss or are you saying that really that's just the conservatism here. And then any -- my question was really around the relative visibility on cost trend, right? Last year, it was somewhat opaque. You kind of told us that there was some uncertainty and then if that uncertainty turned to certainty around, hey, trend is higher in Q2. How do you feel about your visibility this year? Do we have to wait till 2Q to kind of be able to declare that, hey, we're kind of through this and you're not seeing what the rest of the industry is seeing or do you do you think we probably have to get that updated again in second quarter? And lastly, any commentary on Q2 MLR and where you think you end up in the full year range for MLR would certainly be helpful if you could provide? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Okay, Justin. Thanks for those questions. Let me -- I'm going to ask John in a second just to go back and again just give you a little bit more definition around the $800 million as you asked. Just in terms of -- and just in terms of cost trend and let me make a couple of comments and ask Brian maybe to go a little deeper as well and then come back to John. As I look at the cost trend this year versus last year, some big differences. So last year, really I think the core of the story of what led to that sort of step shift, if I can put it that way, in early Q2 -- Q2 of last year. I think that was really -- and the hindsight tells us that was really around a kind of post-COVID or end of COVID story playing out in terms of capacity coming on stream most importantly and to some degree of pent-up demand. I actually think the capacity coming on stream was as much an issue driver of that as anything else. So I think to some degree a one-off. We don't see anything like that. We've seen much more stabilization. We haven't seen a step down from that trend. We'd be super clear about that. We haven't seen it kind of go back down again, but we've certainly seen that kind of sustained activity without aggressive acceleration. And then the other thing, I would say to you is, as you would expect, given that shift we saw last year in the intervening year, we've put in a lot of sensing mechanisms across our organization, both in UAC and Optum, to look for early warning signals of changes, quite a low granularity in terms of trying to figure out how this pattern plays out. Now as all our actuaries and any actual will tell you that the gold standard of knowledge on trend is a paid claim, but nonetheless, we've tried to put in place a lot more prospective sensing capability. And again, that's kind of consistent with what we're sharing with you. So we're not really anticipating a big change there. I mean, obviously, the future is the future, but as we sit today, everything looks pretty much as expected. Brian, you may want to give a bit more from a UHC perspective.\nBrian Thompson: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. And I think you summarized it well. I'll reiterate what you heard from John, which is what we're seeing in these underlying service types, inpatient, outpatient, et cetera, are in line with what we had planned for, so I'll reiterate that. Just to add to that level of improved visibility this year over last, certainly COVID being the biggest driver, but also re-determinations. Last year, we were at the beginning of that. This year, we're nearing the end of that. So two key unknowns a year ago I think that contributed to perhaps a little less visibility, both of which I think we've really got a better view to this year. And the last thing I'll just point out is, as we've paced through one-one, I also feel good about our business mix. Again, early in the stages of evaluation of that, but how our growth has changed and what we've seen in those profiles from the growth that you're seeing in our Commercial business to the growth in our Medicare business as well, really feel good about all those elements. So, yes, optimistic about the rest of the year and how it's playing out against what we had planned for.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks, Brian. And John?\nJohn Rex: Yeah, Justin, good morning. So I think the way you look at it, so overall the net view being, so we didn't let any earnings or medical care ratio impacting development flow-through into the quarter. And when you look at it, so you can come at it, as to the normative course of assessments would have indicated some potential for favorable development in the quarter. We would -- we took a position also that there was likelihood that there were claims we didn't receive. And so in terms of the claims completion factors and such and so how that may have impacted and so you're really netting that all off in the course of the quarter to try to just normalize that out, not having any impact from any of those -- from those elements, and taking a pretty prudent view of where you might be in terms of the claims you received. In terms of your question here on the Q2 MCR, at this distance, I put it in a similar zip code to 1Q, including similar impact from the cyber effects that we had also, and as I noted in response to A.J.'s question, we'll be continued to be very judicious as we look at those patterns also on claims receipts. So we'll continue with the judicious view of how we think about -- how we think about development and those impacts as we step out here in the next couple of quarters to make sure we're getting our claims receipt timings fully incurred here.\nAndrew Witty: Great. John, thanks so much. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Yeah, hi, thanks. The business disruption costs you've projected beyond the first quarter are, I think, smaller maybe than most had expected despite the fact we've heard commentary from stakeholders reducing their dependence on Change Healthcare during the quarter. I guess, what are you seeing from customers on that front? I guess, how much of that recovery do you have on the revenue line? Do you have line-of-sight to versus you have to drive throughout the balance of the year to get to that no impact to 2025 that you seem to expect? Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, Stephen, thanks so much. So I'm going to ask Roger Connor, who runs Optum Insight to give you a little detail on this. First off, so I just want to -- I just want to take a moment to pay credit to the teams for the speed in which they brought back the overwhelming majority, the functionality of Optum -- of Change Healthcare after the attack. It's been extraordinary example of really the resources of UHG, and frankly, the support of many of the biggest companies across America in the tech environment coming in to help recover from this particular attack, which was straight out an attack on the US Health System, and designed to create maximum damage I think. We've got through that very well in terms of the remediation and the build back to functionality, and Roger, maybe you could share a little bit of what you're seeing and expect in terms of customer dynamics over the next few months.\nRoger Connor: Yeah, we'll do. Stephen, thanks very much for the question. So the way that we're thinking about the whole cyberattack response is two key areas of focus. First of all, as Andrew mentioned, good progress on system restoration. If you look at the biggest areas where we have the largest number of customers, that's pharmacy, claim, and payment, we're up to 80% functionality and that's continuing to improve day-by-day. Now we've still got work to do. We've got another set of products coming online in the number in the coming weeks, but pleased with that progress. I think your question is really about our next focus, which is recovering the business and this is about bringing those products back, but actually bringing them back stronger where we can. We're adding functionality where we can too. But then also bringing back customers, who because of the outage have to go elsewhere to get things like their clearance house support. Now we are confident in our ability to do that. Why? Well, first of all, the portfolio and the differentiation we have, which is good. But also, as you can imagine, we're talking to those customers all the time and they want their functionality back. They like what they've got or they had with Change and they want to get that back. So we're working with them to ensure that we can actually do that. Also, we provided financial support to a number of our clients and they appreciate that. They have said to us that they appreciate it. That's a signal that we are committed both to them, but then also to this marketplace as well. So when you add those elements up, Stephen, that's where we're confident. We've got more work to do. This has been a heavy lift and we're going to continue that work. But that's why we're confident in getting back to that baseline performance in 2025.\nAndrew Witty: Roger, thanks so much. And I think, Stephen, what you heard in Roger's response there is a couple of really important features of the character of UnitedHealth Group, super high resilience and we will always stand by our customers and clients, and when an attack like this happens, which puts our customers and clients at risk, we will do whatever it takes to make sure they get through that, whether it's technical fixes or financial support, we are going to stand by our clients, who in this case are the providers and the systems across America who look after American patients and we will do that. And I think that means a lot to a lot of people and it's an important capability to have running through the backbone of American healthcare. With that, Stephen, thanks for the question. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Just want to go more -- a little bit more into the visibility that you guys think that you have into claims today. It sounds like you feel like you're largely back, but I guess, where would you say today that you are from a percent visibility into claims versus the same time last year? And I know that there's forecasted improvement, but I think there's a lot of focus on the ability to price 2025 correctly. So by the time you're submitting your MA bids, how much back to normal? What percentage back to normal do you think you'll be from a claims perspective at that point? And then finally, I'm used to hearing you guys reiterate 13% to 16% long term EPS growth, but I didn't hear that in the prepared remarks. I just wasn't sure if that was due to time or whether there was anything that you were trying to say there. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: All right. So I'm going to ask John to comment on your substantive question, Kevin, and I'm going to ask you just to stay on the line for my last paragraph for closing comments for the second part of your question. John?\nJohn Rex: Good morning, Kevin. So as we sit here today on April 16th, I would say, UHC is pretty much back to normal levels in terms of claim submission activity. We view it as normalized now. That we're seeing claims slowing like they -- we'd expect them to be flowing and moving along. So that's all progressing quite well, which assists a lot with the piece that you were just describing here in terms of where we think that is and as we move forward and look over the next month plus to finalize our bid submissions and such. So feel good about that in terms of our visibility and insights.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah. Thanks so much, John, and thanks so much, Kevin. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the reported DOJ investigation. I'd be curious, has the company had kind of dialogue with the DOJ and do you have a sense of timeline for what the next steps might be as we look about what -- for what the possible outcome of this process could be?\nAndrew Witty: Hey, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. Listen, I think you'd probably expect we don't comment on these sorts of matters and I don't think it would be appropriate to do so today, and certainly, we never have done in the past. So it's not something we're going to get into in the call, but I appreciate the interest. Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Mok with Barclays.\nAndrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. Commercial risk and ASO membership both came in above the high end of your initial guidance, can you help us understand what drove the membership -- a better membership results for each segment? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much for the question. I'll ask Dan Kueter, who runs our E&I business from UHC to respond to that. Dan?\nDan Kueter: Yeah. Hi, Andrew, and thanks for the question. Certainly encouraged with the broad based growth, share gaining growth, I would say, in our Individual segment, our Local Market segment, and our National Accounts business. Some of the key drivers underlying that, about a third of our Group growth gains were attached to our most innovative products and the expansion of those into 37 states now, on a fully-insured basis, to be -- and also fully available nationally on an ASO fee-based business. Specifically inside the risk business, our individual and family exchange-based plans were a significant driver of the growth. We've seen some latency. From membership, we expected that would have come in from re-determinations into the final portions of 2023, now begin to emerge into 2024. That's been a significant contributor to that risk-based growth in the first quarter. As a punchline, I like our growth, I like the pricing, very much like the profile of both the groups and the consumers that we're attracting. And finally, I'm really pleased with the consumer experience that our teams are delivering to those that we serve. Thanks for the question.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much. And as you saw, Dan's organization delivered an extraordinary two million member growth in the first quarter, one of the highest growth rates we've seen for many, many years. And I think that really comes down to relentless focus on modernization of service offer and then delivery of that service offer, and I'm very proud of the whole team in the UHC Commercial businesses domestically for what they've done. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks. Question on Optum Health. As we're looking at outlook there, we've been really focused on capacity growth in the systems, do you guys have any insights for your capacity growth in Optum Health? Obviously, you've been taking some cost actions there, so interested in hiring trends. And then second, have you been renegotiating risk deals? I know that there was likely some of that for '24. What's the outlook for that and the impact of that in '24 and the outlook of that for '25? Thanks a lot.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, Lance, thanks so much. And I'm glad you've asked about Optum Health. I'm going to ask Dr. Desai to respond to that. Amar runs our Optum Health business. He has been doing a great job of continuing to mature that business for us, which for me, I think is one of the great headlines of Optum Health. Its continuous maturation as a sophisticated value-based care delivery organization, and Amar, maybe you could respond to Lance's question.\nAmar Desai: Yeah, thanks for the question, Lance. I'll take the first one in terms of hiring trends. We continue to work with more providers in a deeper way continuing to grow across a range of arrangements. As you know, physicians across the country work with us in contracted affiliated arrangements as well as employed arrangements and we continue to have strong partnership and growth, both organically and also through some of our inorganic M&A activity. We don't see a capacity constraint there. In fact, we've continued to see incredible growth with our payer partners to the second part of your question. The risk partner growth continues to increase across multiple payers. It's being driven by some of the funding and benefit dynamics that are out there. Folks are looking for a real stable partner to be able to grow with. We have worked with them continuously in terms of our contracts, both looking at the benefit and funding changes and ensuring that the funding level is appropriate for the risk that we're taking on, and to be able to provide very high quality care across our membership. So we're very proud of the growth we've had and we'll continue to do so. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Amar, thanks so much. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nSarah James: Thank you. We wanted to understand a little bit better the $3 billion in IBNR. So just our back-of-the-envelope math suggests if 15% to 20% of claims from UHC run-through change, post-event that would be like assuming a third of the change-related claims are delayed, is that in the ballpark of where your change completion factor assumptions were? And keeping that conservative assumption of a claims like throughout the year, what does that imply for the seasonality of the remaining $0.41 to $0.61 GAAP impact from change?\nAndrew Witty: Sarah James, thanks so much. John?\nJohn Rex: Yeah. So I don't know if I'd kind of go right with some of those stats that you pulled out in terms of where those fell, but here's some insights I can offer on that. So, one of the elements we wanted to break out on the IBNR component is, so, as you know, what we report on the balance sheet you received this morning, medical costs payable is a combination of IBNR and medical claims payable. And so we're hoping to provide some more transparency for you as you looked at the quarter and such, and a $3 billion increase in IBNR is significant. And then offsetting that on the -- on that line item would have been the -- really the funding advances. The component where we just made sure that as soon as the claim was in-house processed, we were speeding it out-the-door to get it to providers. That was one of the components in addition to the interest-free loans we made that we were helping the provider community -- the provider community with. As you talked -- as you discussed kind of where we were, let's say, today, we feel that UnitedHealthcare is essentially at normalized levels in terms of -- in terms of claims receipts. As we sit here, we're going to be super prudent in how we look at that because we know there are providers out there that could still be having trouble submitting claims, and still having troubles with payment flows and such, and so we're going to be very appropriately constrained in how we think about that dynamic playing out here over the next -- over the next couple of quarters. But really, those are the kind of mechanics of what's going on between the IBNR component that you spotlighted and the full line of medical costs payable.\nAndrew Witty: Right. Thanks, John. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on that point, John. My understanding is, on the IBNR that you report in your Qs and Ks includes unprocessed claims, inventories, so the $3 billion, is that just going to tie to the number we see when the Q comes out? Are you saying the $3 billion really is true unreported claims at this point?\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much, Gary. John?\nJohn Rex: $3 billion is IBNR directly, that is to your point. That is the IBNR component of it, Gary.\nAndrew Witty: Okay. Thanks, John. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Okay, thanks. On capital deployment, you didn't change your expectations for share repurchases, but how should we think about the priorities more broadly, whether it's M&A or otherwise in your ability to be opportunistic on that front? Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Erin, thanks so much. I'll ask John to comment on it.\nJohn Rex: Yeah, Erin. Yeah, we didn't update any of those components here. We continue to take a very balanced view in terms of how we think about our opportunities. You saw, certainly, that we had activity in the quarter from -- in terms of both share repurchase and dividends. Also, we continue with robust opportunities in the marketplace in terms of other capabilities that we are looking at. So that all continues strong. So you'll see us continue to balance those out nicely in terms of -- in terms of the opportunities that are out there and with capacities really to approach all those elements strongly.\nAndrew Witty: Yeah, and I continue to see very interesting diverse pipeline of M&A opportunity across the marketplace in terms of business areas that we have interest in. As I think you see some of the funding changes play out across the -- across the next few years, I suspect that may also create new opportunities for us as different companies assess their positions. I think how we look at this situation is we have a good strong strategy for how we navigate through this dynamic. You're seeing that play out super well in the first quarter performance of Optum Health and UHC and I think it gives us a sense of real confidence as we look not just in terms of our performance, but potentially how we might think about M&A opportunity. And as you rightly said, be somewhat opportunistic if those moments arrive. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.\nWhit Mayo: Thanks. Good morning. Just back on the 2025 rate notice, I think you're -- if I'm hearing you correctly, it sounds like you're framing this as modestly disappointing, but perhaps manageable. Just any more color on growth expectations for next year? And then if you could elaborate on the broker agent changes, what this could potentially mean for your strategy seems like a meaningful change. Don't know, if you think about investing more into captive broker strategies, just any color would be helpful. Thanks.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously, we're not going to get into give kind of '25 numbers or expectation just yet, but Tim Noel, who runs our M&R business, certainly give you some good perspective on the rest of your question. Tim?\nTim Noel: Yeah, good morning, Whit. Thanks for the question. So on the final notice and some of the distribution elements of that, we continue to believe that there's opportunities to improve the distribution environment in Medicare Advantage and have been in a dialog with CMS for several years on how to do that. Some of the elements of the final notice that were published recently are directly in line with some of our recommendations and some of them are relatively consistent, but not totally as we had conceived them. I would also say right now, it's a little bit early to comment on how this might rebalance some of the channel mix, as still some questions on how some of the key elements of that will be rolled out. So we're still waiting for a little bit more detail before we can get more specific on how it impacts go-to-market in '25.\nWhit Mayo: Great. Thanks so much, Tim. Next question.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.\nAnn Hynes: Hi. Good morning. So, I would say your commentary on care patterns is definitely more positive than what investors feared. And you referenced several times that trend came in line with your expectations, can you actually tell us what growth rates you're assuming like the major trend categories in guidance, whether that's inpatient and outpatient, and maybe some year-over-year growth versus historical averages? And within that, can you specifically talk about what you're assuming for MA? That'd be great. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: John, would you like to start that?\nJohn Rex: Yeah. Ann, good morning. So the components that I would call outliers are the similar components that we've talked about for a while here in terms of trend outlooks. So in particular, still go back to outpatient care for senior, what we've seen in orthopedic, cardiac, those kind of categories primarily have been the big factors. I think you brought up a really important point though. So the percentage growth in those was much bigger last year. You're coming off an environment where both the supply side had been constrained and the willingness of seniors, in particular, consumers to access that environment had been constrained for a couple of years. So those percentage factors were quite significant. You heard us talk about very significant levels on those double-digit levels of last year as we looked at those. The way we look at those really though is because you would expect that to start normalizing in terms of the percentage change. So you really look at that in terms of the number of units consumed per patient served. And so you look at those levels, that's what we're talking about and we're seeing those kind of continuing at those levels. They're continuing at those levels in terms of the number of units consumed, delivered, and -- but those percentage levels, of course, would start normalizing out a little bit in terms of what you'd seen. So that continues to be the area. It's outpatient care for seniors. It's those categories that we'd call real outlier areas versus our historical levels of trend factors. The other -- the other historical levels of trend factors remain much closer to kind of our traditional views that we've always had as a company. In the quarter, other things you look at just to get indications, and by the way, we kind of vastly expanded all those areas. First fills, you've heard us talk about that a lot. Also, first fills in the quarter, an indication of outpatient care, physician visit activity, it's kind of normalized in there also in terms of stabilizing for us and many -- the many other factors of the company historically looked at. Thank you.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, John. And maybe ask Brian maybe to give you a little bit more from a UHC perspective, and then maybe Heather also from a Optum perspective in a second, just maybe reflect a little bit on the work you're doing in terms of how we -- obviously, medical trend is one thing, then there's a question of how well we're able to engage with folks to actually help them manage their cost and maybe come to you in a second, Heather, on some of the word that you're leading at Optum. So Brian, first?\nBrian Thompson: Sure. I think John said it well. The first headline is what we're seeing is what we plan for. But as he alluded to, some of those elements, we plan for them to be elevated year-over-year. And I don't want to lose sight of unit costs. We've talked for some time that multi-year provider group and hospital contracts renew a little later than perhaps the inflation we've seen and that is up year-over-year. The biggest driver was the outpatient. We're really pleased to see that in line with as John explained. But also, we've been able to see increases in Specialty Rx. We've planned for those. Those are in our pricing appropriately, et cetera. And we've certainly worked hard to create more access in the behavioral space. So all of those elements are modestly up, but up as we had planned for and they'll hopefully sound familiar to you because we spoke to all of these at our investor conference as we ended the year. So I think that's what I would summarize or add to John's commentary. Heather?\nHeather Cianfrocco: So, I would say, incredibly consistent on the Optum side. So maybe just focusing on the medical first. So I mean, I think you've heard us say this, when you look, when we came out of last year, looking into this year, our focus was on the behavioral health, those outpatient sides consistent with UnitedHealthcare. And what was very important for Optum Health was using that capacity that Amar explained in our physicians, as well as those wrap-around services and our investments to ensure that we were looking at those care patterns. So, we feel really good about coming into this year. That work we've done, John referenced engagement with particularly those most complex numbers, 75% already engaged. And that PCP engagement, that member engagement is incredibly important, whether it's with their PCP directly or it's with some of our care -- our own care management wrap-around services. Because it identifies affordability opportunities incredibly quickly. It also identifies chronic disease that needs to be managed and it gets them connected to primary care quickly. So that's our focus for the year and that's why we feel good about that our ability to control utilization on the medical side particularly. And again, what we'll remind you is a reduced funding environment as we go into this year. So that's what brings us -- that's what brings that value-based care proposition, incredible value to all of our payers. On the pharmacy side, I call it, same things. For our clients, that specialty trend is a focus and we bring those products and solutions and that's why we've seen growth on the PBM side and our pharmacies around our clinical model and the continued innovative products that we're bringing to bear. So you're seeing that pull-through in the diversified growth and strength of the performance on the Optum Rx side as well.\nAndrew Witty: Great. Thanks so much, Heather. Just one number Heather just shared with you there, which I'm very pleased of and it's a significant improvement year-over-year is that 75% engagement of the most complex members in Optum Health. And just for that, that means three out of every four most complex, most disadvantaged folks in the country have had a direct engagement with us in the first three months of the year. That's a great rate of touch. Opens the door then for us really getting to know those folks, helping the system, helping bring the system to support that many of these people, particularly those who are trapped in their homes have just not had access to that kind of care opportunity. That engagement is the first step of doing that. We have -- we really believe that is a key to how we not only deliver an effective care delivery from a cost point of view, but also make sure they get the very best quality that they deserve. So really pleased to see that step up year-over-year. I think we have time for one last question. If we could take that question, please, Jennifer.\nOperator: Yes, we'll go to our last question from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.\nJessica Tassan: [Technical Difficulty] A few more details maybe on the --\nAndrew Witty: Sorry, we missed the beginning of your question.\nJessica Tassan: Hi. Sorry about that. I'm interested in a few more details maybe around the launch of Change 2.0. If you could talk a little about what payer receptivity to reconnection has been? Whether Change retains its legacy data rights post breach? And then just any change or updated thoughts on kind of the long-term thesis on Change for something like a real-time transparent payments and decision support network? Thanks so much.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks very much for the question. Let me ask Roger to kick that one off.\nRoger Connor: Yeah, Jessica, thanks very much for the question. First of all, on your first part about Change 2.0. Again, we're just confident in terms of our ability to reconnect. I mentioned the level of functional restoration that we have. You can imagine now the next stage of this is working with payer and provider to reconnect them in a safe way and an appropriate way, and all of the conversations that we're having with them are positive as we work through it. As I mentioned, there's still work to do and that's going to take us a little bit of time, but we're continuing to work through that functionality. I think it's important also to recognize, where Change sits in the overall Optum Insight portfolio. Change Healthcare was about 15% of our projected revenue for this year and when you look at -- that means I've got thousands of people who are continuing to work on other products outside of Change, not impacted by this and their underlying performance this quarter has been strong. If you adjust for the Change out, that business' earnings actually grew by around 10%. But what we haven't slowed either, as you mentioned, is our innovation agenda. The excitement of the Change portfolio across the Optum Insight portfolio is what we can bring to this market to transform it from an innovation point-of-view. And the real-time settlement work that we're doing, plus work that we've been doing with Optum Health on value-based care and provider risk enablement, that's all still going ahead. So in terms of our innovation agenda and the performance of the underlying business within Optum Insight, we're very positive.\nAndrew Witty: Roger, thanks so much. And yeah, absolutely, Change Healthcare, the important acquisition for the group and I think important for the country that we own Change Healthcare. Without UnitedHealth Group owning Change Healthcare, this attack would likely still have happened and it would have -- it would have left Change Healthcare, I think, extremely challenged to come back because it was a part of UnitedHealth Group, we've been able to bring it back. We're going to bring it back much stronger than it was before. And secondarily, all of the reasons that we were interested in bringing the Change Healthcare capabilities and customer connectivity closer to UnitedHealth Group still absolutely holds fast in terms of the potential innovation around things like real-time settlement, clinical decision support capabilities, all of those products are the future services of the future, which ought to be characteristics of a modern healthcare environment. Those are all the reasons why we believe Change and Health -- and UHG were better together. This cyberattack has unfortunately created another true validation of why that was the right thing to do because it meant UHG was in position to resolve this much more quickly than I think would ever have been imaginable in a standalone situation.\nAndrew Witty: Thanks, everybody, for all of your questions this morning. It's been a bit more of a complex quarter for sure this time around, but one that's also showed the depth and breadth of our company's capabilities. We're recovering quickly from the Change Healthcare attack and are a stronger, more capable company as a result. We're continuing to build our business based on the five strategic growth pillars that we're relentlessly focused on, and we're steadfastly confident in our ability to achieve our 13% to 16% long-term growth objective as we look to the years ahead. We very much appreciate all of your time and attention this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."}]}
