Nike's earnings call highlights a robust performance with a 9% increase in brand revenues and record diluted EPS, indicating strong consumer demand and effective strategy execution. However, rising input costs, particularly materials and airfreight, are expected to pressure gross margins, a trend likely to persist into FY '12. While the company plans strategic price increases, the impact will primarily manifest in the second half of the fiscal year. Overall, the robust consumer demand and implementation of pricing strategies may offset some margin pressures, suggesting a cautiously optimistic short-term outlook.
