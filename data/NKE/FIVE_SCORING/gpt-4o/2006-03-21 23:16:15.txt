Nike's fiscal 2006 third-quarter results show strong performances across various regions and product lines, with particular strength in the United States and emerging markets like China and Brazil. The company managed to offset gross margin pressures through SG&A leverage, driving record revenues and profit. Despite challenges in Europe and Japan, Nike's robust product pipeline and strategic investments point to sustained growth. Management's optimistic outlook and the successful launch of key products like the Air Max 360 suggest positive momentum, potentially boosting investor confidence in the short term.
