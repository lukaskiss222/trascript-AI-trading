Nikeâ€™s Q1 2025 earnings call presented a mixed outlook. The transition of leadership with a new CEO and withdrawal of full-year guidance introduces uncertainty. Although there was progress in the running category and initiatives to reinvigorate brand momentum, traffic declines and inventory issues, particularly in Digital and Greater China, pose near-term challenges. The company is actively managing its classic footwear franchises' rebalancing, which may continue to pressure revenues, and the focus on promotional activity might affect margin expansion efforts. Overall, the immediate impact is likely to be negative due to leadership transition and ongoing operational challenges.
