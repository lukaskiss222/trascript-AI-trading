Nikeâ€™s earnings call for the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter highlights strong performance with a 9% increase in revenue and an 18% growth in earnings per share. The company reported robust expansion in international markets like China, which doubled sales over two years, and emphasized successful initiatives such as Joga Bonito and Nike Plus. Although gross margins faced pressure due to cost increases, Nike is managing expenses effectively and planning a significant four-year share repurchase program. The combination of revenue growth, strong international sales, strategic brand initiatives, and shareholder-friendly actions suggests a positive short-term outlook for Nike's stock.
