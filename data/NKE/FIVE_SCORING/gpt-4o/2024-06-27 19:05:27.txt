Nike's earnings call for fiscal 2024 Q4 highlights several short-term challenges, including a decline in their lifestyle business and a weaker than expected digital performance, influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties and foreign exchange headwinds. The company revised its fiscal 2025 outlook downwards, predicting a mid-single-digit decline in revenue, emphasizing greater challenges in the first half of the year. Despite these setbacks, Nike is aggressively managing its classic footwear franchises and rolling out new product innovations, maintaining long-term confidence. The immediate focus on rebalancing its portfolio and the anticipated headwinds suggest a negative short-term impact on the stock.
