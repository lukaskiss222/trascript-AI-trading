Nike's earnings call for Q2 of Fiscal 2013 indicated strong performance, with revenues up 7% (10% excluding currency impacts), driven by innovation in product offerings and effective digital strategies. The company sees potential for growth in North America and China, and digital innovations like Flyknit are expected to continue driving consumer engagement and sales. However, challenges in China with high inventory levels and market volatility are noted, but the management expresses confidence in handling these issues. Overall, the positive growth, robust consumer engagement strategies, and digital investments are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on Nike's stock.
