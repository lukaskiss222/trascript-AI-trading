Nike's fiscal 2009 Q1 earnings call highlights robust brand strength and solid financial performance, with 17% revenue growth and improved gross margins despite a tough economic climate. The company's strategic focus on innovation, category-based consumer connection, and global expansion, notably in China, underpins continued market share gains and positive futures orders, signaling strong ongoing momentum. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, Nike's effective cost management, successful retail partnerships, and a new $5 billion share repurchase program should lend positive sentiment to the stock in the near term.
