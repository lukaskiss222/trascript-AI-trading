NIKE's Q1 2013 earnings call highlights the company's robust performance with 10% revenue growth and strong brand engagement despite macroeconomic challenges. The management demonstrates confidence in its ability to leverage innovation and brand power, particularly with success in key events like the Olympics and European Championships. However, there are concerns with China's market volatility and excess inventory, which could dampen short-term performance. Overall, these factors suggest a relatively stable short-term outlook for the stock with balanced risks and growth potential.
