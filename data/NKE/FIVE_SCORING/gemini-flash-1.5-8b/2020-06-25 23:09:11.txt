Nike's earnings call highlights significant digital growth, driven by consumer demand shifts during the pandemic.  Management emphasizes a strategic acceleration of the Consumer Direct strategy, focusing on digital and a simplified consumer construct (men's, women's, kids). While Q4 showed a 38% revenue decline,  strong  digital performance and positive trends in markets like Greater China suggest potential for future growth. Short-term stock impact hinges on the success of the Consumer Direct acceleration and management's ability to effectively manage inventory levels and costs.
