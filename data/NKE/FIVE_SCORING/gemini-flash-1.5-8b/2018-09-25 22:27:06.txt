Nike's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted strong growth, driven by digital initiatives (SNKRS app, Nike Live stores) and innovative product launches (VaporMax, React).  Management projects continued momentum, with a focus on expanding their DTC channels and further integrating digital into physical retail.  Short-term, the stock may see positive movement on the strength of the new product launches and positive guidance, although there's a slight caveat given the potential impact of currency fluctuations.
