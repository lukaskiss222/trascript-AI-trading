NIKE's Q3 earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, with revenue growth exceeding expectations and positive guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2016.  Management emphasized their "complete offense" strategy, showcasing innovation in various product lines and digital initiatives like the Nike+ app. While there are supply-chain-related inventory issues in North America,  the company expects to manage these through factory stores and selective third-party channels, maintaining positive momentum for the short term.  The call suggests a likely continuation of positive short-term stock performance related to strong revenue, new innovations, and the strong consumer demand, along with the ongoing positive outlook for long-term growth.
