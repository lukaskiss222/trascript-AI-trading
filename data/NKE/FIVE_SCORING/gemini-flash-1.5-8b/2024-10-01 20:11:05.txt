NIKE's earnings call indicates short-term stock pressure.  While management emphasized strong performance in new products and sports categories, notably running, the company's withdrawal of guidance, coupled with lower-than-expected unit sales, particularly in Greater China and digital channels, suggests a more cautious outlook for the next few weeks.  The management transition and focus on rebalancing the portfolio towards newer products will likely lead to near-term negative sentiment.
