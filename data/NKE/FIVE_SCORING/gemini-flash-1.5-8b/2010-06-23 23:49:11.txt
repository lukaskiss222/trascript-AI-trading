Nike's earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, with record profitability and increased cash flow.  Management emphasized the company's momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010, particularly in key markets and categories like football and apparel.  Guidance for fiscal 2011 anticipates continued growth, albeit with pressure from currency headwinds and rising input costs, suggesting slightly lower gross margins and a need for continued operational efficiency.  This suggests the stock could face some short-term pressure from these factors, but the overall positive outlook and strong execution likely prevents a significant drop in the next 1-2 weeks.
