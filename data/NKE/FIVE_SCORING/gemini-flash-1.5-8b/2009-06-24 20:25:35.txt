Nike's earnings call highlights a cautious outlook for fiscal 2010, projecting flat to slightly down revenues on a constant-currency basis.  While management emphasizes strong brand performance and share gains in some segments, particularly in certain regions and categories like Converse and basketball, they acknowledge headwinds from currency fluctuations and the broader economic uncertainty.  The company is focused on maintaining brand integrity, managing inventory prudently, and positioning itself for a future recovery.  The stock might see modest negative pressure in the near term due to the cautious guidance and ongoing economic uncertainty but could rally on improving long-term performance.
