NIKE's earnings transcript indicates strong short-term positive momentum.  The company achieved high double-digit digital growth, exceeding targets, and detailed plans for continued investment in digital infrastructure and product launches.  Management's confidence in long-term growth and consumer demand, coupled with a cautious but optimistic outlook for the second half, suggests a likely positive stock price reaction, possibly a rally over the next few weeks.
