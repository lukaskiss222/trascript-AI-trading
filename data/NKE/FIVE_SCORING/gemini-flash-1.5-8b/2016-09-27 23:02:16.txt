NIKE's earnings call highlights strong revenue growth (10% currency-neutral) fueled by strong performance in all international regions, particularly China.  Management's upbeat tone, emphasis on innovation (e.g., HyperAdapt, LunarEpic), and strategic partnerships (Apple Watch Nike+) suggest a positive outlook.  However, tighter inventory management in some regions (likely North America) and a slight margin contraction may temper immediate stock price gains.
