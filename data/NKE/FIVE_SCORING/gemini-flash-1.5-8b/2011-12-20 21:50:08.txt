NIKE's Q2 2012 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth (18% on a reported basis) driven by innovation, brand strength, and strong performance in key categories like Running and Basketball.  Management emphasized continued focus on their "category offense" strategy and the importance of digital and direct-to-consumer channels.  However, margins came under pressure due to continued input cost inflation and FX headwinds.  Stock likely to experience short-term positive sentiment due to strong top-line growth, but cautious investors may still be concerned about margin compression and the need for sustained growth.
