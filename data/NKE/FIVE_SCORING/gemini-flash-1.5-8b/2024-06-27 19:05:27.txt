Nike's earnings call highlights a transition year in 2025, characterized by aggressive actions to manage existing product lines, while simultaneously investing heavily in new product development.  While the company sees positive signs in Performance segments and new product launches like Pegasus 41, the near-term outlook is negatively impacted by reduced guidance due to declines in lifestyle, digital sales, and some market headwinds. This suggests potential short-term stock price pressure.
