Nike's Q2 earnings call highlighted strong performance, driven by innovation and a well-diversified portfolio.  Management emphasized continued investment in digital, category offense, and strong execution in key markets like North America.  The company's focus on China, while showing some challenges in the near-term, is viewed as a long-term opportunity.  The stock price should remain positive in the next 1-2 weeks based on these positive signals.
