Nike's Q3 earnings call highlights significant positive momentum, driven by strong performance across categories and geographies, especially in apparel and direct-to-consumer channels.  Management's confident tone and updated guidance, projecting mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth in Q4 with improved gross margins, suggest continued positive trends.  The company's focus on leaner product lines, improving retail operations, and leveraging key sporting events like the upcoming World Cup point toward a likely rally in the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
