Nike's earnings call highlights strong performance, particularly in the US and emerging markets, but acknowledges headwinds in Western Europe and Japan.  Management is pleased with recent product launches, especially the Air Max 360, and emphasizes ongoing efforts to improve supply chain efficiency and SG&A leverage to offset margin pressure. While a little muted, forward orders are deemed satisfactory.  The short-term outlook suggests continued strength, tempered by challenges in specific geographies, but the company remains confident in its long-term growth trajectory.
