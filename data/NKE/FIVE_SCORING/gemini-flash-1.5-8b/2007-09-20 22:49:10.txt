Nike's Q1 earnings call indicates strong international growth, particularly in Asia, offsetting some weakness in the U.S.  Management's focus on category-based strategies, premium consumer experiences, and investments in e-commerce suggests a long-term growth plan.  However, the tempered guidance suggests that the short-term impact, while positive overall, is likely to be driven primarily by international performance and may face headwinds from the US mall-based athletic specialty accounts.
