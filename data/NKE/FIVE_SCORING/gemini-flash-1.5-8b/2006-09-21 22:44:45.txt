Nike's Q1 earnings call highlights continued strong top-line growth across various product categories and regions, exceeding expectations in several areas. Positive commentary on the performance of the Nike brand, Hurley, and Converse, coupled with robust futures orders, points towards a positive outlook.  However, concerns linger regarding sequentially improving gross margins as macroeconomic headwinds (input costs, air freight, discounts, mix shift), particularly in Europe (U.K. & France), persist.  These concerns might temper the short-term optimism, with a potential slight stock correction.
