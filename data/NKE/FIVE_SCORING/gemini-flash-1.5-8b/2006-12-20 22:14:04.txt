Nike's Q2 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth across all regions and product lines, driven by strong performance in apparel, particularly performance apparel, and continued success of Converse. Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to maintain growth, emphasizing category-focused strategies and initiatives such as Nike Plus and new product launches (e.g., Air Force 25).  While inventory growth is still a concern, management believes it's manageable and won't significantly impact results.
