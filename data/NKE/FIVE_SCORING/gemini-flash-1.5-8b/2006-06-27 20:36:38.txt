Nike's earnings call highlights robust revenue growth, driven by strong performance in emerging markets like China and sustained momentum in the US.  Management expresses confidence in future growth strategies, particularly in sport culture, and initiatives like Nike Plus and Joga Bonito. However, concerns remain about inventory levels, particularly in Europe, and the potential impact of fluctuating exchange rates and input costs on gross margins. The guidance suggests that while the topline remains strong, margin pressure and stock buybacks will likely result in limited short-term EPS growth.
