NIKE's earnings call highlights strong Q2 performance, driven by double-digit growth across all geographies and categories, especially in China and Western Europe.  Management emphasizes continued innovation, strong brand partnerships, and the expanding digital platform (NIKE.com).  However, inventory levels remain elevated in North America, potentially limiting margins in the short term, though managers indicate plans to efficiently clear out excess inventory.  This mixed bag of positive results and short-term headwinds suggests a potentially volatile stock price in the next few weeks, with potential for minor negative impact due to margin pressure and uncertainty related to excess inventory.
