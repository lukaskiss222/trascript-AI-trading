NIKE's earnings call highlights strong international performance and a focus on innovation and digital strategies.  Management expressed confidence in achieving long-term growth targets, particularly in international markets, and pointed to robust product launches and growing direct sales as key drivers.  While North America showed some signs of weakness,  management believes the trend will reverse, particularly with the anticipated product releases slated for the second half of the financial year.  This suggests a likely positive impact on stock price in the next one to two weeks as investors will likely focus on the second-half guidance.
