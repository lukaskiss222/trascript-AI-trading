Nike's Q1 2012 earnings show strong revenue growth (18%) and EPS growth (19%) despite a slight dip in gross margins due to rising product costs.  Management's optimistic tone, particularly about the DTC investments' impact, and the focus on global opportunities in a volatile market, suggests support for the stock.  The detailed guidance for improved margins in the second half and notable product innovations indicate continued growth potential despite the challenging global economic backdrop.
