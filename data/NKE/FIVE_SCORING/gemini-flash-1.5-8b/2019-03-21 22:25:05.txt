Nike's Q3 earnings call highlighted strong performance across all segments, driven by robust innovation (e.g., Air Max models), digital growth (NIKE+ membership, SNKRS), and a successful "Consumer Direct Offense."  Management expressed confidence in the company's long-term growth trajectory despite some short-term headwinds and the continuing investment in their digital ecosystem, which should have a positive effect on the stock price over the next few weeks.
