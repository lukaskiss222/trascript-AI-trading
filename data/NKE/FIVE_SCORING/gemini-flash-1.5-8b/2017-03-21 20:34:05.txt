Nike's Q3 earnings call highlighted a strong performance, especially internationally, with revenue growth exceeding expectations.  Management emphasized a shift towards digital, and their "triple double" strategy focused on innovation, speed, and direct consumer engagement.  However, a more promotional environment in North America and FX headwinds could impact short-term profitability.  The stock's trajectory in the next few weeks will likely depend on the ability of Nike to effectively manage these short-term challenges while executing its long-term growth strategy.
