Nike's Q1 earnings call highlighted strong consumer demand despite supply chain disruptions.  Management noted significant increases in transit times and factory closures in Vietnam, impacting production and delivery.  While guidance was lowered, the call stressed long-term growth potential due to brand strength, consumer relationships accelerated by digital, and continued investment in innovation across products and services.  The stock price is likely to see some pressure due to uncertainty around supply chain recovery in both the near term and throughout the rest of the year.
