The earnings transcript for NIKE, Inc. reveals several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Revenue Growth**: NIKE reported strong revenue growth, with a 12% increase in the fourth quarter and a 16% increase for the full year, driven by product innovation, brand strength, and geographic expansion[3|.
2. **Gross Margin Challenges**: Despite strong revenue, gross margins were impacted by higher input costs, digital R&D investments, and an unanticipated customs assessment, leading to a 220 basis point decline for the year[3|.
3. **SG&A and Tax Rate**: SG&A grew faster than revenue in Q4, driven by demand creation investments, and the effective tax rate increased to 25.5%[3|.
4. **Inventory Management**: Inventory levels are higher than desired, particularly in China and Western Europe, but the company is making progress in managing these levels[3|.
5. **Guidance for FY 2013**: NIKE expects high single-digit revenue growth, but with gross margins declining about 100 basis points in Q1 due to FX headwinds, and a higher effective tax rate[3|.
6. **Strategic Focus**: The company is focusing on innovation, brand strength, and operational efficiency to drive long-term growth, including significant investments in digital technologies and product innovation like Flyknit and FuelBand[3!.

Given these points:

- The strong revenue growth and continued innovation are positive factors.
- However, the challenges in gross margins, higher SG&A, and inventory issues, particularly in China and Western Europe, are short-term headwinds.
- The guidance for FY 2013 indicates some near-term pressures due to FX and tax rate impacts.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the margin challenges and inventory issues, but the overall strong performance and long-term growth strategy suggest that this pressure may be temporary.
