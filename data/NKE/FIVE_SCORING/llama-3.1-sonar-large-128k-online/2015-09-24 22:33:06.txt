### Near-Term Challenges:
- **Inventory Management**: There are inventory elevation issues in North America due to West Coast port congestion, which is expected to impact gross margin in the near term as the company works to clear excess inventory by the end of Q3[5].
- **Foreign Exchange Headwinds**: Despite strong currency-neutral growth, reported revenue and futures orders were affected by a stronger U.S. dollar, which could continue to impact reported results[5].

Given these points, the overall positive momentum in revenue growth, innovation, and geographic expansion is likely to outweigh the near-term challenges related to inventory management and foreign exchange headwinds.
