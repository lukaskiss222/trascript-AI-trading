The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2011 third quarter conference call indicates several key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Revenue and EPS Growth**: NIKE Inc. reported a 7% increase in revenue and a 7% increase in diluted EPS, which are the strongest Q3 results in the company's history[4].
- **Consumer Demand and Brand Strength**: The company saw extraordinary consumer demand, particularly in North America and China, with strong growth in key categories like running, men's and women's training, and basketball[4].
- **Future Orders and Inventory**: Futures orders increased by 9% on a currency-neutral basis, and inventory levels, though up, are considered normalized and supportive of future growth[4].

### Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:
- **Gross Margin Pressure**: The company faced gross margin declines due to higher input costs and air freight expenses, but plans to mitigate these through price increases and supply chain efficiencies[4].
- **Input Costs and Air Freight**: Higher costs for materials, labor, and freight are expected to continue, but NIKE is leveraging its scale and operational capabilities to manage these costs[4].

### Guidance and Outlook:
- **Q4 and FY 2011 Guidance**: The company expects high single-digit revenue growth in Q4, but with gross margins at least 300 basis points below the previous year's record due to ongoing input cost inflation and air freight costs[4].
- **FY 2012 Outlook**: NIKE expects full-year revenue growth at or slightly above the high single-digit target, with pricing actions to offset some of the gross margin pressure, particularly in the second half of the year[4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong Q3 performance, robust consumer demand, and the company's proactive strategies to manage cost pressures. However, the immediate gross margin pressure and ongoing input costs might temper some of the enthusiasm.
