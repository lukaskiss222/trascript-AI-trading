Nike's fiscal 2009 second quarter results and the subsequent discussion during the conference call indicate several key points that will influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Earnings Growth**: Despite a challenging economic environment, Nike reported a 6% increase in revenue and a 13% increase in earnings per share, which are positive indicators[1].

2. **Cost Management and Financial Discipline**: The company emphasized its focus on cost management, with measures such as reducing demand creation spending, lowering personnel costs, and implementing a hiring freeze. This financial discipline is likely to be viewed positively by investors[1][3].

3. **Inventory Management**: While inventory levels are higher than desired, particularly in footwear, the company is taking steps to manage this through outlet stores and tighter buying practices. This proactive approach should mitigate potential risks[1][3].

4. **Global Performance**: Strong performance in emerging markets, particularly in China and the Americas, offsets some of the weakness in more mature markets. This diversification is a positive sign for long-term growth[1][3].

5. **Cautious Outlook**: The management expressed caution about the broader economic environment but remained confident in Nike's ability to navigate through these challenges. This balanced view suggests that the company is prepared for various scenarios[1][3].

Given these points, the overall tone is positive but tempered by caution due to the economic environment. However, Nike's strong brand, financial discipline, and proactive management of challenges are likely to support the stock price.
