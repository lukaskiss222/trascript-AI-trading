The earnings transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter and Full Year results presents several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Revenue Growth**: NIKE reported 11% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, exceeding expectations. This broad-based growth across all geographies and product categories is a positive indicator[1][2][3].
- **Innovation and Digital Growth**: Significant investments in innovation, digital transformation, and direct-to-consumer channels have driven strong growth, particularly in digital revenue which grew 35%[1][2][3].
- **Gross Margin Expansion**: Gross margin expanded by 80 basis points in Q4 and 90 basis points for the full year, driven by strong full-price sales and enhanced product profitability[1][2][3].
- **SG&A and Tax Rate**: Despite higher SG&A expenses and a higher tax rate, the company's overall financial performance remains strong. However, these factors slightly dampened the bottom-line results[1][2][3].
- **Future Outlook**: The company reiterated its guidance for fiscal year 2020, expecting high single-digit revenue growth and continued margin expansion, albeit with some headwinds from foreign exchange and strategic supply chain investments[1][2][3].

Given these points:

- The strong revenue growth, innovative product pipeline, and successful digital transformation are positive factors.
- The slight miss on earnings due to higher SG&A and tax rates might cause some short-term volatility but does not overshadow the overall strong performance and future outlook.

**Conclusion**: The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's robust growth, innovative strategies, and strong financial performance.
