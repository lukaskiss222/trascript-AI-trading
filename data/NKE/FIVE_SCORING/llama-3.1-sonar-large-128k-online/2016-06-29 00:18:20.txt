Based on the transcript of Nike's Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year earnings call, here are the key points that influence the short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: Nike reported a 6% increase in revenues to $32.4 billion, with a 17% increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.16. However, the fourth quarter diluted EPS was flat at $0.49, which might be seen as slightly disappointing given the strong full-year performance[2][4").

2. **Gross Margin**: The gross margin expanded 20 basis points for the full year but contracted 30 basis points in Q4 due to inventory management issues, higher labor costs, and foreign exchange impacts. This mixed performance could lead to some short-term volatility[2][4].

3. **Guidance**: The company provided guidance for fiscal 2017, expecting high single-digit revenue growth on a reported basis and mid single-digit growth in Q1, which is generally in line with expectations but slightly impacted by FX headwinds[4].

4. **Inventory and Channel Management**: Nike is working through inventory issues in North America, which affected Q4 revenue. However, the full-price in-line market is now clean, and the company is confident about maintaining a healthy pull market and managing inventory effectively[4].

5. **Geographic Performance**: Strong growth in Western Europe and Greater China, particularly in categories like Sportswear, Running, and Jordan Brand, underscores the company's global strength. However, North America's flat Q4 revenue growth due to timing issues might raise some short-term concerns[4].

6. **Innovation and Consumer Demand**: The company's focus on innovation, digital transformation, and consumer engagement is driving growth. The positive feedback on new products and the strong performance of the Nike+ app suggest long-term growth potential[4].

Given these points:

- The overall financial performance for the year was strong, but the fourth quarter EPS was flat, which might lead to some initial stock price pressure.
- The guidance for fiscal 2017 is generally positive but includes some caution due to FX headwinds.
- The company's long-term strategies and innovation pipeline are robust.

### Conclusion
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the flat Q4 EPS and inventory management issues, but the strong full-year performance and positive long-term outlook should mitigate significant declines.
