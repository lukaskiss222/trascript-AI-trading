The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2018 First Quarter Conference Call reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

### Financial Performance
- Revenue was flat at $9.1 billion, with a decline in North America wholesale revenue offset by growth in international markets and NIKE Direct businesses[2][4].
- Gross margin contracted by 180 basis points, primarily due to foreign exchange headwinds and a higher mix of off-price sales[2][4].
- Earnings per share decreased by 22% to $0.57, driven by gross margin decline and a higher effective tax rate[2][4].

### Strategic Initiatives
- The company is heavily invested in its Consumer Direct Offense, which includes a focus on digital transformation, personalization, and speed to market. This strategy is expected to drive long-term growth[4].

### Market Dynamics
- The North American retail landscape is undergoing significant disruption, with store closures, bankruptcies, and a promotional environment. However, NIKE has maintained market share and is focusing on growing its NIKE Direct businesses and strategic partnerships[4].

### Guidance
- For Q2, revenue growth is expected in the low single-digit range, with contraction in North America and Converse offset by strong international growth. Full-year revenue growth is expected in the mid single-digit range[4].

Given these points:

- The short-term financial performance, particularly the decline in gross margin and EPS, may put pressure on the stock price.
- However, the company's strong strategic initiatives, international growth, and focus on digital transformation and consumer direct connections suggest long-term potential.
- The ongoing retail disruption in North America and the promotional environment could lead to short-term volatility.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the financial results and market dynamics, but the long-term strategy and international growth provide a positive outlook.
