The transcript for Nike's fiscal 2006 third quarter conference call presents several key points that suggest a positive outlook for the company, despite some challenges.

- **Revenue and Profit Growth**: Nike reported a 9% revenue growth to $3.6 billion, with net income up 19% to $326 million and diluted EPS up 23% to $1.24. This indicates strong financial performance[5`.
- **SG&A Leverage**: The company achieved 120 basis points of SG&A leverage, which helped offset lower gross margins and contributed to profitability[5].
- **Innovation and Product Success**: The launch of the Air Max 360 was highly successful, and other product lines such as Nike Pro and Brand Jordan also performed well. This innovation and execution are expected to continue driving growth[5].
- **Global Performance**: Strong growth was seen in emerging markets like China, Russia, and Latin America, while the Americas region also delivered outstanding results. Although Western Europe and Japan faced challenges, the company is confident in its strategies to improve these regions[5].
- **Inventory Management**: While inventory levels were higher due to early orders and expansion of company-owned retail, the company does not see this as a significant negative impact on future growth and profitability[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, successful product launches, and confident outlook for future growth.
