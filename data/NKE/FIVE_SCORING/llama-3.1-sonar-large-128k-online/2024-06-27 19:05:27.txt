The earnings transcript for NIKE, Inc. reveals several key points that will likely influence the short-term stock performance:

## Revenue and Guidance
- NIKE reported a 2% decline in Q4 revenue, which was below analysts' expectations. The company also revised its fiscal 2025 guidance downward, expecting mid-single digit revenue declines, with the first half being particularly challenging[1][3%.

## Segment Performance
- The lifestyle business saw significant declines, while the performance product segment showed strong growth. However, the digital business declined 10% due to softer traffic and higher promotions[1][3.).

## Macro and Operational Challenges
- The company faced increased macro uncertainty, worsening foreign exchange headwinds, and softer consumer trends in key markets like Greater China and EMEA[1][3].

## Innovation and Strategic Actions
- Despite these challenges, NIKE is aggressively accelerating its innovation pipeline, particularly in performance products, and is seeing positive responses from new releases such as the Pegasus 41. The company is also focusing on managing its classic footwear franchises more aggressively to balance its portfolio and drive long-term growth[3].

## Financial Outlook
- The revised guidance includes expectations of gross margin expansion and modest SG&A growth, but the first quarter is anticipated to be particularly challenging due to various timing factors and continued headwinds[3].

Given these points, the immediate stock reaction is likely to be negative due to the missed revenue expectations, reduced guidance for fiscal 2025, and the ongoing challenges in key markets and digital channels.

## Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and ongoing macro and operational challenges.
