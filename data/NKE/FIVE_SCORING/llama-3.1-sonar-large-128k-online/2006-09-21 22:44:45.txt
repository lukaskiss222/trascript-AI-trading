The transcript for Nike's fiscal 2007 first quarter conference call presents several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Top-Line Growth**: Nike reported a 9% increase in revenues, driven by strong performances across most regions and product categories. This indicates a solid start to the fiscal year and aligns with the company's long-term growth targets[4].

2. **Challenges in Gross Margins and Inventory**: Despite the revenue growth, gross margins declined due to higher air freight, discounts, and input costs. Inventory levels were also higher than desired, although management is confident that this will normalize by the second half of the year[4].

3. **Positive Outlook and Strategic Initiatives**: The company is optimistic about its future, highlighting innovative products like Nike Plus, strong performance in sport culture and international markets, and a robust inventory management plan. The reorganization into category-focused segments is expected to enhance consumer connections and drive further growth[4].

4. **Demand Creation and SG&A**: Increased demand creation spending, particularly around the World Cup and Nike Air relaunch, and the new accounting for stock options, affected earnings per share. However, the company expects SG&A leverage for the year, excluding stock option charges[4].

Given these points, here are the key takeaways for the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Positive Revenue Growth**: Strong top-line growth is a positive indicator.
- **Temporary Margin and Inventory Issues**: These are expected to be managed and improved over the next few quarters.
- **Strategic Initiatives and Positive Outlook**: The company's focus on innovation, category segmentation, and international growth are long-term positives.

### Conclusion

While there are some short-term challenges related to gross margins and inventory, Nike's strong revenue growth, innovative product pipeline, and strategic initiatives suggest a positive outlook. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
