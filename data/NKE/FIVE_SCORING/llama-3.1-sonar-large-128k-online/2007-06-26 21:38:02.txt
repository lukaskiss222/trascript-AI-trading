Based on the earnings transcript and the financial results presented, here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on Nike's stock price:

## Revenue and Sales
- Nike reported an 8% year-over-year decline in revenues for Q2 FY25, with NIKE Direct revenues down 13% and wholesale revenues down 3%[2][4].
- Q4 FY24 revenue was flat on a currency-neutral basis, but Q2 FY25 saw a significant decline, indicating ongoing challenges[1][4).

## Gross Margin and Net Income
- The gross margin decreased by 100 basis points to 43.6% due to higher discounts and changes in channel mix[2][4].
- Net income fell by 26%, and diluted EPS decreased by 24% to $0.78[2][4].

## Management's Tone and Guidance
- Despite the challenges, management emphasized continued investment in demand creation, cost management efforts, and a focus on repositioning the business to enhance long-term shareholder value[1][4].
- The company maintained strong shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases[2][4].

## External/Macro Influences
- Increased macro uncertainty and worsening foreign exchange conditions have impacted Nike's performance and guidance[1].

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Nike's stock appears challenging due to the revenue decline, reduced gross margin, and lower net income. However, the company's commitment to cost management and shareholder returns provides some stability.

### Conclusion
The immediate financial challenges and reduced guidance are likely to put short-term pressure on the stock.
