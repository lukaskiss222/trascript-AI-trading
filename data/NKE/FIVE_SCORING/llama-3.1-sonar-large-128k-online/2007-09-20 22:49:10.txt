The earnings transcript for NIKE, Inc. for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 presents several positive and some mixed signals that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Signals
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: NIKE reported an 11% increase in worldwide revenues, driven by growth in all three product business units and all four geographic regions. This includes a 22% revenue increase in the Asia-Pacific region and a 16% increase in the European region[4].
- **High EPS Growth**: Earnings per share grew 51%, aided by a one-time tax benefit, and 24% excluding this benefit. This indicates strong operational performance and efficient tax management[4].
- **Improved Margins and Cash Flow**: Gross margins expanded by 70 basis points, and free cash flow from operations grew 47%, reflecting improved productivity and cash conversion cycle[4].
- **Positive Futures Orders**: Futures orders grew 10% on a constant dollar basis, indicating continued demand and growth potential[4].

### Mixed Signals
- **U.S. Region Performance**: While the U.S. region saw a 2% revenue growth, this was driven by changes in shipment timing and weaker sales to athletic specialty accounts. However, Nike-owned retail stores in the U.S. showed a 13% growth, and comp-store sales increased 4%[4].
- **Inventory and Retail Challenges**: Despite strong overall performance, there were mentions of retail inventory challenges and softer sales in certain categories like basketball and core sports culture apparel[4].

### Management's Tone and Guidance
- **Confident Outlook**: Management expressed confidence in reaching their long-term growth targets, including a goal of $23 billion in revenue by FY11. They also highlighted ongoing investments in retail, digital initiatives, and category focus, which are expected to drive future growth[4].
- **Strategic Alignments**: The decision to divest Nike Bauer Hockey and the strategic review of the Exeter Brands Group indicate a focus on optimizing the portfolio for maximum growth potential[4].

### Conclusion
Given the strong revenue growth, improved margins, and positive futures orders, combined with management's confident tone and strategic focus, the overall impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. However, the mixed performance in the U.S. region and some retail challenges might temper the enthusiasm slightly.
