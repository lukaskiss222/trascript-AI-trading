The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2012 second quarter results indicates several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: NIKE, Inc. reported an 18% increase in revenue, driven by robust growth across nearly every geography and category, which is a positive indicator[3）。
2. **Gross Margin Pressure**: Despite strong revenue, gross margins were down 260 basis points due to higher product costs and significant FX headwinds. This pressure is expected to continue, with full-year gross margin anticipated to be down at least 160 basis points[3].
3. **Price Increases and Inventory Management**: The company has implemented price increases to mitigate the impact of higher input costs, and inventory levels have plateaued. However, inventory costs remain high due to input cost inflation[3].
4. **Future Outlook and Guidance**: NIKE raised its full-year revenue expectations to mid-teens growth but expects continued gross margin pressure. The company is confident in its ability to manage through economic uncertainty and deliver long-term sustainable growth[3].
5. **Innovation and Brand Strength**: The company highlighted its strong innovation pipeline, particularly in digital technology, and the power of its brands, which are expected to drive growth and consumer engagement[3].

Given these points, here are the implications for the stock price:

- The strong revenue growth and positive futures orders suggest ongoing demand and market strength, which is positive.
- However, the gross margin pressure and expected continuation of this trend could offset some of the positive momentum.
- The company's confidence in managing through economic uncertainty and its focus on innovation and brand strength are long-term positives but may not immediately impact short-term stock performance.

Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
