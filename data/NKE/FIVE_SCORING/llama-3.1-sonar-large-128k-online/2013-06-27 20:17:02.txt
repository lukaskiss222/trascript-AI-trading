The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and full-year results call presents several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Nike reported strong revenue growth, with an 8% increase to $25.3 billion for the full year and a 7% increase in Q4 revenue. Gross margins expanded, and EPS grew 11% to $2.69, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower tax rate[1][3].

2. **Innovation and Growth Strategies**: The company emphasized its commitment to innovation, particularly through technologies like Flyknit, and its strategy to drive growth through premium product offerings, strong brand connections, and enhanced retail experiences. This suggests a strong foundation for continued growth[1][3].

3. **Leadership Transition**: The transition of Charlie Denson and the appointment of Trevor Edwards as the new President of the Nike Brand were discussed, but the overall tone indicated a smooth transition and continued leadership stability[1].

4. **China and Global Markets**: While China's revenue growth was flat in Q4 due to ongoing adjustments, the company is optimistic about long-term growth in this market. Strong performance in other geographies, such as North America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Emerging Markets, also contributed to the positive outlook[1][3].

5. **Macro Economic Factors**: The impact of foreign exchange rates and labor cost inflation were noted, but the company expressed confidence in its ability to manage these challenges effectively[1][3].

Given these points, the overall sentiment is positive, with strong financial performance, a robust innovation pipeline, and a solid strategy for growth. However, some short-term headwinds from currency and labor costs are acknowledged.
