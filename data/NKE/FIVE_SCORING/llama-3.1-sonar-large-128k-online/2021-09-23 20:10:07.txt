The transcript of NIKE, Inc.’s Fiscal 2022 First Quarter Conference Call highlights several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Revenue and EBIT Growth**: Despite supply chain headwinds, NIKE reported a 16% revenue growth and a 22% EBIT growth, indicating robust consumer demand and brand momentum[2][4].

2. **Supply Chain Challenges**: The company faced significant supply chain disruptions, including factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia, and increased transit times, which are expected to impact revenue growth in the short term. This led to a revision in the fiscal 2022 revenue guidance from low double-digit growth to mid-single digit growth[4].

3. **Digital Growth and Consumer Engagement**: NIKE's digital business continued to grow strongly, with a 25% increase in digital revenue, and the company saw significant engagement through its membership program and innovative retail experiences[4].

4. **Inventory and Production Issues**: The loss of production weeks and extended transit times are expected to result in inventory shortages in the next few quarters, particularly affecting the holiday and spring seasons. However, the company is optimistic about inventory supply improving as they head into fiscal year 2023[4].

Given these points, here is the likely short-term impact on NIKE’s stock price:

- While the strong financial performance and continued digital growth are positive indicators, the short-term supply chain issues and revised revenue guidance could create near-term pressure on the stock.

- The company's ability to manage through these challenges and its long-term growth prospects remain strong, but the immediate impact of supply chain disruptions may outweigh these positives in the short term.

Therefore, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be slightly negative due to the near-term challenges, but the overall long-term outlook remains positive.
