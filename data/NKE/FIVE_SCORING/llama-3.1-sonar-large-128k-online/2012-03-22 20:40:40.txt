The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2012 third quarter results indicates several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: NIKE, Inc. reported a 15% revenue growth, driven by robust growth across the NIKE Brand and other businesses, particularly Converse[3].
- **Innovation and Brand Strength**: The company introduced several innovative products, such as the NIKE FuelBand, Nike+, and Flyknit technology, which are expected to drive long-term growth and margin expansion[3].
- **Global Demand**: Double-digit growth in key categories, strong futures orders, and positive performance in various geographies, including North America, Emerging Markets, and China, suggest robust demand[3].
- **Operational Efficiency**: Management is focused on optimizing resources, managing inventories, and leveraging SG&A to maintain profitability despite input cost inflation and currency challenges[3].

### Challenging Factors:
- **Inventory and Gross Margin**: Higher inventory levels, particularly in Sportswear apparel in Europe and China, and lower than expected gross margin improvements due to input cost inflation and inventory management efforts, could create short-term pressure[3].
- **Cost Pressures**: Ongoing labor and material cost increases, although easing, continue to impact margins. However, the company is confident in its ability to manage these through pricing and innovation[3].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong revenue growth, innovative product pipeline, and the company's ability to manage costs and inventories, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term. However, the immediate challenges related to inventory and gross margins may temper the enthusiasm slightly.
