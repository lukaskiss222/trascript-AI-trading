The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2010 second quarter results presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company's short-term performance. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Earnings**: Despite a 4% decline in second-quarter revenues, NIKE, Inc. managed to maintain strong financial discipline, with improved gross margins in some areas, lower SG&A expenses, and a better tax rate. However, diluted earnings per share decreased by 5% due to lower revenue and gross margin pressures[4].

- **Futures Orders and Inventory Management**: Futures orders for Nike brand footwear and apparel showed a sequential improvement, although they were down 1% on a currency-neutral basis. Inventory management has been strong, with a 10% decline in inventory levels, which helps maintain brand strength and profitability[4].

- **Geographical Performance**: There are signs of recovery in certain geographies, such as China and Western Europe, while others like North America and Central and Eastern Europe remain challenging. The emerging markets continued to deliver strong results[4].

- **World Cup and Marketing Initiatives**: The company is highly optimistic about the upcoming World Cup, expecting it to drive significant growth, especially in Western Europe and other key markets. Other marketing initiatives like Fresh Air are also expected to boost performance in the second half of the fiscal year[4].

- **Operational Efficiency and Retail Performance**: NIKE, Inc. has improved its retail capabilities, with strong direct-to-consumer sales growth, particularly online. Better execution in retail operations, such as improved conversion rates and product flow, has also contributed to better performance[4].

Given these points, here is the prediction for the short-term impact on the stock price:

- The company's ability to manage through a challenging economic environment, its strong inventory management, and the anticipated boost from the World Cup and other marketing initiatives suggest a positive outlook.
- However, the immediate revenue decline and margin pressures might temper short-term enthusiasm.

Therefore, the likely short-term impact on the stock price is:
