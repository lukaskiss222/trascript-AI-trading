The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2013 First Quarter conference call presents several key points that can influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Strong Revenue Growth**: NIKE reported a 10% increase in revenue, with a 15% growth on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong demand across nearly all geographies and categories. This robust growth is a positive indicator[3].

2. **Innovation and Brand Strength**: The company highlighted its innovative products and strong brand connections, which have driven consumer engagement and revenue growth. This innovative pipeline, including products like Flyknit, is expected to continue fueling growth[3].

3. **China Challenges**: Despite being the industry leader in China, NIKE faces near-term volatility due to inventory management issues, economic slowdown, and a shakeout in the broader industry. However, the company is taking decisive actions to adjust its strategy, which may impact short-term financial results but is expected to lead to sustainable growth in the long term[3].

4. **Gross Margin Pressure**: The Q1 gross margin was 80 basis points below the prior year, and the company anticipates continued pressure from weaker foreign currencies. However, they expect sequential gross margin improvement in the second half of the fiscal year[3].

5. **Market and Consumer Trends**: The company is seeing strong performance in key categories like Running, Basketball, and Men's Training, and there is a positive outlook on market share opportunities in China as local brands struggle[3].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong revenue growth, innovative product pipeline, and long-term strategic investments, despite some near-term challenges in China and gross margin pressure.
