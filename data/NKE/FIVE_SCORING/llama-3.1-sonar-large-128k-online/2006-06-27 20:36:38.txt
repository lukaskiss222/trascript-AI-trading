The earnings transcript for NIKE, Inc. for fiscal 2006 presents several key points that indicate a strong performance and optimistic outlook, but also highlights some challenges and factors that could influence short-term stock performance.

### Key Points:
- **Revenue and Earnings Growth**: NIKE reported a 9% increase in revenues to nearly $15 billion, with an 18% growth in earnings per share, excluding a one-time charge[3|.
- **Geographic Performance**: Strong growth was seen in the U.S., Asia Pacific, and emerging markets like China, Russia, and Brazil. Europe faced challenges but showed resilience[3|.
- **Product Categories**: Significant growth in footwear, particularly in the U.S., and strong performance in apparel, especially premium and performance segments[3|.
- **Gross Margins and SG&A**: While gross margins declined due to higher input costs and product investments, tight expense management led to 80 basis points of SG&A leverage[3|.
- **Future Outlook**: NIKE expects high single-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2007, stable gross margins, and SG&A leverage. However, the first quarter is expected to be weaker due to higher input costs and demand creation spending[3|.
- **Inventory and Forward Orders**: Inventory growth was higher than sales growth, partly due to timing and transit issues, but the company is confident in managing this without significant implications[3|.
- **Consumer Connectivity and Innovation**: Emphasis on connecting with consumers through innovative products like Nike Plus and strong brand initiatives such as Joga Bonito[3%.

### Short-Term Implications:
- The strong revenue and earnings growth, combined with a positive outlook for fiscal 2007, are likely to support the stock price.
- However, the anticipated weaker first quarter due to higher costs and demand creation spending, along with inventory management concerns, might introduce some volatility.
- The company's ability to manage gross margins and SG&A, as well as its focus on innovative products and consumer connectivity, suggests long-term strength.

### Conclusion:
Given the overall strong performance and the company's positive outlook, despite some short-term challenges, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
