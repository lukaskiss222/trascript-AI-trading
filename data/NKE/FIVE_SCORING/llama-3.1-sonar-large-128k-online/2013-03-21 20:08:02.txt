The Q3 earnings call for Nike, Inc. presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Strong Financial Performance
- Nike reported a strong Q3 with 9% revenue growth on a reported basis and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Diluted EPS grew 20% to $0.73, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower tax rate[3.).

## Innovation and Product Demand
- The company highlighted significant innovation in products such as Nike Flyknit, Mercurial Vapor IX, and Air Max 2013, which have been well-received by consumers. This innovation is expected to continue driving growth[3].

## Geographic Performance
- North America and Central and Eastern Europe showed strong growth, while Western Europe's performance was mixed due to economic challenges in Southern Europe. China is undergoing a strategic reset to manage inventory and improve productivity, which may affect short-term revenues but is expected to yield long-term benefits[3].

## Inventory and Supply Chain Management
- Nike is actively managing inventory levels, especially in China, to ensure a balanced supply and demand. This may result in lower reported revenues in the short term but is seen as a necessary step for long-term sustainability[3].

## Future Guidance
- The company expects full-year revenue growth at a mid to high single-digit rate and EPS growth approaching mid-teens. For Q4, they anticipate mid-single digit revenue growth and gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points[3].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong financial performance, innovative products, and a strategic approach to managing challenges in key markets like China. However, the short-term impact on stock price might be tempered by the ongoing inventory management issues in China and the mixed performance in certain European markets.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, innovative product successes, and robust long-term growth prospects. However, the immediate challenges in China and Western Europe might prevent a significant rally.
