The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter results suggests several key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: NIKE reported a 5% revenue increase and a 24% increase in diluted earnings per share, which is generally positive. However, the revenue missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which could have a short-term negative impact[2].

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company provided guidance for Q4 with mid-single-digit reported revenue growth and high single-digit currency-neutral growth. However, they also mentioned a more promotional environment in North America, which might keep the stock price stable or slightly subdued in the short term[5].

3. **Innovation and Strategy**: NIKE emphasized its "Triple Double" strategy, focusing on doubling innovation, speed to market, and direct connections with consumers. This long-term strategy is positive but may not immediately impact the stock price.

4. **FX Headwinds**: The company faces significant foreign exchange headwinds, particularly in fiscal year 2018, which could continue to pressure earnings and stock performance in the near term[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the revenue miss, ongoing FX headwinds, and a more promotional retail environment in North America. However, the company's strong earnings growth, innovative strategies, and positive long-term outlook should mitigate some of this pressure.
