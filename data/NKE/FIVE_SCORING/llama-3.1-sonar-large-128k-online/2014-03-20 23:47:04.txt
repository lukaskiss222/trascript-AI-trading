Nike’s fiscal 2014 third quarter results and the accompanying conference call transcript indicate several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: Nike reported a 13% increase in revenue, with strong growth across various geographies and categories, including double-digit growth in key categories like sportswear, running, and basketball[2][3|.
- **Innovation and Consumer Connection**: The company highlighted significant innovations, such as the use of 3D printing, Flyknit technology, and other breakthrough products, which are resonating well with consumers and driving growth.
- **Digital and DTC Growth**: Nike saw a 23% growth in Nike Brand DTC, driven by strong online sales and improved retail experiences, which is a positive indicator for future growth.
- **Future Orders**: Futures orders increased 14% on a currency-neutral basis, indicating robust demand and a strong outlook for the next quarter.

### Challenging Aspects:
- **Currency Headwinds**: The company faced significant foreign exchange headwinds, which reduced EPS growth by 6 percentage points in Q3 and are expected to continue impacting results in Q4 and into fiscal 2015.
- **SG&A and Operational Costs**: Higher SG&A spending and operational investments, while strategic, could temporarily pressure margins.
- **Geopolitical Risks**: The situation in Russia, though currently not impacting Nike’s business significantly, poses a risk that could affect future operations.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong revenue growth, innovative product launches, and positive future orders, despite the currency headwinds and higher operational costs, the overall sentiment is positive. However, the immediate short-term impact of currency and operational costs might temper the stock's reaction.
