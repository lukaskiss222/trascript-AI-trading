Nike's Q3 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that will likely influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Brand Performance**: Nike's brand strength, particularly in footwear, has driven revenue growth and market share gains, even in a challenging economic environment.
- **Innovation and Product Success**: Innovations from the Olympics, such as Fly Wire technology, are resonating well across various categories, and products like the Kobe IV and Jordan True Flight are performing strongly.
- **Cost Management**: The company has successfully reduced SG&A expenses and is streamlining its management structure to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.
- **Diversified Portfolio**: The performance of other brands like Converse, Hurley, and the potential of Umbro, despite current challenges, suggests a robust portfolio.

### Negative Factors
- **Revenue Decline**: Reported third-quarter revenues declined 2%, and futures orders for the next five months are down, reflecting weaker market conditions and currency impacts.
- **Impairment Charge**: The significant after-tax impairment charge of $241 million related to Umbro reduced Q3 earnings per share.
- **Gross Margin Pressure**: Gross margins declined due to higher product costs, discounts, and currency effects, which are expected to continue in the fourth quarter.
- **Cautious Outlook**: The company maintains a cautious view on revenue growth for the remainder of fiscal 2009 and the first half of fiscal 2010 due to challenging comparisons and economic conditions.

### Conclusion
Given these factors, the short-term impact on Nike's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The company's strong brand performance and cost management efforts are balanced by revenue declines, impairment charges, and gross margin pressures. However, the long-term growth prospects and strategic initiatives to manage the current environment suggest that any short-term downturn may be limited.
