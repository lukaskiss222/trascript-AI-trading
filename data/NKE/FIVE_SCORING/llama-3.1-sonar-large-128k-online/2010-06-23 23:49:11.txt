The transcript for NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and full-year results indicates several positive trends and some challenges that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Trends:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: NIKE reported record gross margins, EPS, and cash flow, with a significant increase in free cash flow and a strong balance sheet[4}.
- **Momentum in Key Markets**: The company saw growth in North America, Greater China, and emerging markets, driven by innovative products, brand strength, and premium distribution[4].
- **Successful Product and Marketing Initiatives**: The World Cup campaign and other marketing efforts drove substantial growth in football and other categories, indicating strong brand execution[4].

### Challenges and Headwinds:
- **Macro Economic Uncertainties**: High unemployment, input cost inflation, and volatility in commodity, currency, and equity markets are expected to continue, which could impact reported top and bottom-line results[4].
- **Currency Headwinds**: The stronger dollar and weaker European currencies are expected to reduce reported revenue growth and put pressure on gross margins[4].
- **Input Cost Inflation**: Increased costs for raw materials, labor, and freight are anticipated to affect gross margins[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the macroeconomic headwinds and currency impacts, but the underlying strong performance and momentum in key markets suggest that the company is well-positioned for long-term growth.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be slightly negative due to the immediate challenges, but the overall positive trends and management's confident outlook suggest that the negative impact will be limited.
