The transcript for Nike's fiscal 2009 fourth quarter and full-year results indicates a mixed but generally positive outlook despite the challenging economic environment. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Profitability**: Nike reported steady revenues on a constant dollar basis, with a 3% growth to $19.2 billion for the full year, although Q4 revenues were down 7% due to currency fluctuations. Net income and EPS declined due to restructuring charges, but excluding these, Nike saw a 10% increase in comparable EPS[4].

- **Cost Management and Efficiency**: The company implemented strict cost management, including a significant reduction in SG&A expenses and a restructuring that laid off over 1,750 employees. This resulted in over $1.2 billion of free cash flow from operations[4].

- **Market Performance**: Nike gained market share in most major markets, particularly in the U.S. and emerging markets. The company's subsidiary brands, such as Converse and Hurley, performed well, while Cole Haan and Nike Golf faced challenges[4].

- **Guidance for Fiscal 2010**: Nike expects flat to slightly down revenues on a currency-neutral basis for the first half of fiscal 2010, with hopes for a return to top-line growth in the second half. The company anticipates FX headwinds to impact gross margins, but expects strong cash flow generation and will resume share repurchases[4].

- **Consumer and Market Trends**: Despite economic challenges, Nike sees continued demand for premium products and is focusing on innovation, deep consumer connections, and marketplace management. The company is optimistic about its position in key markets, particularly China and emerging markets[4].

Given these points, here is the short-term impact analysis:

- **Positive Factors**: Strong cost management, innovation, and market share gains. The company's financial discipline and cash flow management are strong.
- **Challenging Factors**: Lower revenues expected in the first half of fiscal 2010, FX headwinds, and continued economic uncertainty.

Overall, Nike's strategic positioning, cost management, and innovative product pipeline suggest resilience and potential for growth, despite short-term challenges.
