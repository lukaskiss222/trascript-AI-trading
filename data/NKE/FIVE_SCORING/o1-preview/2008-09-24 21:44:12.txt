Nike's Q1 earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, with a 17% increase in revenue and an impressive 240 basis point rise in gross margins. The success at the Beijing Olympics boosted brand visibility, leading to over 50% revenue growth in China and futures orders up nearly 50%, indicating strong momentum. Management's confident tone, positive guidance, and the announcement of a new $5 billion share repurchase program suggest a strong short-term outlook for the stock.
