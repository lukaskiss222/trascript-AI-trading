While Nike reported strong revenue growth and a robust performance in key markets like North America, declining gross margins due to higher input costs and currency headwinds may concern investors. Additionally, slowing growth and higher inventory levels in China and Western Europe could contribute to short-term pressure on the stock. As a result, the stock price is likely to experience a negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
