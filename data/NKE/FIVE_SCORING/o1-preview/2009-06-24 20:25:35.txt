Nike's earnings call highlighted a challenging quarter, with diluted EPS down due to restructuring charges and futures orders declining by 5% on a currency-neutral basis. Management expects lower revenues in the first half of fiscal 2010 and acknowledges ongoing economic headwinds. While the company remains optimistic about long-term growth, the near-term outlook and tempered guidance suggest the stock may face short-term pressure.
