Nike reported strong Q3 results with a 15% increase in revenue and an 11% rise in EPS, driven by double-digit growth across key categories and geographies. Management expressed optimism about future growth, highlighting an 18% rise in global futures orders and the launch of innovative products like the Nike FuelBand and Flyknit technology. While there are concerns about declining gross margins due to input cost inflation and higher inventories in certain regions, the overall positive performance and exciting upcoming events like the Olympics are likely to boost investor confidence in the short term.
