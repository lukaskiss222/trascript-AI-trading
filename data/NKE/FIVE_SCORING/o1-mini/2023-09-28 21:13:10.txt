NIKE reported solid quarter-over-quarter growth, particularly in direct sales and store performance, while maintaining confidence in its long-term strategy and margin improvements. Despite a slight decline in gross margins this quarter, the optimistic guidance and strong management tone suggest positive short-term sentiment. Investors are likely to respond favorably in the next couple of weeks.
