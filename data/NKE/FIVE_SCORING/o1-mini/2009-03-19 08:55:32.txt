Nike reported a decline in reported revenues and a significant drop in diluted EPS due to impairment charges, which may worry investors in the short term. However, the company's strong brand performance, cost-cutting measures, and positive outlook on footwear and basketball segments could help mitigate some negative sentiment. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
