NIKE reported solid revenue growth and strong performance in digital sales, highlighting robust brand momentum and strategic investments. However, concerns over high inventory levels, increased costs, and cautious guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainties may counterbalance positive aspects. Overall, the stock is likely to remain relatively steady in the short term.
