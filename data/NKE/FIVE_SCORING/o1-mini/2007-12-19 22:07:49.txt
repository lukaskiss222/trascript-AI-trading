NIKE reported a robust second quarter with strong global revenue growth, particularly in China and the CEMEA region, and provided positive guidance for the second half of the year. Despite some challenges in the U.S. apparel segment, the company's strategic investments in digital and retail expansion, along with effective inventory management, suggest confidence in sustained growth. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
