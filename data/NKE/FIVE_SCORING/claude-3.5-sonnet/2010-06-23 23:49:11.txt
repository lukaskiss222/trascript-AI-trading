Based on the earnings transcript analysis, Nike demonstrated strong momentum and execution despite macro challenges. Key positives include record gross margins, clean inventory, strong futures orders (+10% constant currency), and accelerating growth in key markets like China (+12% in Q4) and emerging markets (+28% constant currency). However, management guided to significant headwinds in FY2011 from currency, rising input costs, and air freight expenses that could pressure gross margins by up to 100bps. The overall tone was confident but appropriately cautious given the macro environment.

Over the next 1-2 weeks, I expect the stock to react positively given:
1) Strong futures growth and clean inventory signal healthy demand
2) Market leadership gains during downturn position company well for recovery
3) Management demonstrating both offensive growth investments and cost discipline
