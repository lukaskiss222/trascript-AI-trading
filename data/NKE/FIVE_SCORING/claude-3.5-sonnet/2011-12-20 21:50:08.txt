Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis for Nike's short-term stock outlook:

Positives:
- Strong revenue growth with global revenue up 18% and North America up 21%
- Robust futures orders up 13% globally
- Healthy growth in China (revenues +28%) and emerging markets
- Strong innovation pipeline highlighted for Olympics and Euro Championships
- Effective supply chain management with improving factory deliveries

Negatives:
- Significant gross margin pressure (-260bps) expected to continue
- Increasing FX headwinds impacting international profits
- Higher than expected discounting needed to clear inventory
- Western Europe facing economic challenges
- Unit growth slowing and inventory levels remain elevated (+35%)

The company showed impressive top-line momentum but faces meaningful margin pressures in the near-term from input costs, FX, and discounting. While long-term fundamentals remain strong, these headwinds will likely limit stock appreciation over the next 1-2 weeks.
