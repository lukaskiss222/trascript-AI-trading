Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week impact on Nike's stock:

Main points:
- Strong Q2 results with revenues up 6% and EPS up 13%, but management is taking a notably cautious stance on the outlook
- Planning for significant SG&A cost controls and tighter inventory management while maintaining strategic investments
- Consumer demand remains solid but macro uncertainty is high, with promotional pressures increasing in Europe and China
- Management is confident in their competitive position but openly acknowledging unprecedented lack of economic visibility
- Guiding to slower growth and lower margins in second half, with SG&A expected to be flat to down

The company delivered solid results but is clearly signaling more challenging conditions ahead. While Nike is well-positioned competitively with a strong balance sheet, the combination of cautious guidance, margin pressures, and broader market uncertainty will likely weigh on the stock in the very near-term.
