Based on this earnings call transcript, Nike demonstrated strong performance across most metrics but faces some challenges in key markets. The company showed robust growth in North America (+18%), healthy expansion in Western Europe, and continued innovation in product development (especially Flyknit technology). However, there are ongoing inventory and market reset challenges in China that will take several quarters to resolve. Management provided optimistic initial FY2014 guidance of high single-digit revenue growth and EPS growth approaching mid-teens targets. Overall, while there are some regional headwinds, Nike's strong brand, innovation pipeline, and financial discipline position it well for continued growth. The balanced tone and specific growth initiatives outlined by management suggest positive momentum.
