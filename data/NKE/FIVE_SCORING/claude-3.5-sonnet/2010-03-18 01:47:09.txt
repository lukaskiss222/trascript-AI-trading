Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Nike's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Strong financial results with revenue up 7%, expanding gross margins (+300bps), and clean inventory positions showing operational excellence

2. Positive forward indicators including futures orders up 9%, accelerating growth in key markets like China (+10%), and strong momentum in apparel

3. Management's confident tone about their competitive position and ability to leverage major upcoming sporting events like World Cup 2010

The results and commentary suggest Nike is executing well and building momentum across geographies and categories, which should drive positive sentiment and stock performance in the near-term.
