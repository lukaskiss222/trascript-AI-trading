Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess the short-term stock impact as positive but moderate. Here's my reasoning:

Key Positives:
- Strong revenue growth with NIKE Brand futures orders up 18% 
- Continued momentum in North America (revenue +17%) and emerging markets (+30%)
- Successfully implementing price increases with good consumer acceptance
- New innovations like Flyknit showing strong potential
- Healthy demand trends and exciting product pipeline heading into Olympics/Euro 2012

Key Concerns:
- Gross margin pressures persisting longer than expected
- Inventory levels higher than desired in Europe/China Sportswear apparel
- Input cost inflation continuing to impact margins
- Conservative guidance for Q4 gross margins

The strong top-line growth and successful pricing power demonstrate brand strength, while new innovations provide future catalysts. However, near-term margin headwinds and inventory issues may limit upside. Overall, the positives modestly outweigh the negatives for the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
