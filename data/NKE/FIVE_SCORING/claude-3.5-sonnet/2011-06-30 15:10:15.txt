Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Nike's stock price. Key positives include:

- Strong revenue growth with FY11 up 10% to $20.9B record
- Raised FY15 revenue target from $27B to $28-30B showing confidence
- Healthy futures orders up 15% 
- Strong execution of category strategy driving growth across segments
- Geographic expansion momentum in China, Brazil and emerging markets
- Plans to offset margin pressures through pricing and cost efficiencies

While there are some headwinds like input cost inflation and gross margin pressure in the near-term, the company demonstrated strong operational performance, clear growth strategies, and ability to manage through challenges. Management's confident tone and raised long-term targets suggest positive momentum.
