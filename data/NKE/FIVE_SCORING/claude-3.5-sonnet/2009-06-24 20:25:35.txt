Based on my analysis of Nike's Q4 2009 earnings call, I anticipate a slightly positive short-term impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

1. Strong inventory management and cash position ($3.5B in cash)
2. Market share gains in key markets despite tough conditions
3. Premium products continuing to sell well
4. Management's confident tone about competitive positioning

However, there are some headwinds:
- Currency headwinds impacting margins
- Cautious revenue guidance for FY2010
- Ongoing weakness in apparel segment

Overall, while facing macro challenges, Nike demonstrated strong execution and financial discipline while maintaining brand strength. Management's measured optimism and strong balance sheet should provide support for the stock.
