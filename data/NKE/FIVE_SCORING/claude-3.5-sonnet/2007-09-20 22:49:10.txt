Based on the earnings call transcript, I see strong positive indicators for Nike's stock in the next 1-2 weeks:

Key positives:
- Strong Q1 results with revenue up 11% and EPS up 51% (24% excluding one-time tax benefit)
- International growth accelerating, particularly in China (+50%) and Europe
- Healthy futures orders up 10% globally
- Clean inventory position and improving margins
- Management confident in growth strategy and retail expansion plans
- Currency tailwinds supporting results

Minor concerns:
- Some softness in US mall-based retail
- Higher planned SG&A spending
- Q2 earnings projected flat year-over-year

Overall, the strong international momentum, clean inventory, and management's confident tone suggest the stock should react positively in the near-term despite some challenges in the US market. The global growth story remains compelling.
