Based on my analysis of Nike's Q4 and full year earnings call, I expect a clearly positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key factors supporting this view:

Positives:
- Strong revenue growth of 11% with gross margin expansion of 170bps
- Healthy futures orders up 12% on currency-neutral basis
- Excellent momentum in North America (+10%) and Western Europe (+18%)  
- Progress in China reset showing results with DTC comps +22%
- Digital/ecommerce growing 40%+ with accelerating pace
- Strong World Cup activation driving brand momentum

Minor Concerns:
- Currency headwinds impacting reported results
- Higher SG&A spending in Q4
- Some inventory build (up 13%)

The company demonstrates strong execution across geographies, robust growth drivers (women's, direct-to-consumer, digital), and clear management confidence in the strategy and outlook. While there are some minor headwinds, the overall business momentum and positive trends should drive the stock higher in the near-term.
