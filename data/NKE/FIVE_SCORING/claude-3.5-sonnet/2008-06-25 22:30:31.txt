Based on the earnings call transcript, I believe the stock price is likely to have a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks for the following reasons:

- Strong financial performance with revenue up 16% and EPS up 14% for the quarter, marking 27 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth
- Healthy global futures orders up 11%, indicating continued momentum
- Robust growth in key markets including China (+50%) and emerging markets
- Effective management of costs and margins despite inflationary pressures
- Confident outlook and strategic investments in growth initiatives

While there are some near-term headwinds around SG&A spending and the Umbro acquisition integration, the overall business fundamentals and management's confident tone suggest the stock should react positively.
