Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Nike's stock:

Key Positives:
- Strong 9% revenue growth and high single-digit futures orders
- International growth remains robust, especially in China (+30%)
- Sport culture/lifestyle segment growing rapidly (+28%)
- Healthy innovation pipeline and strong brand momentum

Key Concerns:
- Gross margins declined 120bps due to higher costs and discounting
- Inventory growth (15%) significantly outpacing sales growth
- Continued challenges in UK and Japan markets
- Higher SG&A spending expected in Q2

Overall, while there are some near-term margin and inventory pressures, Nike demonstrated solid top-line momentum and provided generally confident forward guidance. Management addressed key concerns credibly and maintained their full-year targets. The fundamental growth drivers appear intact.

Given Nike's strong market position and management's clear strategy to work through the temporary headwinds, I expect a modestly positive reaction in the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
