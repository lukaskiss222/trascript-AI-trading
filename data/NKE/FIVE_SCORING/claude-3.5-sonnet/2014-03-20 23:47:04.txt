Based on the earnings call, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Nike's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong revenue growth of 13% led by broad-based gains across geographies and categories
2. Gross margin expansion of 30 basis points 
3. Robust futures orders growth of 14% globally
4. Successful progress on the China reset strategy with improving retail metrics
5. Strong momentum in digital/ecommerce with 57% growth

While there are some headwinds from currency impacts and increased SG&A spending, the underlying business fundamentals remain very strong with Nike executing well across its portfolio. The company's innovative product pipeline, particularly around the World Cup, should drive continued growth.
