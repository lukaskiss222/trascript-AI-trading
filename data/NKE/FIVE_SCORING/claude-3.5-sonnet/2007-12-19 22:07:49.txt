Based on this detailed earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on NIKE's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong Financial Performance:
- Revenue up 14% with growth across all regions
- EPS grew 11% to $0.71
- Futures orders up 13% globally
- Gross margins expanded 90 basis points
- Strong performance in emerging markets (China +37%, CEMEA +30%)

2. Management Confidence & Execution:
- Disciplined inventory management (inventories +3%, -2% constant currency)
- Strategic portfolio optimization (divestiture of non-core brands)
- Clear focus on high-growth opportunities (China, digital, retail)
- Confident tone regarding ability to manage margins despite cost pressures

3. Forward-Looking Catalysts:
- Beijing Olympics and Euro Championships on horizon
- New retail concept stores launching in 90 days
- Strong futures orders in international markets
- Strategic marketing investments planned for upcoming major events

The combination of strong current performance, management execution, and near-term catalysts should drive positive stock price momentum.
