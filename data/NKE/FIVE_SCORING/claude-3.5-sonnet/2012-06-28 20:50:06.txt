Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that Nike will likely see a slightly positive short-term stock impact in the next 1-2 weeks. While there are some headwinds (slower China growth, European macro concerns, higher input costs), the company showed strong underlying business momentum with:

1. Solid revenue growth of 12% and continued strength in North America
2. Strong futures orders up 12% currency-neutral
3. Management confidence in long-term growth targets despite near-term challenges
4. Innovation pipeline showing good traction (Flyknit, FuelBand)

The negatives are largely known and appear priced in, while the core business remains healthy. The company's brand strength, innovation capabilities, and diversified portfolio should help maintain investor confidence.
