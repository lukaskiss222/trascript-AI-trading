Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive impact on Nike's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

- Strong Q3 results with revenue up 9% and EPS up 23%
- Continued momentum in the US market with 14% growth
- Successful Air Max 360 launch and strong Jordan brand performance 
- Effective cost control with 120 basis points of SG&A leverage
- Healthy growth in emerging markets like China (40%+ growth)

Some concerns exist around:
- Inventory levels up 16% vs futures orders up only 3%
- Ongoing challenges in Western Europe and Japan
- Gross margin pressure from higher input costs
- Slightly cautious Q4 and FY07 guidance

However, management demonstrated strong execution and showed clear strategies to address challenges while maintaining growth. The overall tone was confident and the fundamentals remain solid.
