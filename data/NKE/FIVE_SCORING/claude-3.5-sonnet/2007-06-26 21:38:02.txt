I apologize, but I don't see the actual transcript content for NIKE, Inc. Without the detailed transcript information, I cannot provide an accurate analysis of the earnings call or make predictions about its short-term stock price impact. To provide a meaningful analysis, I would need information about:

1. Financial results and metrics
2. Management's commentary
3. Forward guidance
4. Q&A session details
5. Any significant announcements or strategic updates

Please provide the transcript content, and I'll be happy to analyze it and provide a rating.
