Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Nike's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong fundamental performance with revenues up 8% to over $25B, gross margins improving, and healthy futures orders up 8% globally

2. North America continues to show exceptional strength with 18% revenue growth and strong momentum across categories

3. Management expressed high confidence in their strategy and innovation pipeline while effectively managing headwinds in China

4. The company maintains a very strong balance sheet with $6B in cash and plans to return more capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks

While there are some minor headwinds from FX and labor costs, the overall tone was quite positive with strong operational execution and clear strategic direction. The planned management transition appears well-orchestrated and shouldn't disrupt momentum.
