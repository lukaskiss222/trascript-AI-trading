Based on the earnings call transcript, I'm bullish on Nike's short-term stock outlook for the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive indicators include:

1. Strong direct-to-consumer performance with online sales up 23% and store comps up 9%, showing robust consumer demand
2. Improving futures orders trends, especially in key markets like China and Western Europe
3. Tight inventory management (-10% YoY) helping maintain margins
4. Clear strategic plans around major catalysts like World Cup 2010
5. Strong market share gains across footwear and apparel categories

While there are some headwinds like broader economic uncertainty and the Tiger Woods situation, the core business fundamentals appear solid with good momentum heading into 2010. Management's confident tone and specific growth initiatives suggest positive near-term stock performance.
