Based on the earnings call transcript, Nike demonstrated strong revenue growth and market positioning but faces significant near-term margin pressures. Key positives include 9% futures order growth, strong performance in North America and China, and continued brand strength. However, the company expects gross margins to decline at least 300 basis points next quarter due to higher input costs and air freight expenses. While management plans to implement broader price increases starting in Spring 2012, these won't offset cost pressures until later in FY12. The cautious tone around margins and delayed pricing benefits suggests near-term stock pressure despite solid top-line trends.
