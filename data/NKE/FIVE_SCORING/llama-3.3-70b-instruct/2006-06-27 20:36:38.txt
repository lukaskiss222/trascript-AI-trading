NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2006 fourth quarter conference call reveals a strong year for the company, with record annual sales and impressive growth in various regions and product categories. The company's focus on innovation, consumer connectivity, and strategic investments in emerging markets such as China and Brazil positions it well for future growth. Although the gross margin declined slightly due to higher input costs and shifts in product mix, the company's ability to leverage SG&A spending and deliver solid revenue growth is expected to support its long-term earnings targets.

The company's outlook for fiscal 2007 is cautiously optimistic, with expectations of high single-digit revenue growth and essentially flat gross margins. While the first quarter is expected to be challenging due to comparisons with a strong prior-year period and higher demand creation spending, the company anticipates delivering EPS growth for the second half and the full year. The $3 billion share repurchase program announced recently demonstrates the company's confidence in its prospects and commitment to creating value for shareholders.

Overall, the Company's financial health, strategic growth initiatives, and strong brand position suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
