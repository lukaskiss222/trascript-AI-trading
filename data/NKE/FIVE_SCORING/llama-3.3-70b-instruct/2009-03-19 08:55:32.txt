Nike's Q3 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with reported revenues declining 2% but currency-neutral revenue increasing 2%. The company's focus on innovation, brand strength, and consumer connection helped drive growth in key categories like running and basketball. However, gross margin declined due to higher product costs, discounts, and currency fluctuations. Management's tone was cautiously optimistic, with a focus on managing the business for long-term growth and navigating the challenging macro environment.
