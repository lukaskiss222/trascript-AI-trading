NIKE's Q2 earnings call revealed strong top-line performance, driven by innovative products, brand strength, and premium distribution. The company's revenue growth accelerated, with global revenues up 18% and Nike Brand futures orders up 13%. However, gross margin pressure remains a concern due to higher input costs and FX headwinds. Despite this, management expressed confidence in their ability to manage costs and deliver long-term growth. The stock is likely to experience positive momentum in the short-term due to the company's strong brand positioning, innovative products, and growth opportunities in key markets like China.
