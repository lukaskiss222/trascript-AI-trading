NIKE's Q2 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, expanding gross margins, and a solid performance across various regions and product categories. The company's focus on emerging markets, particularly China and CEMEA, is yielding promising results, with revenues increasing by 37% and 30%, respectively. Management's guidance for low double-digit revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2008 and gross margin expansion is positive. The company's strategic moves, such as the acquisition of Umbro and divestitures of non-core brands, demonstrate its commitment to optimizing portfolio performance and potential.
