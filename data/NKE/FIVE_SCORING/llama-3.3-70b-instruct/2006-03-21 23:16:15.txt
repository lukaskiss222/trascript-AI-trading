Nike's Q3 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by broad-based increases across most major wholesale accounts, as well as robust performance in Nike-owned retail. The company's focus on innovation, execution, and strategic investments in emerging markets, such as China, Russia, and Brazil, contributed to its success. However, gross margin pressures, primarily due to higher input costs, and a higher tax rate, tempered the net income growth. Management's guidance for Q4 and FY07 suggests continued revenue growth, albeit at a slower pace, with ongoing gross margin pressure and expectations for SG&A leverage. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and margin concerns, but the company's long-term growth prospects and strong brand portfolio remain intact.
