Nike's Q3 earnings transcript reveals a mixed picture, with the company achieving record quarterly earnings despite gross margin pressure from rising input costs. Management expressed confidence in their ability to mitigate these costs through pricing actions, supply chain management, and operational discipline. While the company faces short-term headwinds, their strong brand, innovative products, and diversified portfolio position them well for long-term growth. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around input costs, but the company's fundamentals remain strong.
