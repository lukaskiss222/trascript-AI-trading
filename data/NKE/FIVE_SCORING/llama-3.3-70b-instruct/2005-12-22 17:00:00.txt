Nike's Q2 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by demand in the US and emerging markets, and a solid financial performance despite challenges in Western Europe and Japan. The company's focus on product innovation, demand creation, and strategic investments in key markets, such as China, positions it for long-term growth. While gross margins were lower than expected due to higher commodity costs and supply chain expenses, management's commitment to delivering SG&A leverage and investing in critical business initiatives suggests a positive outlook.
