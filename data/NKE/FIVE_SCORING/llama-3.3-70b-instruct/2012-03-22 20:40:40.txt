NIKE's Q3 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by innovative products and deep consumer connections. The company's focus on digital technology, sustainability, and strategic expansions positions it well for long-term growth. Although gross margin declined due to input cost inflation and inventory management efforts, the company expects sequential improvement in Q4 and a higher gross margin in FY 2013 compared to FY 2012. With a strong brand portfolio, robust demand, and a solid innovation pipeline, NIKE is well-positioned to drive growth and profitability. However, near-term headwinds from input cost inflation and currency fluctuations may impact the stock price in the short term.
