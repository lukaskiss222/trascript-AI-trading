NIKE's Q1 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by a 16% increase in global revenue on a constant-currency basis, with double-digit growth in Running, Basketball, and Men's Training categories. The company's brand strength, innovative products, and transformative distribution strategy contributed to its success. However, gross margin declined 80 basis points due to higher input costs and shifts in the mix of business. Management expressed confidence in the company's long-term potential, particularly in China, where they are taking decisive action to expand their leadership position and drive sustainable growth. Despite near-term challenges, NIKE's strong brand, diverse portfolio, and financial discipline position it for continued growth.
