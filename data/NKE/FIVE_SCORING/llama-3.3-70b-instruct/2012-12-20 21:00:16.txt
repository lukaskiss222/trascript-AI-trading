NIKE's Q2 earnings call revealed strong momentum, with 7% revenue growth and 11% diluted EPS growth. The company's focus on innovation, digital transformation, and strategic investments in key markets like North America and China is expected to drive long-term growth. Although gross margin was down 30 basis points, management attributed this to mix changes and currency fluctuations, and expressed confidence in their ability to drive higher gross margins over time. With a strong balance sheet and a trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital of 20.4%, NIKE is well-positioned to manage risks and seize opportunities in a volatile global economy. The company's guidance for low double-digit revenue growth in Q3 and mid-single-digit growth in Q4 suggests a positive outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.
