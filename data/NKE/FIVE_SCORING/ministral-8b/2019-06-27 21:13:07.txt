**Analysis:**

NIKE's Q4 and full-year earnings call highlighted strong performance across various categories and geographies, with notable growth in digital, women's apparel, and basketball. The company's strategic transformation is evident in its investments in innovation, digital, and speed, which are driving growth and profitability. Management's focus on the consumer and brand connection is evident in the strong demand for NIKE products. The company's currency neutral performance and strong brand heat provide a clear view of its fundamentally strong growth and expanding profitability. However, the company faces challenges in certain categories and geographies, such as apparel and core product under $100 price point products, which management is addressing through product refresh and new designs. Additionally, the company is facing supply chain challenges, particularly in the core zone, where demand is outpacing supply. Overall, NIKE's strong performance and strategic transformation position it well for continued growth and value creation.

**Conclusion:**

Given NIKE's strong performance, strategic transformation, and long-term growth prospects, the short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. The company's focus on innovation, digital, and speed, along with its strong brand heat and currency neutral performance, provide a solid foundation for continued growth and profitability.
