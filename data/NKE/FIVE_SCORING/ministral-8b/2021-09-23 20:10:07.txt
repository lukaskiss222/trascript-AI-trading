### Analysis:
The NIKE, Inc. earnings call for Q1 2022 revealed strong financial performance, with revenue growth of 16% and EBIT growth of 22% compared to the prior year. The company's digital transformation, especially through NIKE Digital, has been a significant driver of growth. However, the call also highlighted significant supply chain challenges due to increased transit times and factory closures, particularly in Vietnam. This has led to a downward revision of revenue guidance for fiscal 2022 to mid-single digits, with Q2 expected to be flat to down low single digits. Despite these headwinds, management remains confident in the long-term prospects of the company, emphasizing its strong brand, digital transformation, and innovation.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on NIKE's stock price is likely to be negative due to the downward revision of revenue guidance and the uncertainty surrounding supply chain issues. However, the company's long-term growth prospects, driven by its digital transformation and strong brand, suggest that the stock may bounce back in the long run. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure but may rally once the supply chain issues are resolved and investors refocus on the company's long-term growth potential.
