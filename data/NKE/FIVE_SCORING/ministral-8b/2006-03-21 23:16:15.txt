**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Nike, Inc. revealed a strong third quarter, with revenue growth of 9% and net income growth of 23%. The company highlighted its ability to manage between top-line growth and bottom-line profitability, with significant SG&A leverage driving earnings growth. However, the call also noted challenges in Western Europe and Japan, where revenue growth was weaker than expected.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Nike's stock price is likely to be positive, driven by the strong third-quarter results and the company's ability to manage profitability. However, investors should be aware of the challenges in Western Europe and Japan, as well as potential inventory issues. The company's focus on innovation and execution, as well as its commitment to long-term growth, should also be considered. Overall, the call provides a mixed picture, with strong short-term results and long-term opportunities, but also challenges that need to be addressed.
