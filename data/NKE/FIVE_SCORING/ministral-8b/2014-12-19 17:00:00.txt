**Analysis:**

Nike's Q2 results were strong, with revenue up 15% and EPS up 25%. The company's growth was driven by strong demand for premium products, particularly in the women's and digital segments. Management highlighted the company's ability to balance growth and risk, with a focus on innovation and strategic investments. The company's outlook for the full year was positive, with expectations for low double-digit revenue growth and a 100-125 basis point expansion in gross margin. However, the company also noted the impact of currency fluctuations and input costs on its results. The stock market is likely to react positively to these results, with investors likely to focus on the company's strong performance and positive outlook.
