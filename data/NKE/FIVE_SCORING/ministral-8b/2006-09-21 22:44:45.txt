### Analysis

The earnings call for Nike Inc. for the fiscal 2007 first quarter reveals a strong start to the year with top-line growth and solid performance across various product segments and regions. The company reported revenues growing 9% to over $4 billion and earnings per share declining due to lower gross margins, timing of demand creation spending, and a first-time charge for stock options. Management is optimistic about the future, expecting continued growth and steady improvement in gross margins. The company is also pursuing strategic growth through product innovation and category-specific focus, which should drive long-term success. However, the call also highlights challenges in certain markets, such as the U.K. and Japan, which will require ongoing management and strategic adjustments.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on Nike's stock is likely to be positive, driven by the strong top-line growth and management's optimism. The company is well-positioned to navigate market challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities. The stock is likely to see some volatility in the coming weeks due to the ongoing challenges in certain markets and the need for strategic adjustments. Overall, the stock is expected to perform well in the next 1-2 weeks.
