**Analysis:**

NIKE, Inc. reported strong Q2 results, driven by robust holiday sales and digital growth. The company's Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is paying off, with digital sales growing 11% and NIKE Digital now making up 25% of total NIKE brand revenue. The company's focus on innovation, brand storytelling, and digital transformation is evident in its product launches and partnerships. However, supply chain disruptions, particularly in Vietnam, are a concern, with production still not fully normalized. The company remains optimistic about the future, expecting revenue growth of mid-single digits for the fiscal year and a continued expansion of gross margin.

**Conclusion:**

The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks due to strong Q2 results and the company's optimistic outlook. The focus on digital transformation and innovation, as well as the company's strong brand position, are likely to be well-received by investors. However, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the uncertainty around the Omicron variant could pose short-term headwinds.
