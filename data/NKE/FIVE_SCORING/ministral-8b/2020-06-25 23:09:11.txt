### Analysis

The earnings call for Nike, Inc. for fiscal 2020 Q4 and full year provided a comprehensive overview of the company's performance and strategic initiatives. Key highlights include:

1. **Financial Performance**: Nike reported a 38% decline in Q4 revenue due to store closures and lower wholesale shipments, partially offset by digital growth. Gross margin decreased by 820 basis points due to higher product costs and inventory obsolescence. Despite these challenges, digital growth was significant, with digital revenue reaching $5.5 billion for the full year.

2. **Strategic Initiatives**: The company announced a new phase of its Consumer Direct Offense, dubbed "Consumer Direct Acceleration," focusing on three key areas: creating a marketplace of the future, a new consumer construct, and investing in digital capabilities. This strategy aims to accelerate digital growth and improve consumer engagement.

3. **Inventory Management**: Nike took proactive measures to manage inventory, including canceling pre-COVID-19 factory purchase orders, shifting inventory to digital channels, and increasing digital fulfillment capacity. These actions helped to clean up inventory by the end of Q4.

4. **Financial Strength**: The company emphasized its strong financial position, with $12.5 billion in total available liquidity and a high return on invested capital. This financial strength allowed Nike to invest in digital capabilities and manage costs effectively.

### Short-Term Implications
