Nike's fiscal year '09 performance exceeded expectations in a challenging economic environment, with solid revenue growth, particularly in key performance and sports categories, and an impressive EPS growth despite conditions. However, the company's cautious guidance for flat to slightly declining revenue in the first half of FY2010, along with potential gross margin pressures due to FX fluctuations, signals a cautious short-term outlook. The proactive inventory management and product pipeline optimism suggest resilience and potential for share gain, yet the market may react with caution to the conservative forecasts and macroeconomic concerns.
