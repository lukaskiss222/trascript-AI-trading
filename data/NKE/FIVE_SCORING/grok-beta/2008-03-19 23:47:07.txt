NIKE Inc.'s fiscal 2008 third quarter earnings call showcased a 16% revenue increase, 35% EPS growth, and a 24.3% return on invested capital, indicating strong operational performance and market positioning. Despite global economic uncertainties, NIKE's focus on football (soccer), expansion in China, and solid growth in various subsidiary brands, along with surgical pricing strategies, positions the company well for short-term gains. However, the heavy investment in market expenses may exert some pressure on near-term profitability.
