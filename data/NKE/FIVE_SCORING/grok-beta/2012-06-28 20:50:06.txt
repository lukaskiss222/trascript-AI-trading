Nike's fiscal 2012 Q4 call highlighted high revenue growth but lower earnings. The positive aspects include strong market performance, with 16% revenue growth for the year, reaffirmed sales targets through fiscal 2015, and anticipation of future orders despite challenges. However, concerns arise from decreasing gross margins due to higher input costs, softening demand in China, and macroeconomic headwinds. The short-term outlook shows potential inventory overhangs, increased SG&A for demand creations, and conservatism due to currency fluctuations, which could weigh on stock returns over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
