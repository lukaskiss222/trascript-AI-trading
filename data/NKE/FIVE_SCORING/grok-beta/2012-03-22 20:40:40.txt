NIKE's Q3 earnings highlight a robust performance with 15% revenue growth and strong EPS growth, driven by innovation products like the Nike FuelBand and significant growth in key markets like North America and China. However, the stock might face some pressure due to concerns about inventory management, particularly in sportswear apparel in Europe and China, as well as ongoing input cost inflation, potentially affecting gross margins in the short term.
