NIKE delivered a strong Q2 performance with significant revenue growth across all regions, especially in apparel and equipment, signaling robust demand and successful product innovation. However, concerns arise due to increased SG&A spending, currency impacts on inventory growth, and potential margin pressures from ongoing inventory liquidation efforts. The company's guidance for a high single-digit revenue growth and a slight decline in gross margins alongside investments in demand creation suggests a cautious approach to future earnings growth, potentially leading to a neutral short-term impact on stock price.
