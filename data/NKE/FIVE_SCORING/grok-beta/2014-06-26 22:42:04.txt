NIKE's strong performance in FY 2014, especially in key areas like football, running, and women's apparel, alongside robust growth in direct-to-consumer (DTC) and e-commerce channels, indicates a positive outlook. Their forward-looking strategies, investments in product innovation, consumer engagement, and digital expansion are likely to maintain this momentum. This should provide a positive boost to the stock in the short term, driven by the engagement surrounding the World Cup and sustained category growth. However, currency headwinds and the need to manage different geographies' performance could temper the immediate impact.
