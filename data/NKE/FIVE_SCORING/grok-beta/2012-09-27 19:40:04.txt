Nike's Q1 earnings call highlights several factors that suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock:
- Revenue was up significantly with a strong performance from the Nike brand and Converse across various geographies.
- Sales from direct-to-consumer channels showed robust growth, indicating strong brand excitement.
- Managementâ€™s confidence in the future was evident through announcements of new business strategies in key markets like China and North America, along with a commitment to innovation.

However, there are some concerns:
- Weakness in the Chinese market with futures down, which might induce caution.
- Despite revenue growth, EPS was below the previous year, and there are ongoing costs related to brand revitalization and inventory management in China. 

Given these points, the significant growth and management's long-term vision for high-margin products and market expansion will likely overshadow short-term challenges in China over the next 1-2 weeks, suggesting a positive stock reaction.
