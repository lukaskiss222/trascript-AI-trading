Nike's fiscal 2008 results indicate a strong performance across most regions, with a commitment to continue growing revenue and EPS, demonstrating resilience in a challenging market. The company's focus on innovation, strategic investments in marketing, retail infrastructure, and growth in emerging markets like China contribute positively to its outlook. However, concerns over the US sportswear apparel business and the dilutive impact of Umbroâ€™s acquisition might put some pressure on profit margins in the short term. Given these factors, the stock might experience a slight positive impact in the near term due to overall growth and strategic initiatives.
