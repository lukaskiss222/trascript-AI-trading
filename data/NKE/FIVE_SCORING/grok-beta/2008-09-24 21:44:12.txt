Nike’s Q1 earnings show strong brand performance and strategic investments, with revenue growth, improved gross margins, and robust futures orders, which together suggest potential positive momentum. However, a cautious consumer environment and potential currency fluctuations could moderate gains. Given the strong operational results and the company's focus on innovation and retail execution, there should be a net positive impact on the stock over the next 1–2 weeks.
