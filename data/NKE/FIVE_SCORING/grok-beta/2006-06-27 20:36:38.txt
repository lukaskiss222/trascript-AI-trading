Nike’s fiscal 2006 earnings result exhibited strong performance with revenue and earnings per share growth, alongside solid progress in emerging markets like China. However, the company’s guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 projects lower EPS, partly due to significant upfront investments in demand creation and the expected impact from stock option expenses. While Nike anticipates a recovery in gross margins and EPS growth over the year, the immediate post-earnings period might see profit-taking as some investors reduce exposure due to the near-term guidance. This suggests a potential slight dip in stock price in the upcoming weeks before stabilizing or rebounding as the positive long-term outlook gains traction.
