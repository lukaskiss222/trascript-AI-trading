Nike's fiscal 2010 fourth quarter results outperformed expectations with revenue up 8%, gross margins at record highs, and strong growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, despite a challenging global economy. However, management provided a cautious outlook for fiscal 2011, citing potential headwinds from currency changes, rising input costs, and continued economic volatility, with gross margins expected to be lower. The positive momentum in futures orders and brand strength suggests a strong consumer connection and potential resilience, but these known challenges could lead to a mixed short-term impact on the stock price.
