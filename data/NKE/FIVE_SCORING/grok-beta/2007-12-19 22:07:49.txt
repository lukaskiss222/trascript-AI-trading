Nike's performance in Q2 FY08 was robust, with global revenue up by 14% and increased gross margins. Management's positive outlook, focus on emerging markets, strategic market positioning, and disciplined inventory management suggest a potential upward trend in the stock price in the short term. The company's ability to grow amid economic headwinds and the promising growth in China, CEMEA, and other international markets, along with controlled investment in demand creation, bolster confidence in near-term stock performance.
