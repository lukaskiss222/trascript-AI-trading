Nike's Q2FY10 earnings call indicated mixed short-term signals. While the company underperformed expectations with a revenue decline and slight EPS reduction, several key factors suggest cautious optimism. The global macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, with some regions showing improvement while others like Japan lag, but Nike's ability to gain market share, manage inventory tightly, and diversify revenue sources provides resilience. The company's focus on product innovation, confirmed inventory reduction, strategic retail expansions, and an aggressive approach to the World Cup marketing could cushion the stock from a significant downturn and even inspire investor confidence in the next couple of weeks despite lowered guidance for full FY10 revenue.
