Nike's Q3 earnings call highlights high demand for their products, suggesting potential near-term growth but also indicates significant gross margin pressure from increasing input costs, FX headwinds, and airfreight reliance. Management's confidence in leveraging pricing power and supply chain efficiencies to mitigate these headwinds, combined with the promise of innovation, points to a nuanced outlook. The stock might experience initial negative pressure due to gross margin challenges, but the strategic moves and brand strength could lead to a rebound.
