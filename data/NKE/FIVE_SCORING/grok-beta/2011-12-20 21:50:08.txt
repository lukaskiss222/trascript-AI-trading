Nike's Q2 FY12 results exceeded expectations with mid-teens revenue growth, particularly strong in North America, driven by innovation and expanding market penetration. Although gross margins have declined due to higher input costs, pricing strategies, and inventory management show Nikeâ€™s preparedness to leverage its brand and product innovation to mitigate these impacts. The stock likely will see a positive reaction in the short-term due to the better-than-expected revenue growth.
