The earnings transcript from NIKE indicated strong Q3 growth across various categories, driven by innovation and global sports events. However, the guidance for FY '15 suggests slightly below mid-teens EPS growth due to currency headwinds, indicating some concern for short-term profit margin pressures and potential FX impacts on international sales. Overall, the positive performance and NIKEâ€™s emphasis on innovation and long-term growth strategies might suggest a mild positive stock movement, tempered by the volatility from currency fluctuations.
