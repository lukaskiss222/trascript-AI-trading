Disney reported strong Q4 results, particularly in its Parks and direct-to-consumer segments, with significant subscriber growth for Disney+. Management's focus on cost rationalization and upcoming initiatives like the ad-supported Disney+ tier signal positive short-term momentum. These factors are likely to bolster investor confidence and support the stock in the near term.
