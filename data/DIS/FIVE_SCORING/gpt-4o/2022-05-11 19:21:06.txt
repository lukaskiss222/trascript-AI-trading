The Walt Disney Company’s second-quarter 2022 results highlighted strong performance in both its domestic parks and streaming services, with notable subscriber growth across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Growth in domestic parks was propelled by increased per capita spending and significant demand for new attractions such as the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser. While international parks faced challenges with COVID-related closures, particularly in Asia, management remains optimistic about the ongoing recovery. The emphasis on expanding the Disney+ ad-supported tier is seen as a strategic move to broaden the subscriber base while maintaining profitability. With continued investment in content and expansion into new markets, Disney’s outlook remains positive, suggesting a favorable short-term impact on its stock price.
