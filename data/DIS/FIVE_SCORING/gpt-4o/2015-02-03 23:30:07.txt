Disney's earnings call highlights a strong first quarter, with EPS up 23% and a successful performance across its divisions driven by popular franchises like Frozen and a robust lineup for the year, including Avengers and Star Wars. Management's tone was optimistic with a focus on leveraging its franchises and expanding its parks, such as the Shanghai Disney Resort opening in 2016. The positive developments and plans announced indicate a likely short-term boost in investor sentiment, suggesting a potential rally in the stock price in the next 1-2 weeks.
