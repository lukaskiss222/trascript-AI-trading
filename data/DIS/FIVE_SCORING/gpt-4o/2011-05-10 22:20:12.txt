Disney's earnings call revealed a solid overall performance, with EPS up despite challenges including underperformance of "Mars Needs Moms" and impacts from the Japanese earthquake. The strength in Media Networks, particularly due to ESPN's advertising growth, and promising future film releases like "Pirates of the Caribbean 4" and "Cars 2" contribute positively to the outlook. Although there are concerns regarding the longer-term impact on Park margins due to fuel costs and diminishing DVD sales, the company's proactive cost management and optimistic future content slate are likely to bolster near-term investor sentiment and provide a mild positive impact on the stock over the next couple of weeks.
