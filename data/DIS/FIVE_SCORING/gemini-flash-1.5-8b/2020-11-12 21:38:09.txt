Disney's earnings call highlights strong direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscriber growth, particularly with Disney+.  Management expresses confidence in the long-term strategy of pivoting to a DTC-first model, despite acknowledging ongoing pandemic-related headwinds.  While the company anticipates challenges in the short-term, fueled by continued uncertainty around theatrical releases, park capacity constraints, and sports viewership, the bullish outlook on DTC growth and subscriber numbers suggests a potential short-term positive impact on the stock price, albeit potentially with volatility.
