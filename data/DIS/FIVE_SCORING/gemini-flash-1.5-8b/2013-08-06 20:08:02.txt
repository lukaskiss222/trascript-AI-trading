Disney's Q3 2013 earnings call highlighted strong performance in parks and resorts, driven by increased guest spending and attendance.  Management expressed confidence in ESPN's continued strong position, particularly in light of the recent acquisition of media rights.  However, the film studio segment faced challenges, with the significant loss anticipated on "Lone Ranger" impacting Q4.  These mixed results coupled with ongoing retransmission negotiations could negatively impact the stock short-term.
