Disney's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted significant investment in direct-to-consumer (DTC) initiatives, particularly ESPN+ and the upcoming Disney+ launch.  Management stressed the importance of these platforms for long-term growth, though the call also acknowledged foregone licensing revenue as a headwind.  The optimistic tone regarding the success of ESPN+, coupled with the preparations for Disney+, suggests a likely positive stock price impact over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
