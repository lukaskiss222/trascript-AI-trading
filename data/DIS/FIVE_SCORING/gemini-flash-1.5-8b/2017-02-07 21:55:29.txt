Disney's Q1 2017 earnings call highlights strong film performance, particularly with "Doctor Strange," "Moana," and "Rogue One," driving significant box office success.  The company also reported positive results for Shanghai Disneyland, which is reaching breakeven status ahead of schedule, and a strong start for Avatar Land's planned May opening.  Positive guidance, coupled with continued investments in direct-to-consumer offerings like BAMTech, and DisneyLife, suggests a strong short-term outlook, supported by anticipated upcoming releases.
