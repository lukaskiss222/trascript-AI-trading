Disney's earnings call highlights strong performance, driven by blockbuster films like "Alice in Wonderland" and "Iron Man 2."  Management expresses confidence in the company's future growth strategy, focusing on franchise films, and the upcoming summer slate.  The call also indicates continued investment in ESPN and Parks & Resorts, though challenges persist in achieving immediate, significant growth in parks attendance due to a recent shift away from deep promotional offers, and media network operations face some pricing pressures.  However, a positive outlook and the expected rebound in pricing, along with high demand for Disney properties, point to a positive short-term trend.
