Disney's earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, driven by continued success in their parks and resorts, studio entertainment, and cable networks (particularly ESPN).  Management expressed confidence in the studio's upcoming releases (Prince Caspian and WALLâ€¢E) and the resilience of their parks in a challenging economic climate.  This generally bullish outlook, coupled with significant share buybacks, suggests a likely positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
