Disney's earnings call highlights continued strength in ESPN, driven by strong sports rights acquisitions and advertising.  Management expresses confidence in the company's long-term strategy, particularly in parks and resorts.  However, the call mentions potential near-term headwinds, such as higher programming costs at ESPN and challenging studio comparisons in Q4.  This suggests a potentially slightly muted short-term stock impact, with a focus on long-term growth prospects.
