Disney's earnings call highlights significant disruptions due to COVID-19, impacting nearly all segments.  While management expresses confidence in the company's resilience, reduced guidance for parks and studio releases, coupled with the substantial impact on the cruise and theatrical divisions, suggests a negative short-term outlook for the stock price.  The company's focus on Disney+ and strategic adjustments like furloughs and dividend reductions, imply a measured but potentially impactful response to the crisis.
