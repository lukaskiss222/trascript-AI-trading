Disney's earnings call highlighted strong performance in parks, driven by robust guest spending and increased attendance, despite ongoing pandemic-related challenges.  Management remains optimistic about the future, with continued improvements in guest experiences and investments in park technology like Disney Genie.  The streaming service, Disney+, also showed positive trends, with solid subscriber growth and increased ARPU; however, the call noted that some streaming costs are increasing.  Overall, the call suggests potential short-term volatility due to the delta variant's effect on park attendance, but with a positive outlook driven by strong demand.
