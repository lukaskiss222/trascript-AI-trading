Disney's earnings call highlighted a strong Q3, driven by record Studio performance and a robust Parks and Resorts segment.  The acquisition of a stake in BAM Tech and the announcement of ESPN's presence on the DirecTV Now platform position the company well in the evolving direct-to-consumer market.  Management's optimistic tone and focus on leveraging existing intellectual property, along with the success of Shanghai Disney Resort, should provide a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
