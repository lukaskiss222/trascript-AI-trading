Disney's earnings call highlights strong financial performance, driven by growth in Interactive, Consumer Products, and Parks & Resorts.  Management is optimistic about future growth, with key announcements like the Star Wars release date and the Netflix deal. However, some operational details, like Cable Networks's lower operating income, warrant further investigation.  The overall tone is positive, but the short-term impact on the stock is likely to be very positive, driven by the positive narrative around these new investments.
