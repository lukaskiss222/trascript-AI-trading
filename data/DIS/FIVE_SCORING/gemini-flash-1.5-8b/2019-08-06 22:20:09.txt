Disney's earnings call indicates a short-term negative impact on the stock price.  While the company highlighted strong performance in some segments, like the film studio, significant headwinds were noted from the 21st Century Fox acquisition, particularly the underperformance of the Fox film studio and Star.  Lower-than-expected operating income and losses in certain parts of the acquired business suggest near-term concerns which may weigh on investor sentiment.
