Disney's earnings call reflects a cautious outlook amidst a challenging economic climate.  While management highlights the resilience of the parks sector and the strength of the brand, lowered guidance for DVD sales and concerns about advertising revenue suggest a continued soft spot in media networks.  The company's focus on cost-cutting across all divisions indicates an intent to weather the storm, which likely impacts the stock's short-term prospects negatively.
