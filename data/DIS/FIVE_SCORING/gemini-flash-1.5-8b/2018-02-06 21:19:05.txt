Disney's Q1 2018 earnings call highlighted strong performance in Parks and Resorts, driven by Pandora and Guardians of the Galaxy attractions and increased spending.  The studio segment showed solid box office results from *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*, *Thor: Ragnarok*, and *Coco*, although home entertainment revenue was lower than last year.  Management expressed optimism about the new ESPN+ platform and the overall acquisition of Fox assets, positioning the company for future growth.
