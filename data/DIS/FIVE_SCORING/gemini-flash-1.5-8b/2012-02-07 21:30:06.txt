Disney's Q1 2012 earnings call highlighted strong performances in Cable Networks and Parks & Resorts, driven by the Comcast deal, increased guest spending and attendance at domestic parks, and higher passenger cruise days.  Management expressed confidence in the future of ESPN due to the new agreement and the robust position of the overall Disney brand.  The call suggests positive short-term trajectory for the stock, particularly given the strong performance of key segments and positive guidance.
