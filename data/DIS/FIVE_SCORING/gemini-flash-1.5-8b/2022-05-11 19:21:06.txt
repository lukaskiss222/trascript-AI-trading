Disney's earnings call suggests strong short-term performance for the parks segment, driven by high domestic demand and strong guest spending.  Continued growth in streaming subscriptions, though potentially not as substantial a ramp-up in the second half compared to the first, and the positive reception to new content and attractions reinforces the positive outlook.  Management's confidence in the overall strategy and continued commitment to content creation points to a positive short-term impact on shares.
