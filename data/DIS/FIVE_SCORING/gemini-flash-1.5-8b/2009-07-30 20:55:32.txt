Disney's earnings call highlighted continued challenges in the current economic climate, particularly for the parks and resorts segment, but also revenue softness in the studio division.  Management expressed cautious optimism about economic stabilization but noted uncertainty around the pace and strength of recovery.  Positive aspects include the success of *UP* and upcoming films, and strong performance from ESPN and the Disney Channel.  The short-term implication is likely negative to neutral, given the cautious nature of guidance and the ongoing impact of the global economic downturn.
