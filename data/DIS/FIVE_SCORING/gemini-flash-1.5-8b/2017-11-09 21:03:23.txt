Disney's Q4 2017 earnings call highlighted a strong performance in Parks and Resorts, particularly international, offset by hurricane-related disruptions.  The Media Networks segment showed some challenges, but management expressed confidence in ESPN's value and the potential of the upcoming DTC launch.  The call's focus on strategic investments in direct-to-consumer and theme parks, along with continued buybacks, suggests a bullish outlook for the stock.
