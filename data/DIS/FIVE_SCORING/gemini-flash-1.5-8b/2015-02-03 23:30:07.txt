Disney's Q1 2015 earnings call highlighted strong performance across all divisions, particularly consumer products driven by Frozen's continued popularity and the studio's upcoming slate.  Management expressed optimism for the future, citing the success of new franchises and the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort in 2016.  While some near-term headwinds were acknowledged, like the high programming costs at ESPN and relatively slower theatrical results from prior year's blockbuster, management's upbeat tone and strategic initiatives suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock price.
