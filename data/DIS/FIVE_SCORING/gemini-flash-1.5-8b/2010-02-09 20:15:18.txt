Disney's Q1 2010 earnings call highlights strong performance in Parks & Resorts (despite some discounting) and ESPN (record ratings), but indicates some continued economic uncertainty.  Management's focus on content, brand building, and cost controls suggests a long-term strategy, while acknowledging the challenging near-term environment and late bookings.  The call suggests a moderate positive short-term outlook, likely bolstered by the recent success of films like *Toy Story 3* and strong international Disney Channel performance.
