Disney's Q2 2011 earnings call highlighted mixed results due to the poor performance of "Mars Needs Moms" and timing issues with Pixar DVD releases.  However, strong performance in Media Networks, particularly ESPN's strong ad revenue, and positive attendance and spending trends at theme parks suggest underlying strength.  Management's focus on higher pricing and reduced discounting, along with the upcoming summer film releases, positions the company for potential improvements in the coming weeks.
