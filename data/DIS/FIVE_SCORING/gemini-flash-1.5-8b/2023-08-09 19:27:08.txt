Disney's earnings call emphasized a focus on cost-cutting, improved DTC performance, and a clear strategy for growth in film studios, parks, and streaming.  Management expressed confidence in the long-term trajectory despite near-term challenges, with notable improvements in DTC operating income and subscriber growth, particularly with the ad-supported tier.  Price increases are expected, along with continued efforts to reduce account sharing. The short-term impact is likely positive due to the positive news on the DTC side, but potential headwinds related to the writers' & actors' strike and further cost-cutting measures might dampen the stock's rally by a small amount.
