Disney's earnings call highlighted a significant strategic shift towards direct-to-consumer streaming services, primarily through the acquisition of BAMTech.  The company's focus on its strong brands and expanding its ESPN and Disney streaming platforms suggests an aggressive strategy to capitalize on the changing media landscape.  This will likely lead to increased investments in original content and a potential short-term impact on revenue from licensing deals as the company diverts resources.
