Disney's earnings call highlights strong Q2 2012 performance, driven by "Avengers" success and increased attendance/spending at parks and resorts.  Management expressed optimism about future movies, park expansions (Cars Land), and continued international expansion.  Guidance suggests continued positive momentum for the near term, with potential for strong stock performance in the following weeks.
