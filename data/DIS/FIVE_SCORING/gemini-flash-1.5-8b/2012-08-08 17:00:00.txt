Disney's Q3 2012 earnings were very strong, exceeding expectations.  The company's performance across all segments, particularly the Studio and Parks & Resorts, was excellent, driven by successful film releases (Avengers, Brave) and strong park attendance and spending.  Management's tone is highly optimistic concerning future growth, with increased investments and anticipated returns in parks and resorts.
