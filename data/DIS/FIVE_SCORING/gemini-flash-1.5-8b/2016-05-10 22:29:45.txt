Disney's Q2 2016 earnings were strong, driven by record-breaking box office performance from *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, *Zootopia*, and *Captain America: Civil War*.  Management highlighted continued growth in Parks and Resorts, with strong domestic attendance and spending.  However, the anticipated impact of the shifting Easter and New Year's holidays impacted some segments, and lower advertising revenue at ESPN also influenced results, although management anticipates positive momentum in these areas in the future.
