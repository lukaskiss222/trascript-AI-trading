Disney's Q2 2013 earnings call highlighted robust performance across segments, driven by strong box office results for "Iron Man 3," record attendance at parks, and positive growth in cable networks.  Management expressed confidence in the company's future strategy, emphasizing the long-term value of recent acquisitions (Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm).  Guidance hints at potential headwinds in the near-term from production costs, but overall, the call suggests a positive outlook for the stock in the short-term, reinforcing its recent record highs.
