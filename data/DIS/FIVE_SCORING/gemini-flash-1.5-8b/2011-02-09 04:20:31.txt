Disney's Q1 2011 earnings call highlights strong financial performance across all segments, particularly in Media Networks and Parks.  Management emphasized continued strength in advertising and attendance growth at parks, driven by successful film releases and new attractions/ship.  Guidance for Q2 and the rest of the year acknowledges comparability issues, suggesting a potential deceleration in growth from Q1's exceptional results, but a positive outlook remains.
