Disney's Q1 2014 earnings call highlighted strong performance, particularly in the Studios segment driven by the continued success of "Frozen" and Marvel films.  Management's optimistic outlook and detailed guidance, along with the focus on franchise building (especially Disney and Marvel), suggest a positive short-term impact for the stock, boosted by the upcoming "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" release and the imminent launch of "Guardians of the Galaxy".
