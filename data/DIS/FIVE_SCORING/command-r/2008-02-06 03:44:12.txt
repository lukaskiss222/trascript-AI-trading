The strong performance of Disney's multiple creative engines, including ABC, ESPN, and Disney Channel, drove excellent Q1 results. The leveraging of successful franchises across various platforms, notably in consumer products and international markets, bodes well for future growth. Though parks and resorts attendance is robust, management's disciplined approach to cost control offers resilience against potential economic downturns. The Australia and New Zealand terbit market appears promising. With a diverse revenue stream, robust cash flow, and successful franchise strategy, Disney is well-positioned for the short term, even in the midst of a writers' strike.
