Disney's strong earnings performance in Q4 and its promising outlook for FY2013 were well received by investors. The success of recent acquisitions, such as Marvel and Pixar, bodes well for the company's future. However, some concerns arise from substantial increases in sports rights costs and the challenging comparison to exceptional home entertainment results in Q1 FY2013. The upcoming guest experience enhancement project at Disney World and the launch of Shanghai Disney Resort represent impactful investments in the short term but are expected to pay off in the long run. The stock will likely experience a positive, but modest, impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks. [1]
