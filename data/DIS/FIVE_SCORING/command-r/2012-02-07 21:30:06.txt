Disney's strong Q1 results, driven by Cable Networks and Parks & Resorts, are encouraging. The new Comcast deal highlights the value of their media networks, with growth potential in Espn and Disney Channel. The Studio segment's focus on fewer, high-return films and the successful launch of Disney Junior are positive steps. However, the drop in Physical Studios revenue is a concern. The prospects of continued affiliate growth and the value of the multi-channel business model bode well. After a strong start to the fiscal year, Disney's strategic initiatives and brand strength position them well for the remainder of 2012.  1
