Disney’s earnings call paints a picure of a company in growth mode. Strong performance across key business segments, especially in their streaming services, and the potential of their new Custom Content Group, were highlighted by management.

However, the company’ssoffstated commitment to investing in their new custom platform could provide upside potential if the market gains confidence in the untapped revenue streams it opens.
