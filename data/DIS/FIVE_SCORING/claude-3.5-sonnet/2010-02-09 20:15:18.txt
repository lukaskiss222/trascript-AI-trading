The earnings call reveals several positive indicators for Disney's short-term stock performance. Key positives include:

1. Strong advertising trends with scatter pricing up 30% above upfront levels at ABC
2. Improved attendance at domestic parks (+4% normalized)
3. ESPN showing record ratings and strong ad growth
4. Promising film slate including Marvel properties
5. Digital revenues exceeding $2B and new opportunities with iPad

Some moderate concerns include:
- Park bookings down 10% vs prior year
- Continued need for promotional discounting
- Home video market pressures

Overall, management conveyed confidence in their strategic positioning and ability to capitalize on both traditional and new digital opportunities. The fundamental business appears solid with multiple growth drivers intact.

Given the strong advertising trends, improved park attendance, and positive outlook shared by management, I expect a positive stock reaction in the 1-2 week timeframe.
