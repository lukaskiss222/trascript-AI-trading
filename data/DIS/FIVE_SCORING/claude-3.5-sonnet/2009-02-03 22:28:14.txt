Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of Disney's likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positives:
- Theme park attendance showing resilience despite economy, with successful promotions driving bookings
- Cable networks (ESPN, Disney Channel) maintaining relatively stable performance
- Strong franchise pipeline (Toy Story, Cars, Pirates sequels)

Key Negatives:
- Significant cost pressures and planned reductions across divisions
- Softness in advertising revenues, particularly at ABC
- DVD sales showing concerning trends beyond just cyclical weakness
- Large bad debt charges ($60M broadcasting, $25M cable)

While management demonstrated they are taking appropriate actions to address challenges, the near-term headwinds from advertising weakness, DVD secular decline, and margin pressure from park discounting will likely weigh on the stock. The market typically reacts negatively to companies taking significant cost reduction actions.
