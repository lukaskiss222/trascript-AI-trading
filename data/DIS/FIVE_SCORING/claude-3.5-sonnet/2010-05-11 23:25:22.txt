Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Disney's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong performance across multiple business segments, particularly the massive success of "Alice in Wonderland" ($962M global box office) and early success of "Iron Man 2" ($334M), indicating strong content momentum.

2. Robust advertising trends with scatter pricing 30% above upfront levels and double-digit ad sales growth at ESPN and TV stations, suggesting healthy revenue growth.

3. Strategic pricing improvements at Parks & Resorts with increased per-capita spending (+5%) and per-room spending (+8%), despite some volume trade-offs, indicating successful execution of their pricing strategy.

While there are some minor headwinds like increased costs at ESPN and temporary attendance pressure at parks due to reduced discounting, the overall tone is positive with strong content pipeline, advertising momentum, and successful strategic initiatives.
