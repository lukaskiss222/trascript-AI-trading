Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Disney's stock price. Key positives include:

1. Strong overall fiscal 2012 performance with record revenue, net income, and EPS despite challenges. Net income up 18% and EPS up 21% year-over-year.

2. Management expressed confidence in strong 2013 performance despite some Q1 headwinds, with multiple growth drivers including Parks expansions, new movie releases, and ESPN affiliate deals kicking in.

3. The Lucasfilm acquisition and Star Wars franchise potential adds significant long-term value, while immediate integration plans seem well thought out.

The main near-term concerns are Q1 cost pressures and some softness in ESPN ad sales, but these appear temporary and manageable within the context of Disney's broader momentum.

Given management's confident tone, strong fundamentals, and clear growth catalysts ahead, I expect the stock to react positively over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the results.
