Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Disney's stock:

Key Positive Points:
- Strong advertising trends with network scatter pricing 20% above upfront levels
- ESPN showing strong ratings and advertising momentum
- Theme park bookings improving after new promotions announced
- Management confident about upcoming film slate

Key Concerns:
- Disappointing early box office for "Christmas Carol" 
- Theme park margins under pressure from discounting and pension costs
- Continued secular challenges in home video/DVD business
- Studio restructuring costs and write-downs

The overall tone was cautiously optimistic, with management highlighting several encouraging trends while remaining prudent about costs given limited visibility. The executive changes (CFO/Parks swap) appear well-received. While there are some near-term headwinds, the positive advertising trends and theme park booking improvements should provide support.
