Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative short-term impact on Disney's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While management delivered solid FY2008 results, they highlighted significant near-term headwinds across multiple business segments: softening advertising market (both local and national), meaningful slowdown in theme park bookings (down ~10% for first half of FY2009), and general consumer spending pressures. Though Disney has strong brands and management experience navigating downturns, the immediate outlook suggests earnings pressure that will likely weigh on the stock in the very short term.
