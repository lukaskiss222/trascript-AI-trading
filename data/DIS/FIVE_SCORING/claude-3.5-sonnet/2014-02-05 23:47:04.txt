Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a significant positive impact on Disney's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key factors supporting this view include:

1. Strong performance across all business segments with double-digit operating income growth and margin expansion in each division.

2. Exceptional success of "Frozen" which continues to drive revenue across multiple segments (Studio, Consumer Products, Parks) with significant growth potential still ahead in key markets like China and Japan.

3. Strong momentum in Parks & Resorts with record attendance and successful MyMagic+ implementation showing early benefits.

4. Positive advertising trends at ESPN despite Olympics competition, and healthy affiliate revenue growth.

5. Management's confident tone regarding future franchise opportunities across Marvel, Star Wars, and Disney Animation properties.

The comprehensive strength across divisions, coupled with multiple growth catalysts and management's optimistic outlook, suggests the market will react very favorably to these results.
