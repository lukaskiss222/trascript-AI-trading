Based on my analysis of Disney's Q3 2008 earnings call, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price for the following reasons:

1. Strong performance across key businesses despite economic challenges, particularly in Parks & Resorts which showed resilience with solid bookings and pricing power. The company demonstrated ability to maintain margins and manage costs effectively.

2. Management displayed confidence in their strategy and competitive position, with CEO Bob Iger emphasizing Disney's brand strength and diversified revenue streams (only 20% exposure to advertising). The company continues to generate strong cash flow and maintain share buybacks.

3. While some softness was noted in advertising and certain cost pressures exist, these appear manageable and were offset by strength in other areas. Forward-looking indicators like park bookings remain stable.
