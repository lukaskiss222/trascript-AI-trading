Based on the earnings transcript analysis, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Disney's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with record revenue, net income and EPS for FY2011, with net income up 21% and revenue up 7% year-over-year. Q4 results were particularly strong with net income up 30%.

2. Parks & Resorts showed impressive margin expansion and strong consumer spending metrics, with domestic per capita spending up 9% and room rates up 9%.

3. Multiple growth catalysts highlighted including major park expansions, strong film slate led by Marvel properties, and strategic expansions in emerging markets (Russia, China, India).

4. Management demonstrated disciplined cost control while investing in growth, and expressed confidence in their strategic direction and 2012 outlook.

While there are some macro concerns around consumer spending, the company's strong execution, multiple revenue streams, and clear growth strategy should drive positive sentiment in the near-term.
