I apologize, but I notice the transcript appears to be incomplete - it only shows "Executives" without any actual transcript content. Without the detailed earnings call information, I cannot provide a meaningful analysis of Disney's quarterly performance or make predictions about the stock's likely movement.

If you'd like me to analyze Disney's earnings impact, I'll need the complete transcript containing the actual call details, including:
- Financial results
- Management commentary
- Forward guidance
- Q&A discussions
- Key metrics and performance indicators
