Based on the earnings transcript, I predict a strong positive impact on Disney's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's why:

1. The company reported excellent Q4 and FY2014 results, with record operating income up 21% to $13B and adjusted EPS up 27%. 

2. Management provided very optimistic forward guidance, highlighting an unprecedented slate of 21 tentpole films over next 3 years (vs 13 in past 3 years) across Marvel, Star Wars, Disney Animation and Pixar franchises.

3. Strong performance across all key segments with particularly robust parks & resorts metrics (domestic bookings up 11%) and continued momentum in consumer products.

While there were some minor concerns around cable costs and ad market softness, the overwhelmingly positive results and guidance should drive the stock higher in the near-term.
