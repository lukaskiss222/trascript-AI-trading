I apologize, but I notice the transcript appears to be incomplete - there's only a header for "Executives" with no actual content. Without the detailed earnings call transcript, I cannot provide a meaningful analysis of Disney's earnings or make predictions about the stock's likely movement. Could you please provide the complete transcript so I can offer a proper analysis?
