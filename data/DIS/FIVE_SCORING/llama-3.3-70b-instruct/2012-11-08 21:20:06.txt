The Walt Disney Company's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong record annual performance, driven by improved results in each of its businesses, with net income up 18% for the year on a 3% increase in revenue. The company's leadership expressed confidence in its prospects for fiscal 2013, despite noting several comparability issues and one-time events that may impact Q1 results. The acquisition of Lucasfilm is expected to fit well with Disney's portfolio of assets and brands, and the company is optimistic about its growth potential. Given the strong fundamental performance and the positive outlook, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
