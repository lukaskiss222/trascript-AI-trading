The Walt Disney Company's Q3 earnings call revealed a mix of positive and negative signals. On the positive side, the company's media networks segment, particularly ESPN, delivered strong results, with a 12% increase in operating income. The parks and resorts business also showed solid growth, with a 7% increase in revenue and a 9% increase in operating income. Additionally, the company's film studio had a successful summer with the release of Iron Man 3 and Monsters University. On the negative side, the company's broadcasting segment saw a decline in operating income due to higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue. Furthermore, the company announced a significant loss on the film Lone Ranger, which will impact Q4 results.
