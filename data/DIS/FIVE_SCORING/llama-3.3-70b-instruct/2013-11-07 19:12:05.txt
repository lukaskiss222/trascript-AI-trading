The Walt Disney Company's earnings call revealed a strong performance in fiscal 2013, with record revenue, net income, and EPS. The company's parks and resorts segment delivered solid results, driven by growth in domestic parks and resorts, as well as increased guest spending. The media networks segment saw operating income decline due to timing of affiliate revenue recognition at ESPN, but the company expects this to normalize in the future. Disney's consumer products segment also performed well, with growth in licensing revenue driven by strong demand for Disney Junior properties. The company's guidance for fiscal 2014 suggests continued growth, driven by the opening of Shanghai Disneyland and a strong slate of upcoming movies.
