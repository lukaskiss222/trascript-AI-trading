The Walt Disney Company's Q1 fiscal year 2012 earnings call revealed strong performances from its Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts segments, with an 18% increase in EPS. The company's affiliate revenue growth is expected to pick up in fiscal 2013, driven by new deals with distributors such as Comcast. Disney's focus on expanding its global reach, particularly in emerging markets, is expected to drive long-term growth. The company's investment in new initiatives, such as the Disney Fantasy cruise ship and the Shanghai Disney Resort, is expected to generate significant revenue in the coming years.
