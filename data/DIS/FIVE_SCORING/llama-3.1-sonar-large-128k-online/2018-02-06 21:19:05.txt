The Walt Disney Company's Q1 2018 earnings call presented several key points that are relevant for assessing the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Disney reported a 22% increase in EPS excluding certain items, driven by a robust film slate, strong performance in Parks and Resorts, and benefits from tax reform. This indicates positive momentum and investor confidence[1][2][3].

2. **Direct-to-Consumer Initiatives**: The company is launching a new ESPN app and a Disney direct-to-consumer service, which are expected to be significant growth drivers. These initiatives, particularly the ESPN Plus service, are seen as positive steps in expanding Disney's reach and revenue streams[1][2][3].

3. **Acquisition of 21st Century Fox**: The pending acquisition is anticipated to enhance content production capabilities, expand direct-to-consumer platforms, and diversify the business geographically. This strategic move is viewed positively by management and analysts[1][2][3].

4. **Challenges in Media Networks**: Despite overall strong performance, there were declines in advertising revenue and operating income in the Media Networks segment, partly due to lower political advertising and the impact of the College Football Playoff games. However, digital platforms and affiliate revenue growth are mitigating some of these challenges[1][3].

5. **Positive Outlook**: The company's pipeline of major releases, including "Black Panther," "Avengers: Infinity War," and "Solo: A Star Wars Story," along with expansions in Parks and Resorts, suggests a strong outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year[1][2][3].

Given these points, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is positive, with significant growth initiatives and a strong financial performance. However, there are some short-term challenges in Media Networks that need to be considered.

**Rating: 1**

The stock is likely to experience a positive impact due to the strong earnings, exciting new initiatives, and the pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox, despite some short-term challenges in the Media Networks segment.
