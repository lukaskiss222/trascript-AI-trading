The Walt Disney Company's Q1 2019 earnings call presented a mixed bag of results and outlooks, which could have varying impacts on the stock price in the short term.

### Key Points:
- **Financial Performance**: Disney beat earnings estimates with an EPS of $1.84, but GAAP net income dropped significantly due to higher programming costs and investments in direct-to-consumer (DTC) businesses[1][3][5].
- **Segment Performance**: Media Networks and Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products showed strong results, while Studio Entertainment faced significant declines due to tough comparisons with the previous year's blockbuster releases. DTC & International segment saw increased losses due to investments in ESPN+ and the upcoming launch of Disney+[3][5].
- **DTC Strategy**: The company is heavily investing in DTC initiatives, with a strong focus on Disney+, which is expected to launch later in the year. The integration of 21st Century Fox assets and the use of BAMTech's platform are seen as key drivers for future growth[3][5].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company faces challenging comparisons in the second quarter, particularly in Studio Entertainment, and expects continued investments in DTC to impact operating income. However, long-term growth prospects are optimistic, especially with the addition of Fox assets[3][5].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the mixed results and the ongoing significant investments in DTC businesses, there might be some short-term pressure on the stock. However, the positive reception of the company's strategy and the strong performance in certain segments (Media Networks and Parks) could mitigate this.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term, as investors weigh the current financial performance against the promising long-term strategy and growth potential.
