The Walt Disney Company's first-quarter earnings call highlighted several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Economic Challenges**: Disney faces significant headwinds due to the weak economy, which is affecting consumer spending and advertising revenues. This is expected to continue, impacting various segments of the business.

2. **Cost Reductions**: The company is aggressively reducing costs across all business segments, including personnel reductions, and streamlining operations to mitigate the economic impact. However, these efforts may take time to yield significant results.

3. **Parks and Resorts**: Despite a challenging environment, Disney's parks and resorts have shown resilience, particularly with successful promotions like the "Buy Four Get Three Free" offer. However, this comes with some margin pressure due to increased discounting.

4. **Media Networks**: Cable networks face soft advertising markets, but their structure, heavily reliant on affiliate fees, provides some resilience. The impact of the High School Musical 2 DVD comparison and other secular changes in consumer behavior are notable.

5. **DVD Market**: The DVD business is experiencing secular changes, with consumers being more selective and the economy exacerbating these trends. Disney is adjusting its strategy to focus on quality and price-to-value relationships.

6. **Investments and Growth**: Significant investments are being made in Interactive Media, including video games, Disney.com, and virtual worlds, which are expected to drive future growth but may not immediately contribute to profitability.

Given these points, here are the implications for the stock price:

- The company's efforts to manage costs and adjust to economic and secular changes are positive steps, but the immediate benefits may be limited by the ongoing economic downturn.
- The success of promotional strategies in the parks segment and the resilience of cable networks provide some optimism.
- However, the overall economic and market conditions, along with the challenges in the DVD and broadcasting segments, suggest that short-term gains might be muted.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the economic environment and the challenges in several business segments, despite the company's proactive measures to manage costs and invest in future growth.
