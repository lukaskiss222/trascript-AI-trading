The Walt Disney Company's Q2 2013 earnings call highlighted several positive factors that are likely to have a short-term positive impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Earnings and Revenue Growth**: Disney reported a 10% increase in revenue to $10.55 billion and a 36% increase in earnings per share, driven by strong performance in its studio, parks and resorts, and media networks segments[1][3][5].
- **Successful Investments**: The company's investments in its parks and resorts, such as the transformation of Disney California Adventure and the expansion of Fantasy Land, have started to pay off, leading to increased attendance and spending[3][5].
- **Robust Performance of Media Networks**: ESPN and other cable networks saw significant growth, with operating income up 15% and affiliate revenue growth in the low teens[1][3][5].
- **Positive Outlook for Future Projects**: Disney's upcoming film slate, including Marvel and Star Wars titles, as well as the integration of Lucasfilm, are expected to drive continued growth[3][5].
- **Technological Advancements**: The roll-out of MyMagic Plus is anticipated to enhance the guest experience and drive additional revenue, though its full impact is expected in fiscal 2014[3][5].

Given these strong results and the optimistic outlook for future growth, the stock is likely to experience a positive short-term impact.
