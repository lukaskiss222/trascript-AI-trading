The Walt Disney Company's Q3 FY2017 earnings call and the announcements made during it suggest several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strategic Shift to Direct-to-Consumer Services**: Disney's decision to acquire a majority stake in BAMTech and launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and Disney is a significant strategic move. This shift is expected to provide new revenue streams and greater control over content distribution, which could be viewed positively by investors[5/.

2. **Mixed Quarterly Performance**: Despite the exciting long-term prospects, the third-quarter earnings showed a decrease in EPS and some challenges in the Media Networks segment due to higher programming expenses and lower advertising revenue. However, Parks and Resorts saw an 18% increase in operating income, which is a positive note[2][5].

3. **Investment and Dilution**: The acquisition of BAMTech and the investment in new direct-to-consumer services will result in modest earnings dilution over the next couple of years. This could be a short-term negative factor for the stock[5].

4. **Pricing and Competition**: The company is still determining the pricing strategy for the new services, but there is a focus on achieving widespread distribution and avoiding significant cannibalization of existing businesses. The competitive landscape and how peers react to Disney's moves will also be important factors[5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Disney's stock price is likely to be positive due to the significant and forward-looking strategic announcements, despite some near-term dilution and current quarter challenges.
