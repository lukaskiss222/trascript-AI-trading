The Walt Disney Company's Q3 2011 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Disney reported an 11% increase in net income and a 16% increase in adjusted EPS, driven by strong performance in Media Networks and Parks and Resorts. This positive financial performance is likely to be well-received by investors.

2. **ESPN's Robust Growth**: ESPN's growth, particularly in affiliate revenue and advertising, was a significant contributor to the company's success. The long-term sports rights deals and the expansion of ESPN's multi-platform offerings are positive indicators.

3. **Parks and Resorts**: Despite some cost increases and operational challenges, the segment saw increased guest spending and higher passenger cruise days. The ongoing capital investments in parks projects are expected to drive long-term growth.

4. **Challenging Comparisons in Q4**: The company highlighted several challenging comparisons in the upcoming quarter, including higher programming and production costs at ESPN, difficult syndication sales comparisons for ABC, and tough global box office comparisons for Studio Entertainment. These factors could impact Q4 earnings.

5. **Macro Economic Environment**: While Disney has not seen significant impacts from recent economic news, there is a cautious tone regarding future economic conditions. However, the company's diversified portfolio and strong brand positioning are seen as protective measures.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong Q3 performance and the company's optimistic outlook on its strategic initiatives. However, the cautious notes on Q4 comparisons and macroeconomic conditions might temper some of the enthusiasm.
