The Walt Disney Company's Q3 2009 earnings call reveals several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

### Challenging Economic Environment
Despite the economic downturn, Disney's businesses showed relative strength, with the company emphasizing its commitment to efficiency and long-term strategy. However, the weak economy continued to impact segments like parks and resorts, home video sales, and advertising revenue.

### Mixed Performance
- **Studio Performance:** While films like UP and The Proposal were successful, the overall studio performance was off due to lower home video sales and weaker comparisons to the previous year.
- **Media Networks:** ESPN and Disney Channel performed well, but advertising revenue was impacted by economic conditions and lower ratings.
- **Parks and Resorts:** Promotions helped sustain attendance, but operating income was affected by discounting and softer guest spending.

### Guidance and Outlook
- Disney's guidance suggests stabilization but not yet a clear recovery. The company is managing costs closely and continues to invest in strategic initiatives.
- The company is comfortable with the up-front ad sales process but expects to sell less inventory in the up-front market, potentially benefiting from scatter market sales.

### Strategic Initiatives
- Significant investments in ESPN, including local and international expansions, and new rights deals.
- Expansion plans for parks and resorts, including new cruise ships and international projects.
- Focus on digital initiatives and potential for a Disney-branded online subscription service.

Given these points, here are the implications for the stock:

- **Short-term Pressure:** The lower earnings, impacted by economic conditions and specific segment challenges, may lead to short-term stock pressure.
- **Long-term Optimism:** Disney's strong brand, strategic investments, and focus on cost management suggest long-term growth potential, but this may not immediately translate to short-term stock gains.

### Conclusion

The mixed performance, ongoing economic challenges, and the absence of clear signs of immediate recovery are likely to result in a short-term negative impact on the stock price.
