The Walt Disney Company's Q2 2020 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term:

### Negative Impact Factors
- **Significant Revenue and Earnings Decline**: The company reported a substantial drop in net income and earnings per share (EPS) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 93% decrease in diluted EPS from continuing operations compared to the prior year[2][3].
- **Park Closures and Operational Disruptions**: The closure of domestic parks, cruise lines, and international parks resulted in a significant impact on operating income, estimated at approximately $1 billion for the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment[3].
- **Delayed Film Releases and Production**: The pandemic forced Disney to reschedule several major film releases and halt productions, which will continue to affect the Studio Entertainment segment[3].
- **Furloughs and Cost Cutting**: Despite efforts to mitigate costs, the company had to furlough over 100,000 employees, which, although necessary, adds to the short-term financial strain[3].

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Performance of Disney+**: The subscription service has seen rapid growth, exceeding 54.5 million subscribers, which is a positive sign for the company's direct-to-consumer strategy[3].
- **Resilience and Long-term Optimism**: Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to weather the crisis and recover strongly, highlighting the strength of Disney's brands and the resilience of its business model[3].
- **Liquidity and Financial Management**: The company has taken steps to strengthen its liquidity position, including issuing debt and reducing capital spending, which helps in managing the current financial challenges[3].

### Short-term Outlook
Given the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the immediate financial performance of Disney is expected to remain challenged. The lack of visibility on when parks and other businesses will fully reopen, combined with the ongoing impact on film and TV production, suggests that the stock may face short-term pressure.

### Conclusion
The combination of severe operational disruptions, significant earnings and revenue declines, and ongoing uncertainties about the reopening of key businesses point towards a negative short-term impact on the stock price.
