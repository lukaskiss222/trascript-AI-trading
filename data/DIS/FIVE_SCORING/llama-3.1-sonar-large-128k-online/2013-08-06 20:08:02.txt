The Walt Disney Company's Q3 2013 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points:

1. **Strong Performance in Media Networks**: ESPN and cable networks delivered solid growth, with ESPN's affiliate revenue and advertising sales showing healthy increases despite some ratings challenges[3].
2. **Parks and Resorts**: The segment saw robust growth, driven by increased guest spending, higher ticket prices, and new investments in Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort[3].
3. **Studio Performance**: While the studio had a strong summer with films like Iron Man 3, there were challenges including the poor performance of The Lone Ranger and tough comparisons to Avengers[3].
4. **Consumer Products**: Growth was driven by merchandise licensing, particularly from the inclusion of Star Wars, and higher retail sales[3].
5. **Guidance and Outlook**: Disney expressed confidence in future growth, highlighting upcoming films, new TV shows, and continued investment in Hulu. The company is optimistic about its ability to navigate potential disruptions from new distributors and maintain strong affiliate fee growth[3].

Given these points:

- The company's strong performance in key segments like media networks and parks and resorts, along with its optimistic outlook for future growth, suggest a positive short-term impact.
- However, the loss expected from The Lone Ranger and some headwinds in the broadcast segment might temper the immediate stock reaction.

Overall, the positive drivers are likely to outweigh the negative, leading to a short-term positive impact on the stock.
