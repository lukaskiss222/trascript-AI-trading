The Walt Disney Company's Q2 2011 earnings call revealed several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Mixed Financial Performance**: Despite a 2% increase in diluted EPS, the company's results were impacted by several negative factors, including the poor performance of "Mars Needs Moms," the Easter calendar shift, the Japan earthquake, and acquisition-related costs. These factors collectively reduced operating income by approximately $170 million[3,.

2. **Segment Performance**:
   - Media Networks showed strong growth, driven by affiliate and advertising revenue increases.
   - Parks and Resorts had solid underlying trends, but were affected by external factors like the Easter shift and the Japan earthquake.
   - Studio Entertainment was hit by the poor performance of "Mars Needs Moms" and timing differences in DVD releases.
   - Consumer Products and Interactive Media segments also faced challenges, particularly from acquisition-related costs and market dynamics[3,.

3. **Future Outlook**:
   - The company is optimistic about its upcoming film slate, including "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," "Cars 2," and "Captain America: The First Avenger."
   - Continued growth is expected in key areas like ESPN, Disney Channel, and international parks.
   - Strategic initiatives, such as the Shanghai Disney Resort and expansions in other parks, are underway[3,.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the mixed financial performance and the negative impacts from specific events and film releases. However, the overall optimism about future growth drivers and the company's strategic initiatives could mitigate some of this pressure.
