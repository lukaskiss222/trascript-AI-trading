The Walt Disney Company's Q4 and full-year 2018 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Disney reported record revenue, net income, and earnings per share for fiscal 2018, driven by significant growth in Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts. This strong performance is likely to be viewed positively by investors[3][5].

2. **21st Century Fox Acquisition**: The impending acquisition of 21st Century Fox, with regulatory approvals progressing faster than expected, is a significant positive factor. The integration of Fox's assets, including its television studio and international channels, is expected to enhance Disney's content and distribution capabilities[3].

3. **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Strategy**: The successful launch of ESPN+ and the upcoming launch of Disney+ are key focuses. Disney+ is expected to offer a rich array of content, including original series and films, which could attract a large subscriber base. The optimism around these DTC initiatives is a positive indicator for future growth[3].

4. **Parks and Resorts**: The opening of new lands, such as Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, is anticipated to drive significant attendance and revenue growth in the coming year. This is particularly notable given the historical success of similar expansions like Pandora: The World of Avatar and Toy Story Land[3].

5. **Guidance and Outlook**: While there are some near-term challenges, such as the comparison to the exceptionally strong first quarter of 2018 due to films like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the overall outlook for 2019 remains positive, especially with a robust slate of upcoming films and the continued growth of DTC services[3].

Given these points, the likely short-term impact on the stock price is positive due to the strong financial performance, the progress on the 21st Century Fox acquisition, and the promising outlook for the DTC strategy and new theme park attractions.
