The Walt Disney Company's Q2 FY 2017 earnings call presented several positive and some cautious notes that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Performance in Key Segments**: The company reported a 15% increase in diluted EPS, driven by strong performances in the Studio and Parks and Resorts segments. Parks and Resorts saw a 20% increase in operating income, and the Studio Entertainment segment had a 21% increase in operating income[1][2][3].
- **Successful Film Slate**: The Studio's recent and upcoming films, including "Rogue One," "Beauty and the Beast," "Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2," and several Marvel and Pixar titles, have been highly successful and are expected to continue driving growth[1][2].
- **Expansion and Investment**: Disney is investing heavily in new attractions and expansions at its parks, including the Shanghai Disney Resort, which is performing well above expectations. The company is also expanding its presence in other regions like Hong Kong and Paris[1][2].
- **Direct-to-Consumer Strategy**: Disney's strategy to move into direct-to-consumer streaming services, including the upcoming ESPN-branded service and future plans for other Disney content, is seen as a positive step in adapting to changing consumer habits[1][2][3].

### Cautious Notes
- **Media Networks Challenges**: While revenues were up, operating income at Media Networks was down 3% due to declines at ESPN and lower equity income from Hulu and A&E. Ad revenue was also impacted by lower impressions[1][2][3].
- **ESPN Sub Losses**: Despite growth in new streaming platforms, traditional ESPN subscriber losses continue, although the company is optimistic about the long-term potential of these new platforms[1][2][3].

### Short-Term Impact
Given the overall strong performance across key segments and the positive outlook on future growth initiatives, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. The company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions, its robust film slate, and ongoing investments in growth areas will likely be viewed favorably by investors.
