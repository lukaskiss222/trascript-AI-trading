The Walt Disney Company's Q2 2009 earnings call revealed several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

- **Disappointing Studio Performance**: The studio's poor performance, attributed to weak box office results and lower home video sales, is a significant short-term negative factor. However, the company expressed optimism about upcoming films like "UP," "Princess and the Frog," and "Toy Story 3".

- **Media Networks Resilience**: Despite a challenging economic environment, the media networks segment, led by ESPN and the Disney Channel, performed relatively well. This segment's stability could provide some support to the stock.

- **Parks and Resorts**: While promotional efforts maintained attendance levels, they impacted margins due to increased discounting. However, room reservations for the remainder of the fiscal year are nearly on par with the previous year, indicating some stability in this segment.

- **Advertising Market**: The ad market, particularly for ESPN, showed some resilience despite softness in key categories. However, overall ad revenue remained under pressure.

- **Cost-Cutting Measures**: Disney is implementing significant cost-cutting measures, which could lead to temporary restructuring charges but are expected to make the company more efficient in the long run.

- **International Growth and Digital Strategy**: The company is focused on expanding its international presence and leveraging digital platforms like Hulu, which could offer long-term growth opportunities but may not immediately impact short-term earnings.

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the disappointing studio performance, ongoing economic challenges, and the impact of cost-cutting measures. However, the resilience of the media networks segment and the positive outlook on future content and international growth could mitigate some of this pressure.
