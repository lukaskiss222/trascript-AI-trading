Based on the earnings transcript, Disney's stock is likely to experience a negative impact in the short term due to the following factors:

1. **Underperformance of 21st Century Fox (21CF) businesses**: The acquisition of 21CF has had a dilutive impact on Disney's earnings, with the studio and Direct-to-Consumer & International segments performing below expectations. This is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.

2. **Integration challenges**: The integration of 21CF's assets is complex and time-consuming, which can lead to temporary setbacks in performance. This is evident in the underperformance of the 21CF film studio and the Star brand.

3. **Market uncertainties**: The ongoing protests in Hong Kong and the trade disputes with China have led to a decline in visitation at the Shanghai Disney Resort. While the impact is not reflected in the current quarter's results, it is expected to be felt in the current quarter.

4. **Pricing concerns**: While Disney has raised prices at its domestic parks to manage demand and protect guest experience, this has also led to a gap in pricing with its competitors, such as Universal Studios in Florida. This could potentially impact attendance and revenue in the short term.

5. **Marketing for Disney+**: The launch of Disney+ is expected to be a significant expense, and the impact of this marketing on the stock price is uncertain. However, the company's confidence in its strategy and the quality of its content suggests that the long-term impact should be positive.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Disney's stock price is likely to be negative. However, the long-term prospects for the company, driven by its strong content library and strategic integration of 21CF's assets, remain positive.
