### Analysis

The Walt Disney Company's Q1 2019 earnings call revealed several key points that will impact the stock price in the short term. The company highlighted strong financial results despite headwinds such as difficult comparisons to last year's performance in the studio segment. The earnings per share (EPS) of $1.84 was strong, considering the challenges faced. The company also reported a 7% increase in affiliate revenue at Media Networks, driven by higher rates and the adoption of new revenue recognition standards. However, the sub trend improved modestly, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines.

The most significant news was the launch of ESPN+, which has 2 million paid subscriptions, double the number from just five months ago. The success of the UFC fight on ESPN+ demonstrates the potential of the direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategy. However, the company also noted that the ramp-up of ESPN+ and the upcoming launch of Disney+ will have an adverse impact on operating income in the second quarter.

The management also discussed the integration of 21st Century Fox, which will enhance the DTC efforts and provide opportunities for growth across the company. The addition of content and management talent from 21st Century Fox will help drive the success of Disney+.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price will be positive due to the strong Q1 results, the success of ESPN+, and the potential of the Disney+ launch. However, the company also noted the challenges posed by the ramp-up of DTC services and the integration of 21st Century Fox. The stock is likely to see some volatility in the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the earnings and the outlook for the DTC businesses.
