**Analysis:**

The Walt Disney Company's Q2 earnings call revealed several key points that could impact the stock in the short term. The company reported a 17% increase in operating income, driven by strong performances in Media Networks and Consumer Products. However, the results were impacted by several factors, including the underperformance of Mars Needs Moms, the timing difference of key Pixar DVD releases, and the impact of the Japan earthquake.
