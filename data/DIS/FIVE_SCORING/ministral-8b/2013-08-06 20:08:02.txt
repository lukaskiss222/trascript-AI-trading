**Analysis:**

The Walt Disney Company reported mixed results for Q3 2013, with some segments performing well, while others were impacted by headwinds. Key points include:

- **Media Networks:** ESPN continued to drive growth, with affiliate revenue up 10% (12% excluding deferred revenue). However, lower ratings due to NBA comparability issues were a concern.
- **Broadcasting:** Operating income was down, primarily due to higher prime-time programming costs and lower program sales. ABC Network's affiliate revenue was up, but the increase wasn't sufficient to offset other factors.
- **Parks and Resorts:** Strong performance, with revenue and operating income up 7% and 9% respectively. Attendance and per capita spending were up, but the year-over-year change in margins was adversely impacted by the timing of the Easter holiday.
- **Films:** Iron Man 3 was a success, but the Lone Ranger faced a significant loss. The studio's overall operating income declined due to pre-released marketing expenses for the Lone Ranger and Avengers.
- **Consumer Products:** Growth in merchandise licensing and retail, driven by the inclusion of Star Wars in Q3 results.

**Short-Term Implications:**

- **Stock Price:** The stock price may be impacted by the mixed results and the uncertainty around the Lone Ranger loss. However, the strong performance in parks and resorts, and the potential for growth in non-defense markets, could provide support.
- **Guidance:** The company provided guidance for 2014, with revenue expected to grow in the low double digits and EPS expected to be in the low teens. This should provide some clarity for investors.

**Rating:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral, given the mixed results and the uncertainty around the Lone Ranger loss. However, the company's strong performance in parks and resorts and the potential for growth in non-defense markets could provide some support. Therefore, the rating is:

**0**
