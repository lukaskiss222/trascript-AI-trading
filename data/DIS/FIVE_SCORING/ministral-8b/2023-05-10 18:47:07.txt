### Analysis

The Walt Disney Company's earnings call for Q2 2023 revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported a decline in EPS, driven by the impact of the writer's strike and the challenging macroeconomic conditions. However, there were notable positives, including the success of Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 and the strong performance of the company's parks, especially Shanghai Disney Resort. The company also announced plans to launch a one-app experience for Disney+ and Hulu, which is expected to drive greater engagement and advertising opportunities. Additionally, the company is continuing to focus on cost-cutting measures and content rationalization to improve its financial performance.

### Conclusion

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on Disney's stock price is likely to be mixed. The decline in EPS and the uncertainty surrounding the writer's strike may put downward pressure on the stock. However, the strong performance of the parks and the potential for increased advertising revenue from the one-app experience could provide some support. Overall, the stock is likely to experience some volatility in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain positive.
