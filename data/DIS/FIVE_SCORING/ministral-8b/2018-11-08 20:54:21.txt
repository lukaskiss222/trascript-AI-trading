**Analysis:**

The earnings call for The Walt Disney Company reveals a company that is optimistic about its future growth prospects, particularly in its direct-to-consumer (DTC) businesses. The successful launch of ESPN+ and the upcoming Disney+ service are highlighted as key drivers for future growth. The company also expects to benefit from the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which includes a strong television studio and valuable content. However, there are some challenges to manage, such as the integration of the Fox business and the potential impact of the acquisition on the company's financial results. Overall, the company's strategy seems well-positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for digital content and streaming services.

**Conclusion:**

Given the company's strong financial performance, optimistic outlook on its DTC businesses, and the potential benefits from the 21st Century Fox acquisition, I predict a **positive impact** on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.

**Rating:** 1
