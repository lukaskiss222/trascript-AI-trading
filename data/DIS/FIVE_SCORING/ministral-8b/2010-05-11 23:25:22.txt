The transcript reveals a mixed bag of results for The Walt Disney Company. While the company reported strong second-quarter earnings, driven by successful films like "Alice in Wonderland" and "Iron Man 2," there were also mixed signals about the future. The company's guidance for the third quarter was lower than expected, and there was concern about the cost structure of ESPN, particularly the new channel in the U.K. Additionally, the company's stock has been under pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding the Shanghai park and the potential impact of the euro on bookings. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to these factors.
