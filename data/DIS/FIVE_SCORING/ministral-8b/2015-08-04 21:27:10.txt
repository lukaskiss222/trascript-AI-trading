### Analysis:
The earnings call for The Walt Disney Company presented a mixed bag of results and future projections. The company reported strong Q3 earnings with record net income and earnings per share, driven by robust performance across its various segments. However, the outlook for 2016 included a significant adverse impact from foreign exchange rates, which could moderate cable operating income growth to mid single-digits. The company also faced challenges with subscriber losses at ESPN, though they were less than reported by some research firms. Management expressed optimism about the company's strategy and future prospects, particularly with the upcoming releases of Star Wars and the opening of Shanghai Disneyland. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion:
The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is expected to be negative due to the lowered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Rating:
