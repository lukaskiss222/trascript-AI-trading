### Analysis:

The Walt Disney Companyâ€™s Q1 FY 2017 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported strong financial performance, with Q1 earnings per share of $1.55, a 5% decline compared to the previous year. The decline was driven by the strength of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise sales in Q1 2016, which set a difficult comparison for the current quarter. Despite this, the company's Studio division continues to perform exceptionally well, with all three films released in Q1 being global hits. The company also reported strong growth in its Parks and Resorts segment, driven by the opening of Shanghai Disneyland and improvements at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. However, the company's Media Networks segment reported a 4% decline in operating income due to lower ad revenue at ESPN, which was partially offset by growth in Broadcasting.

### Conclusion:

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the decline in earnings per share and the ongoing challenges in the Media Networks segment. However, the company's strong performance in the Studio and Parks and Resorts segments, along with its optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year, suggests long-term potential. Overall, the stock is likely to remain volatile in the short term but could see a rebound in the coming weeks if the company can address the challenges in its Media Networks segment.
