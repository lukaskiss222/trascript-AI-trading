**Analysis:**

The Walt Disney Company’s earnings call for Q3 2016 revealed a strong performance across all segments, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increasing by 12% to $1.62. The company highlighted its continued success in the Studio segment, with record box office performance and a robust slate of upcoming films. The Parks and Resorts segment also performed well, with Shanghai Disney Resort opening successfully and setting all-time records in attendance and per-cap spending. The Media Networks segment saw modest growth in cable revenue, driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN, while broadcasting revenue declined due to lower network ad revenue and higher programming costs.

The company also announced a significant investment in BAM Tech, a leading video streaming platform, to launch a new direct-to-consumer ESPN-branded service. This move aims to capitalize on the growing demand for streaming services and complement Disney’s existing multichannel offerings. Additionally, Disney signed a new deal with AT&T DirecTV for an over-the-top offering, which will feature all of Disney’s core channels and provide in-season stacking of episodes.

Management expressed confidence in the long-term growth prospects of the company, highlighting the strength of its brands and franchises, as well as its ability to execute in brand-enhancing and value-creating ways. They also emphasized the importance of creating or taking advantage of new opportunities in the digital video space, while maintaining the value of the multichannel bundle.

**Conclusion:**

The Walt Disney Company’s Q3 2016 earnings call demonstrated strong performance across all segments, with record box office performance and successful openings of new parks. The company’s strategic investments in BAM Tech and over-the-top services position it well for future growth. The stock is likely to see positive sentiment in the short term due to the strong performance and strategic moves. However, the stock may face some volatility as investors digest the details of the new investments and their potential impact on the company’s financials.
