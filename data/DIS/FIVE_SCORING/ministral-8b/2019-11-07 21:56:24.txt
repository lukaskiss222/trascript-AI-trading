**Analysis:**

The Walt Disney Company's Q4 and full-year results call highlights the company's robust performance in various segments, particularly in the direct-to-consumer (DTC) business. The launch of Disney+, along with the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, has positioned Disney as a leading player in the streaming market. The company's optimism about the future growth of Disney+ and Hulu, combined with the success of ESPN+, suggests a positive outlook for the DTC segment. However, the company's guidance for the 2020 fiscal year indicates that the DTC businesses will continue to incur significant losses, which could impact the stock in the short term.

**Conclusion:**

The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks due to the company's strong performance and optimistic outlook for its DTC businesses. The launch of Disney+ and the acquisition of 21st Century Fox are significant strategic moves that position Disney as a leader in the streaming market.
