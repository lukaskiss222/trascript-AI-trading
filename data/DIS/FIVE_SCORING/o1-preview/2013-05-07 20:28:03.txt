The Walt Disney Company's strong Q2 results, with EPS up 36% and significant growth across key segments like Studio Entertainment and Parks & Resorts, exceed market expectations. Management's optimistic tone, record-breaking box office performance of "Iron Man 3," and positive guidance signal robust short-term momentum. These factors suggest the stock is poised for a positive impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
