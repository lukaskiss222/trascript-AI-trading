The Walt Disney Company's earnings call highlighted expectations of suppressed earnings growth in fiscal 2018 due to investments in BAMTech and Hulu, higher capital expenditures, and reduced share repurchases. While management expressed optimism about the long-term benefits of their direct-to-consumer strategy and a robust slate of upcoming films, these significant short-term costs may weigh on profitability. As a result, the stock is likely to face negative pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
