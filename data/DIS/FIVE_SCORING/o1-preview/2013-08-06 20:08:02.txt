While Disney reported strong Q3 results with growth in media networks and parks, the announcement of a significant expected loss on "The Lone Ranger" and anticipated Q4 headwinds due to ESPN's deferred revenue may weigh on the stock in the short term. Management's positive outlook and strong future lineup may not fully offset immediate concerns. Therefore, the stock may face slight downward pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
