Disney's strong Q2 results, with EPS up 18%, were driven by exceptional performance in Media Networks and Parks and Resorts. The record-breaking success of "The Avengers" not only boosts current revenues but also signals ongoing strength through sequels, merchandising, and cross-segment opportunities. This positive momentum across core businesses is likely to significantly rally the stock in the short term.
