Disney's earnings call revealed challenges, with significant declines in studio entertainment and cautious outlooks in parks and consumer products due to the weak global economy. While management noted cost-cutting measures and some signs of stabilization, the disappointing results and acknowledgment of ongoing uncertainties may lead to short-term negative sentiment. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
