The Walt Disney Company reported robust quarterly results with adjusted EPS up 12%, marking their 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Strategic investments like the stake in BAM Tech and the successful launch of Shanghai Disney Resort signal strong future prospects. Combined with a solid movie slate and continued strength in Parks and Resorts, the stock is likely to see a positive short-term impact.
