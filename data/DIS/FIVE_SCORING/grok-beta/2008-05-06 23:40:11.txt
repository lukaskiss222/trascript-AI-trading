Disney's Q2 results demonstrated resilience despite economic headwinds, with a strong 35% EPS growth, a diversified business model leveraging branded content, and optimism about upcoming releases like "Prince Caspian" and "WALLâ€¢E". However, potential risks include any labor disputes like a strike, which could impact operations, and ongoing economic challenges affecting consumer behavior. The stock might see a slight positive bounce due to immediate positive financial news, but it might be tempered by broader market concerns.
