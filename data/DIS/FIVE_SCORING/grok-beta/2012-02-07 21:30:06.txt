Disney's Q1 earnings showed robust growth in major segments like ESPN and Parks and Resorts, with an EPS increase of 18% year-over-year. Key strategic moves, including international expansion and new domestic initiatives, are positive for future growth. However, there are concerns over potential costs related to significant capital expenditures and new investments for 2012, which might offset some of the near-term revenue gains. While the new Comcast deal promises enhanced future revenue, the full financial impact will unfold over the coming years and not significantly in the immediate near term. Overall, these elements suggest a cautious but optimistic outlook for the stock in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
