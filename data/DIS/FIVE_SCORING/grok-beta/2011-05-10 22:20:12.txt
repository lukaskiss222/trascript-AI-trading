The Disney earnings for the second quarter of 2011 showed a complex landscape with several factors impacting far-term performance. Positive advertising revenue growth at ESPN and ABC is encouraging, but significant events like the disappointing 'Mars Needs Moms' performance and the timing of Pixar DVD releases weighed down the Studio Entertainment segment. Furthermore, the Easter calendar shift and the Japanese earthquake negatively affected Parks and Resorts. The recent opening of 'Thor,' along with the potential success of 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides', could provide some positive momentum, but overall, the ongoing challenges in the Media Networks segment (like lower equity income from ESPN Star Sports and the lapping of strong prior year ad revenues) suggest a neutral impact on stock price in the short term.
