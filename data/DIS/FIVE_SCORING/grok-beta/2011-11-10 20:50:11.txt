The Walt Disney Company's Q4 and fiscal 2011 earnings call revealed several positive indicators, including record revenue, net income, and EPS, with a 21% growth in net income and a 23% increase in EPS year-over-year. Despite the general economic challenges, Disney's performance in media networks and parks, coupled with strategic expansions in key international markets and IP-driven franchises, suggests a sustained short-term momentum for the stock. However, some of the growth initiatives will have costs in 2012 that could temper the stock's immediate upward movement.
