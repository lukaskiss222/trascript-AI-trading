Disney reported a strong financial performance for Q4 and the full year of 2013, with growth across multiple segments like Interactive, Consumer Products, and Parks and Resorts. The announcements of Marvel series for Netflix, and setting a release date for the next Star Wars film, signal both near and long-term positive impact for Disneyâ€™s stock. However, the negative effect from the ESPN revenue deferral and the need for significant capital expenditure for Shanghai Disney could pose short-term uncertainties or investor concerns, potentially balancing positive news. Given the mix of positive and potential short-term negative impacts, the stock is likely to see a neutral impact over the next 1-2 weeks.
