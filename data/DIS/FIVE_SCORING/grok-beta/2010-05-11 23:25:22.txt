Disney's Q2 earnings suggest a mixed but mostly positive short-term impact on the stock price. While revenue and earnings per share grew, flat results in Media Networks and concerns over Parks and Resorts pricing strategy could introduce some hesitancy. However, the robust performance of "Alice in Wonderland" and anticipation for "Toy Story 3" along with ongoing strategic investments and Marvel synergy efforts point towards future growth potential. Disney's confidence in achieving normal pricing levels at Parks and their handling of cost structures at ESPN imply a managed approach to growth amidst economic recovery, likely supporting a positive stock movement.
