The Disney Company's third quarter earnings call in 2012 revealed robust financial performance, with a record EPS and increased profitability across all sectors. However, several factors suggest a mixed short-term impact on the stock:

- **Positive Performance**: The Studio segment significantly outperformed expectations led by the phenomenal global box-office run of "Marvel’s The Avengers." There's a strong upcoming film slate, suggesting continued earnings potential. 
- **Park and Resort Investments**: Major capital investments peaking this year provide long-term growth potential, though the short-term impact on cash flow could weigh on stock in 1–2 weeks.
- **Advertising Impact**: The Olympics might cause a short-term of advertising revenue.

In summary, the positive earnings results are somewhat offset by concerns over near-term spending, competition, elevated operating costs, the scatter market, and the Olympics. Analysts might view Disney's stock as having limited room for a significant short-term upward movement due to these factors.
