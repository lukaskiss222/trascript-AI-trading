The Walt Disney Company's Q2 2009 earnings call highlights several factors that suggest a cautious outlook for the company's stock in the short-term. Disney's movie studio significantly underperformed due to a challenging film slate, although upcoming releases like "UP" and "Princess and the Frog" hold potential for positive movement. However, management's focus on cost reduction and restructuring, coupled with a slowing but stable global economy, could reassure investors of long-term viability, especially with initiatives like Hulu that aim to adapt to shifting media consumption habits. These elements balance out to suggest any significant stock movement will be tempered in the short term.
