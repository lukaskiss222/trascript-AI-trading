The Walt Disney Company’s fiscal year 2012 performance was strong, with record financial results across its segments, boosted by successes like Marvel’s The Avengers, Pixar's films, and growth in the Parks and Resorts. However, the upcoming first quarter of 2013 faces challenging comparisons in home entertainment, cable programming costs, and potential impacts from Superstorm Sandy, which could lead to a short-term dip in earnings. Nevertheless, strategic investments and acquisitions like Lucasfilm signal Disney’s long-term growth strategy, likely offsetting any immediate effects. These factors suggest a short-term impact that might be less significant than typical cyclical fluctuations.
